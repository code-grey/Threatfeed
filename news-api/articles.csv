Volkswagen is bringing physical buttons back to the dashboard with the ID. Polo EV,"We could be witnessing the start of the renaissance for real buttons in cars, courtesy of Volkswagen&#39;s ID. Polo. The German automaker unveiled the interior of its upcoming compact EV, which features real buttons, switches and even a knob for audio controls.
&#34;We have created an interior that feels like a friend from the very first contact,&#34; Volkswagen&#39;s chief designer, Andreas Mindt, said in a press release. &#34;Clear physical buttons provide stability and trust, warm materials make it appealing, and charming details such as the new retro views of the instruments show the typical Volkswagen wink.&#34;
Volkswagen
Last year, Mindt told Autocar that Volkswagen would commit to reintroducing physical buttons for the most important functions &#34;in every car we make from now on,&#34; starting with the ID. 2all concept car that has since evolved to become the ID. Polo. The EV maker backed up those claims since the ID. Polo will feature tangible buttons underneath the infotainment display, along with a steering wheel that&#39;s packed with even more clear buttons. Between the driver and passenger, Volkswagen even included a knob that can adjust audio volume or shuffle between tracks and radio stations.
Volkswagen
Besides the renewed emphasis on physical controls, Volkswagen still included a 10.25-inch digital cockpit behind the steering wheel. In the center, there&#39;s a nearly 13-inch touchscreen that serves as the infotainment system. For a retro throwback, the ID. Polo can swap its cockpit display to one that&#39;s inspired by the classic Golf I from the 1980s through a button on its steering wheel or with the infotainment touchscreen.
The ID. Polo is expected to be the first of four new EVs in Volkswagen&#39;s small and compact car segment, which will see releases in European markets starting this year. However, it&#39;s not all good news, since Volkswagen has no plans to release the compact EV in the US.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/volkswagen-is-bringing-physical-buttons-back-to-the-dashboard-with-the-id-polo-ev-190246116.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2026-01%2F86aea740-e8d0-11f0-a95f-6a9da86997aa&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=3d46217963e6c4701f9c7168d8b761d68f73684c,https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/volkswagen-is-bringing-physical-buttons-back-to-the-dashboard-with-the-id-polo-ev-190246116.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2026-01-03T19:02:46Z,7,Tech
How to watch the Hyundai CES 2026 presentation live,"A look at Hyundai&#39;s Holographic Windshield Display. (Hyundai)
CES has long felt like a full-on auto show, but the car-centric energy seems somewhat muted at CES 2026. Sure, the Afeela electric vehicle from the Sony-Honda joint venture is returning to the show floor, but with the Trump administration yanking most EV incentives from the market, the industry isn&#39;t offering a full-court press of new vehicles in Las Vegas this year. That said, there&#39;s no shortage of in-cabin car tech on display, including Hyundai&#39;s Holographic Windshield Display. 
Indeed, the company&#39;s Mobis subsidiary will present &#34;more than 30 mobility convergence technologies&#34; during CES. And we&#39;ll also get to see Hyundai&#39;s AI Robotics Strategy, which will showcase its new Atlas robot fresh out of the lab.
How to watch Hyundai&#39;s presentation at CES 2026
Hyundai&#39;s presentation takes place on January 5 at 4PM ET, and you can livestream it on either its HyundaiUSA YouTube channel or its global YouTube channel. We&#39;ll embed the stream here once it&#39;s available.
What to expect
As mentioned above, Hyundai will have its Holographic Windshield Display for viewing. It&#39;s essentially a next-gen heads-up display that projects key data from the vehicle&#39;s dash on the windshield for less distraction, and without obstructing the driver&#39;s view. It&#39;s a vertically expandable 18.1-inch large display, and passengers can even watch videos without being visible to the driver.
Hyundai Mobis collaborated with German optics specialist Zeiss to develop the &#34;world&#39;s first system to utilize holographic film to transform the entire front windshield into an ultra-large display surface.&#34; It says it will begin mass production in 2029, so don&#39;t expect to see this on the market anytime soon.
Beyond automotive, though, we&#39;ll also get a first-ever look at the company&#39;s new Atlas robot. In the teaser image shown in the press release, Atlas looks rather dog-like, which makes sense when you remember that Boston Dynamics was purchased by the Korean multinational back in 2020.
&#34;This next-generation Atlas represents a tangible step toward the commercialization of AI Robotics, highlighting the Group’s commitment to building safe and adaptable robotic co-workers,&#34; the company said in the same press release.
Hyundai said it will also discuss its other tech areas, including electronics and chassis system safety, as well as an AR head-up display, low-power display solutions and EV drive systems.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/how-to-watch-the-hyundai-ces-2026-presentation-live-190051072.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-08%2F45fa49c0-847b-11f0-9bf6-172608c15ed6&resize=1400%2C931&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=162677b4bab02fe3366d0e1b8b08aca43ab4bddd,https://www.engadget.com/transportation/how-to-watch-the-hyundai-ces-2026-presentation-live-190051072.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2026-01-03T19:00:37Z,10,Tech
California introduces a one-stop shop to delete your online data footprint,"Californians can now put a stop to their personal data being sold around on an online trading floor, thanks to a new free tool. On January 1, the state launched its Delete Request and Opt-out Platform, shortened to DROP, that allows residents to request to delete all of their personal information online that&#39;s been harvested by data brokers.
According to the California Privacy Protection Agency (CalPrivacy), which was responsible for DROP&#39;s release, it&#39;s a &#34;first of its kind&#34; tool that imposes new restrictions on businesses that hoard and sell personal info that consumers didn&#39;t provide directly. The process requires verifying your California residency before you can send a &#34;single deletion request to every registered data broker in California.&#34;
On the other end, CalPrivacy will require data brokers to register every year and to process any deletion requests from DROP. Data brokers will also have to report the type of information they collect and share, while also being subject to regular audits that check for compliance. If any data broker is found skirting the requirements, they could face penalties and fines.
Besides being the first in the country to offer this type of comprehensive tool that deletes online personal data, CalPrivacy said it&#39;s one of four states, including Oregon, Texas and Vermont, to require data broker registration. According to the agency, data brokers will start processing the first deletion requests from DROP starting August 1, 2026.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/california-introduces-a-one-stop-shop-to-delete-your-online-data-footprint-173102064.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2026-01%2Fab440b50-e8c5-11f0-befe-5b7c5b09786f&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=fc7223806662112b30a69bce5b76f09d79c2746a,https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/california-introduces-a-one-stop-shop-to-delete-your-online-data-footprint-173102064.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2026-01-03T17:31:02Z,7,Tech

CES 2026: What to expect from tech's big January conference,"The new year is upon us, and that means CES 2026 is imminent. The biggest tech trade show of the calendar comes with a bevy of new and notable announcements that set the tone for trends and expectations for the subsequent 12 months. The CES 2026 show floor is officially open from January 6 through 9, but the fun kicks off with events on Sunday January 4, followed by a host of press conferences on Monday. As always, product demos, announcements and networking will be happening at the Las Vegas Convention Center and other hotels all over the city. As usual, Engadget will be covering the event in-person and remotely, bringing you news and hands-ons straight from the show floor.More specific details and pre-announcements are already trickling out as CES approaches, and thanks to the schedule of the Consumer Technology Association (the trade organization that runs the show) we have a full itinerary of press conferences. We’re also using our experience and expertise to predict what tech trends could rear their heads at the show.The CES 2026 schedulePress conferences and show floor booths are the bread and butter of CES. The CTA has already published a searchable directory of who will have an official presence at the show, along with a schedule of every official panel and presentation. However, the press conference schedule gives us a more digestible rundown of the first 48 hours of big events. On Sunday, January 4, Samsung will kick-off CES with &#34;The First Look,&#34; a presentation hosted by TM Roh, the CEO of Samsung&#39;s DX Division, on the company&#39;s &#34;vision for the DX (Device eXperience) Division in 2026, along with new AI-driven customer experiences.&#34; Ahead of that, though, Samsung has already outlined a variety of more specifics (scroll down for details).  Concurrent with the Samsung presentation will be the official CES Unveiled mini-show, which is generally comprised of smaller and start-up vendors. That&#39;ll be followed by multiple press conferences throughout Monday, January 5. The LG CES 2026 press conference, titled &#34;Innovation in Tune with You,&#34; is ostensibly to share &#34;its vision for elevating daily life through Affectionate Intelligence.&#34; But, like Samsung, this fellow Korean giant has already spent the three weeks leading up to CES pre-announcing many of its new products, so this may be more of a summary than breaking news. Following LG, we’ll also see press conferences from Bosch and Hisense, as well as the first-ever CES appearance from Lego. As the Las Vegas afternoon rolls around, we get the first of three chip giants: NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang takes the stage on January 5 at 1PM PT (4PM ET) and, according to the website, his presentation will last about 90 minutes. Based on the description on the listing, the presentation will “showcase the latest NVIDIA solutions driving innovation and productivity across industries.” NVIDIA’s presser is concurrent with one from Hyundai, where the Korean automotive company will focus on in-cabin car tech and robotics. Later in the day, we get to hear from NVIDIA frenemies Intel and AMD. Intel’s 3PM PT (6PM PT) event will ostensibly feature its new Core Ultra Series 3 processors, and AMD CEO Lisa Su will cover AMD&#39;s upcoming chip announcements at a keynote address that closes out the day. But expect both of them to be very heavy on AI applications, of course. Sandwiched in between those chip manufacturers will be Sony Honda Mobility. The joint venture will be offering yet more details on its Afeela EV. Finally, on Tuesday, January 6, Lenovo CEO Yuanqing Yang will host Lenovo&#39;s Tech World Conference at the Las Vegas Sphere, using the large and decidedly curved screen to share the company&#39;s &#34;commitment to delivering smarter AI for all by constantly redefining how technology can engage, inspire, and empower.&#34; It’s worth noting that Lenovo is the parent company of Motorola, which still makes phones and foldables that feature AI tools, so it’s possible those devices feature in the presentation as well. Samsung and LG vie for pre-show publicityAs noted above, both Samsung and LG have continued their recent trend of spoiling nearly all of their respective CES announcements in the days and weeks before the show. LG, for example, has said it will debut its first Micro RGB television at CES. While details are scarce, the company’s press release for the LG Micro RGB evo did confirm it has received certifications by Intertek for 100 percent color gamut coverage in DCI-P3 an Adobe RGB, and that it has more than a thousand dimming zones for brightness control. Elsewhere in the TV space, LG is throwing its hat into the “art TV” ring that Samsung pioneered with its Frame TVs: The LG Gallery TV will debut in 55- and 65-inch screen sizes, and it will of course show off various artwork when it’s not otherwise in use. And if PC gaming displays are more your speed, LG will have that covered, too, with a new line of 5K-capable gaming monitors on deck with built-in AI upscaling.But LG’s not just showing off displays. The Korean multinational will also introduce a Dolby-powered modular home audio system, a new line of its xboom speakers (developed with will.i.am) and the company will flex its automation muscles with a humanoid home automation robot named CLOiD. We’re also looking forward to checking out the company’s new ultralight Aerominum laptops.Of course, Samsung refuses to be outdone by its hometown rival, and has also released a pre-CES press release document dump. Samsung will be launching its own lineup of Micro RGB TVs at CES, for starters. The company already introduced its first Micro RGB TV at CES 2025, which was a 115-inch model available for a cool $30,000. Next year, Samsung is expanding the range with 55-, 65-, 75-, 85-, 100- and 115-inch models that use the next evolution of the company’s Micro RGB technology. Samsung is also countering LG’s 5K monitors with a 6K model that aims to deliver glasses-free 3D (another long-time CES staple). It’ll be one of several new displays in the company’s Odyssey gaming line. And the company is also updating its Freestyle projector for 2026, too. And on the audio front, Samsung has teased several new soundbars and speakers, including Sonos-style Wi-Fi streaming models call the Music Studio 5 and Studio 7.Outside of the formal introduction of new products and initiatives, reading the tea leaves of what was announced last year and what companies are reportedly working on, we can make some educated guesses at what we could see at CES 2026.New chips from AMD, Intel and QualcommCES is frequently the start of a cascade of new chip announcements for a given year, and one of the first places new silicon appears in real consumer products. AMD will likely use its keynote to introduce new versions of its Ryzen chips, including the recently spotted Ryzen 7 9850X3D, which is expected to offer better single-threaded performance, and the Ryzen 9000G series, which could be built with AMD&#39;s Zen 5 architecture. The company might also use its CES stage to go over its new FSR Redstone AI upscaling tech.Intel has already publicly announced that it&#39;ll launch its Panther Lake chips at CES 2026. The officially titled Intel Core Ultra Series 3 chips fit into Intel&#39;s overall &#34;AI PC&#34; push, but are specifically meant for premium laptops. Based on a preview from October 2025, Intel says the first chip made with its 2-nanometer 18A process will offer 50 percent more processing performance than previous generations and for the chip&#39;s Arc GPU, a 50 percent performance bump from last generation.Qualcomm is also rumored to be targeting laptops at the show, building on the work it&#39;s done moving its Snapdragon chips out of phones and tablets and into other types of computers. The company&#39;s Snapdragon X2 Elite and X2 Elite Premium chips should start appearing in laptops at CES 2026, offering a look at the improved speed and AI performance the company promised in 2025.Brighter, &#34;truer&#34; screensAs noted above, Samsung and LG appear to be going all-in on Micro RGB display tech for TVs. Expect that to be a huge buzzword at CES, with Hisense and Sony debuting new models, too.Sony announced a collection of new Bravia TVs in April 2025, replacing the company&#39;s flagship, filling in its midrange options and adding a new budget model to the mix. The star of this updated Bravia lineup is the Bravia 9, which features a QD-OLED panel, but Sony appears to be prepping entirely new display tech for 2026. In March 2025, Sony introduced a new RGB LED panel that uses individual Mini LED backlights colored in red, green and blue to produce even brighter, more accurate colors. In contrast to a QD-OLED, which filters a layer of blue organic light emitting diodes through quantum dots that change color, Sony&#39;s &#34;General RGB LED Backlight Technology&#34; can get as bright as a Mini LED panel without needing an extra filter layer or worrying about OLED&#39;s problems with burn-in. The company has already trademarked the name &#34;True RGB,&#34; which could end up being what Sony calls this new flavor of display if it decides to show them off at CES. It seems entirely likely, because CES is nothing if not a TV show — it’s a sure bet that we’ll see new TVs from the likes of LG and Samsung in addition to Sony. If the company doesn&#39;t introduce new display tech for its TVs, it does have a new 240Hz PlayStation monitor coming in 2026 that it could show off at CES instead.Sony isn&#39;t the only company hyped on bright screens. Samsung is reportedly pushing an updated version of the HDR10 and HDR10+ standards that could be ready to demo at CES 2026. The new HDR10+ Advanced standard would be Samsung&#39;s answer to Dolby Vision 2, which includes support for things bi-directional tone mapping and intelligent features that automatically adapt sports and gaming content. Samsung&#39;s take will reportedly offer improved brightness, genre-based tone mapping and intelligent motion smoothing options, among other improvements.And maybe your future TV won’t need a power cord, either: Displace will be showing off a mounting option that includes a 15,000mAh battery to juice up whatever giant TV screen you choose to attach.Ballie Watch 2026The ball-shaped yellow robot lovingly known as &#34;Ballie&#34; has been announced twice, first in 2020 and then again in 2024 with a projector in tow. Samsung said Ballie would go on sale in 2025 at CES last year and then shared in April 2025 that Ballie would ship this summer with Google&#39;s Gemini onboard. But it&#39;s nearly 2026, and Ballie is nowhere to be seen. It&#39;s possible Samsung could make a third attempt at announcing its robot at CES 2026, but whether or not it does, robotics will still be a big part of the show.Robot vacuums and mops were a major highlight of CES 2025, and it&#39;s safe to expect notable improvements from the new models that are announced at CES 2026. Not every company will adopt the retractable arm of the Roborock Saros Z70, but robot vacuums with legs for rising over small ledges like the Dreame X50 seem like they could become the norm. Roborock could also show off its new Roborock Qrevo Curv 2 Flow, the first of its robot vacuums to feature a retractable roller mop.Beyond just traversing spaces more efficiently, improving robots&#39; navigation could also be a major concern at the show. Prominent members of the AI industry are turning their attention from large language models to world models, which aim to give AI a deep understanding of physical space. Those world models could be the key to making robots — like LG’s aforementioned CLOiD — competent at navigating homes and workplaces, and will likely be a significant talking point at CES 2026.We’ll be updating this article throughout the month as more rumors surface and new products are confirmed — stay tuned for future updates!Update, December 11 2025, 11:03AM ET: This story has been updated to include detail on Lenovo being Motorola’s parent company and how the latter might have a part in the Tuesday presentation.Update, December 16 2025, 1:33PM ET: This story has been updated to include the NVIDIA press conference, which was added to the CTA schedule within the last two days.Update, December 23 2025, 7:28AM ET: This story has been updated to include LG and Samsung’s Micro RGB TV announcements, which were made public in the past seven days.

"CES 2026: all the news, gadgets, and innovations from the biggest tech show","Hot on the heels of new year’s celebrations, the annual Consumer Electronics Show will get underway in early January 2026. Once again, Las Vegas will host a sprawling sneak peek at the tech that will shape the industry throughout 2026.

How to watch the Bosch CES 2026 press conference live on Monday,"You might recognize Bosch as a home appliance name (thanks to its partnership with Siemens), but the German multinational brand&#39;s core business is really about providing the underlying technology and engineering that powers cars, homes and factories around the world. That focus is reflected at CES 2026, where much of what Bosch is unveiling is intended to be licensed to other companies rather than sold as Bosch-branded products on store shelves.
Case in point is Bosch&#39;s automotive plans at CES. The company is showcasing what it calls &#34;AI in the car,&#34; or more specifically, in the cockpit of the car. &#34;Bosch&#39;s AI-powered cockpit makes driving more comfortable, intuitive, and safer for all occupants,&#34; Bosch board member Markus Heyn said in a press release. We&#39;ll get into all the details below, as well as how to tune in to the press conference on Monday.
How to watch Bosch&#39;s CES 2026 presentation
You can livestream the event on Monday, January 5 at 12PM ET via the Bosch press page or YouTube. (We&#39;ve embedded the stream link below.)

What to expect
Bosch will be setting up shop in the Central Hall of the Las Vegas Convention Center (booth 16203), where the company will be focusing on its three big themes — mobility, smart home integrations and manufacturing — all of which will include hardware, software and AI solutions.
Like many other CES 2026 exhibitors, look for Bosch to emphasize its partnerships with the big dogs of the AI space at the show. For instance, that AI-powered car cockpit mentioned above will feature integrations with both Microsoft and NVIDIA. For instance, Bosch is touting the ability to use voice commands to join a Teams call, while the car&#39;s system will automatically activate adaptive cruise control. And it&#39;s noting that NVIDIA&#39;s software suites will help manage &#34;real-time sensor processing and vision-language models.&#34;
Here&#39;s a glimpse of what the booth will look like:

Prices for an old Star Wars game have ballooned because of its role in a PS5 jailbreak,"The price for a PS4 copy of  the relatively obscure Star Wars racing game, Star Wars Racer Revenge, has dramatically increased in the last few days because of the game’s use in the latest PlayStation 5 jailbreak, Eurogamer reports. The PS2 game was originally released in 2002, and was ported to PS4 by Limited Run Games in 2019. Its role as a key ingredient in the jailbreaking process was announced on December 31.Interested jailbreakers need Racer Revenge to jailbreak PS5 12.00 firmware because of a bug in the game&#39;s Hall of Fame feature, according to Eurogamer. The bug makes it possible to inject new code into Sony&#39;s console, and because the PS5 is able to load and play PS4 discs, Star Wars Racer Revenge is an easier method to pull the jailbreak off. Retail releases of games are a common way to execute exploits and hacks because, unlike digital copies, they can’t be directly patched.While the PS4 version of Star Wars Racer Revenge was available for anywhere between $14.99 to $37.50 when it went on sale originally, used copies are currently listed for as high as $411 on eBay. Sellers are naturally trying to capitalize on the game&#39;s new position in the jailbreaking meta and raising the price accordingly. Of course, it helps that there&#39;s only a small number of copies to go around. As the company&#39;s name suggests, Limited Run Games releases old games in limited quantities as collector items. The company only ever made 8,500 copies of Racer Revenge per its own data, so the game is already rare in some sense, and now expensive to boot while there&#39;s interest in the PS5 jailbreak.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/prices-for-an-old-star-wars-game-have-ballooned-because-of-its-role-in-a-ps5-jailbreak-230604276.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2FLimited-Run-Games-Star-Wars-Racer-Revenge.jpg&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=4719555198d6442fb156ad7c34800fcd676c1a51,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/prices-for-an-old-star-wars-game-have-ballooned-because-of-its-role-in-a-ps5-jailbreak-230604276.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2026-01-02T23:06:04Z,7,Tech

"How to watch Samsung's ""First Look"" CES 2026 presentation on Sunday","NurPhoto via Getty Images
Samsung is arguably the 800-pound gorilla of CES, with a full spectrum of products that range from phones and computers to refrigerators, AI assistants and rolling robots. But for CES 2026, the company is switching things up a bit: Instead of its longtime midday Monday press conference, the Korean giant will take the lead of the show with a Sunday night presentation.
Over the past few weeks, Samsung has been dropping hints about what&#39;s on the agenda, but what we&#39;re really hoping to see is an update on the Ballie robot — a star of previous CES presentations that ostensibly missed its previously promised 2025 release date.
How to watch Samsung&#39;s &#34;The First Look&#34; presentation at CES 2026
The event will stream live from the Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas on Sunday, January 4 at 10PM ET. There are several ways to tune in: you can watch via the Samsung Newsroom, Samsung Electronics’ official YouTube channel or via Samsung TV Plus. (We&#39;ll embed the stream here once it appears on the channel.)
What to expect from Samsung at CES 2026
Keynote speaker TM Roh, the CEO of Samsung&#39;s Device eXperience (DX) Division, will discuss the company&#39;s plans for the new year and beyond, which will (of course) include &#34;new AI-driven customer experiences,&#34; the company said in a press release. In addition, we&#39;ll hear from the President and Head of the Visual Display Business, SW Yong and Executive Vice President and Head of Digital Appliances Business, Cheolgi Kim. Those two will &#34;share their respective business directions for the upcoming year.&#34;
But if you&#39;re looking for more specifics, Samsung is following its &#34;Advent calendar&#34; approach to early CES announcements, with new press releases dropping nearly every day. So far, we know that — like competitors LG and Hisense — the company will be offering details on a line of micro RGB TVs (replete with confirmed screen sizes of 55 to 115 inches). Also confirmed: a full line of appliances infused with what Samsung calls Bespoke AI. Samsung will also display its two newest speakers, Music Studio 5 and 7, at CES this year. Additionally, it&#39;ll debut its latest Freestyle+ portable projector.
Just before the holidays, Samsung also unveiled a slew of new gaming monitors, but most impressive is the Odyssey gaming monitor. It boasts a 32-inch 6K screen and has glasses-free 3D. It&#39;s likely we could see this at CES, along with other models like the 27-inch Odyssey G6 and the Odyssey G8 models.
Samsung will likely continue to map out its CES plans in greater detail as the January 4 event approaches, so we&#39;ll keep updating this story as it does.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/how-to-watch-samsungs-first-look-ces-2026-presentation-on-sunday-190027889.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F67724120-dd18-11f0-b7f5-5ab143ff1f4e&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=48e24ea1f494a88c70f7a5e0932d5df3ae95cd11,https://www.engadget.com/mobile/how-to-watch-samsungs-first-look-ces-2026-presentation-on-sunday-190027889.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2026-01-02T20:00:35Z,8,Tech

Where are Engadget's CES 2025 winners now?,"With CES 2026 slated to officially start next week, the focus is understandably on all the new products that will be announced at this year&#39;s event. But before diving into what’s new, we thought it was a good idea to revisit our best of show winners from last year to see where they&#39;re at. After all, CES is synonymous with vaporware. The good news is the Engadget team has a keen sense for BS. Of the ones we awarded at CES 2025 that haven’t been released, most are coming this year. For the remaining few, we’ll be hunting them down this CES.ASUS Zenbook A14An Asus Zenbook A14 sits out a patio table. Devindra Hardawar for EngadgetWhen we saw the ASUS Zenbook A14 at CES 2025, it left us impressed with its lightweight but well-made chassis, beautiful OLED screen and excellent mix of ports. After spending more time with it, the A14&#39;s shortcomings became more apparent. In his review of the ultraportable, Engadget&#39;s Devindra Hardawar gave the laptop a score of 78, lamenting its poor performance and expensive price tag. In the end, it wasn&#39;t quite the Windows MacBook Air competitor he had hoped for initially.   BioLite Backup The BioLite Backup powers a Galan2 fridge. Amy Skorheim for EngadgetAt CES 2025, BioLite was already taking pre-orders for its automatic home backup power supply. The BioLite Backup didn&#39;t arrive in 2025, but if you visit the company&#39;s website today, you can reserve one for $100, with final pricing expected to start at $2,000. BioLite says units will start shipping this year.       Jackery Solar RoofA CES display shows the Jackery XBC solar panels in obsidian.Jess Conditt for EngadgetBefore CES 2025, Jackery was already an established player in the domestic solar power industry, and at the event, it impressed us with its XBC curved solar shingles. They look like regular roof shingles, but Jackery said they would deliver cell conversion efficiency of more than 25 percent.  It&#39;s taken longer than anticipated, but Jackery says it now expects the shingles to go on sale in the US &#34;very soon,&#34; with pricing likely to range between $1,100 and $1,300 per square meter depending on the customer&#39;s design requirements and how they purchase the product. When contacted by Engadget, Jackery also teased a handful of announcements for CES 2026, including updates on devices like the Solar Mars Robot it&#39;s been working on for the last little while. Lenovo Legion Go SThe Lenovo Legion Go S sits on an opaque glass table with a comic book behind it. Sam Rutherford for EngadgetWith the Legion Go S, Lenovo promised two different versions of its new handheld: one running Windows 11, and the other Valve&#39;s Steam OS. Unfortunately, the Windows variant arrived first (shortly after CES), and was about as good as expected. However, the wait for the SteamOS model was well worth it. When Engadget&#39;s Sam Rutherford finally reviewed it over the summer, he praised it for fast performance, bright display and of course the ease of use offered by SteamOS. LG OLED evo M5A man and his dalmatian gaze at a 77-inch LG OLED TV.LGLG&#39;s OLED TVs are a perennial CES favorite at Engadget, and the company&#39;s 2025 slate was no different. The flagship evo M5 model impressed with its 165Hz refresh rate for gaming, better image processing for lower resolution content and a wireless transmission system for video and audio. At $4,300, the set is expensive, but the good news is LG typically does a good job of trickling down features to its more  affordable sets, and I&#39;m sure the company will continue to improve on its OLED technology this year.Moonbird Moonbuddy  A hand holds the Moonbird Moonbuddy. The device has the teddy sleeve on. MoonbirdThe Moonbuddy was one of two &#34;cute&#34; gadgets that made Engadget&#39;s best of CES 2025 list. We liked Moonbird&#39;s decision to make a screenless meditation and sleep aid for children. The good news is you can buy your kid a Moonbuddy right now, with the device currently discounted to $110.42 as part of Moonbird&#39;s end of year sale. Unfortunately, when Engadget contacted the company to ask about its CES 2026, all it sent us back was a response from &#34;Luna,&#34; its automated AI agent. &#34;I don&#39;t have specific information about our CES 2026 exhibition plans to share with you right now,&#34; the bot told me, adding I should email the address I just emailed to get a response from a human being. OhSnap MCONEngadget senior reporter Jessica Conditt holds the OhSnap MCON in her hand at CES 2025. The attached phone displays Minecraft.Jess Conditt for EngadgetThe OhSnap MCON won us over with its simple pitch: it basically had the ability to turn any smartphone into a Xperia Play. Actually accomplishing that feat was more complicated, with components like Hall effect joysticks for added durability increasing the time it took for OhSnap to get the product ready. For that reason, the MCON didn&#39;t make it out to consumers in 2025. However, you can preorder one now for about $210, with shipments slated to start this year.  Roborock Saros Z70The Roborock Saros Z70 uses its robotic arm to put a handful of socks into a basket. Karissa Bell for EngadgetThe Saros Z70 was one of a handful of robot vacuums that debuted at CES 2025 with a built-in extendable arm, but Roborock&#39;s flagship was the one that made the best impression. We didn&#39;t end up recommending it in our robot vacuum guide; there are more affordable options that will appeal to a greater number of people. But if you want the latest and greatest, the Saros Z70 is on sale right now for $2,000.  Yukai Engineering MirumiA Mirumi robot sticks to a pink purse. Cheyenne MacDonald for EngadgetOf all the gadgets Engadget saw at CES 2025, it&#39;s fair to say the Mirumi robot from Yukai Engineering was the only one to steal our hearts. All this cute little charm does is stare at you and move its head around a little until you’ve been tricked into a few moments of happiness, and honestly that was more than enough for us to award it a best of CES award. Right now, you can find Yukai Engineering accepting pre-orders for Mirumi through Kickstarter. The project, which began at the start of December, easily surged past its modest $4,878 goal, raising $267,170 as of the writing of this article. The campaign ends on January 22, so you still have time to secure your Mirumi preorder. Technics EAH-AZ100 earbudsA pair of Technics AZ100 earbuds sit on a wooden desk, with an iPhone and a pair of books next to them. Billy Steele for EngadgetThey might have only been a pair of earbuds, but a lot of us left CES really excited about the Technics EAH-AZ100. The reason for that was that they were the debut of the company&#39;s new magnetic fluid drivers technology, which promised to deliver even more clarity, detail and bass than the drivers in Technics&#39; already excellent AZ80 earbuds. When Engadget&#39;s resident audio guru Billy Steele got a chance to review the EAH-AZ100 a couple of months later, he gave them a score of 85, saying they offered &#34;some of the best sound quality in any of the hundreds of earbuds I’ve tested over the years.&#34; Urtopia Titanium ZeroThe Titanium Zero sits at a CES display with other e-bikes nearby.Daniel Cooper for EngadgetAs a cyclist, the Urtopia Titanium Zero was the one product I left CES 2025 excited to see in the real world. If a titanium bike wasn&#39;t cool enough already, the Zero&#39;s Quark DM1.2 motor offered something actually innovative: a mid-drive motor with more power output than even the best hub motor. Unfortunately, while you can buy plenty of other e-bikes off of Urtopia&#39;s website, the Titanium Zero isn&#39;t on sale yet. That said, the company plans to showcase the bike, alongside the Quark DM1.2, at CES 2026.  WeWalk Smart Cane 2A person uses the Wewalk Smart Cane 2 to find their way through a CES booth. Cheyenne MacDonald for EngadgetThe WeWalk Smart Cane 2 won two awards from Engadget during CES 2025, including our coveted best in show nod. At an event where nearly every manufacturer found a way to add AI to their devices, the Smart Cane 2 appealed to us for its thoughtful use of the tech. It offers turn-by-turn navigation and obstacle detection, in addition to a GPT-powered voice assistant to give users a way to access information without also having to juggle their phone at the same time. If you visit WeWalk&#39;s website today, there&#39;s a &#34;buy now&#34; link for the Smart Cane 2 that leads to a dead end. When Engadget reached out to WeWalk, the company said it would be once again at CES demoing the Smart Cane 2.    This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/where-are-engadgets-ces-2025-winners-now-194500216.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2F2026-01%2F9dfbcf25-2fe9-4844-902e-e7e5c6b34fdd&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=c336f8b084490705321228f5dc6f3ef4718a4248,https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/where-are-engadgets-ces-2025-winners-now-194500216.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2026-01-02T19:45:00Z,10,Tech
GE's new Smart Refrigerator automates grocery shopping with a barcode scanner and Instacart,"Smart fridges are a dime a dozen at CES, and LG and Samsung have thoroughly explored what&#39;s possible when you connect your fridge to the internet or slap a touchscreen on the front. The new GE Profile Smart Refrigerator with Kitchen Assistant GE is announcing ahead of CES 2026 doesn&#39;t reinvent the wheel in that regard, but it does include a first: a built-in barcode scanner for adding items to your shopping list.GE&#39;s &#34;Scan-to-List&#34; feature uses the barcode scanner to quickly (and precisely) add items to a shareable shopping list in GE&#39;s SmartHQ app. You can refer to that list while you&#39;re shopping in person, or sync it  with Instacart and have it delivered, eliminating the need to go grocery shopping entirely. Inside the fridge, GE also includes a flush-mount LED bar with a built-in camera that can deliver &#34;real-time, on-demand snapshots of crisper drawers, focusing on the most costly and perishable items.&#34; This &#34;FridgeFocus&#34; feature is supposed to prevent you from overbuying perishable produce that you might already have, by letting you see which perishables might go bad first.GE&#39;s fridge is stainless steel and has a built-in touchscreen display.GEOn top of those smart features, the GE Profile Smart Refrigerator has a four-door stainless steel design, with door-in-door storage and an adjustable temperature drawer. The fridge also has an 8-inch touchscreen display for viewing recipes or the current weather conditions, and microphones for accepting voice commands. When you&#39;re dispensing water, the fridge&#39;s water dispenser is supposed to be smart enough to fill a container with the exact right amount of water using built-in sensors, too.The GE Profile Smart Refrigerator with Kitchen Assistant will be available from GE and select retailers starting in April 2026 for a suggested MSRP of $4,899.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/kitchen-tech/ges-new-smart-refrigerator-automates-grocery-shopping-with-a-barcode-scanner-and-instacart-194326610.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2FGE-Profile-Smart-Refrigerator.jpg&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=40ac12eac56c99f0dff2ab358337fb3bcde66b6c,https://www.engadget.com/home/kitchen-tech/ges-new-smart-refrigerator-automates-grocery-shopping-with-a-barcode-scanner-and-instacart-194326610.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2026-01-02T19:43:26Z,7,Tech
How to watch the LG press conference at CES 2026,"LG
For years, LG has opened CES press day with the first event of the morning — and 2026 will be no exception. The Korea-based corporation is theming this year&#39;s presentation as &#34;Innovation in Tune with You,&#34; and — if past shows are any indication — it will highlight both the consumer electronics and large appliance sides of its mammoth global businesses.
As with many tech-focused events nowadays, AI is expected to serve as the unifying thread of LG&#39;s CES 2026 presentation. That said, LG — much like Apple — has its own take on the acronym, referring to it as &#34;Affectionate Intelligence.&#34; The company will share &#34;its vision for elevating daily life through Affectionate Intelligence — delivering harmonized and seamlessly connected customer experiences.&#34; In other words, the company is aiming for its devices to become more connected and self-automated than ever. Here&#39;s how you can stream it and what you can expect.
How to watch LG&#39;s CES 2026 presentation
The event will stream live from Las Vegas on Monday, January 5 at 11AM ET. You&#39;ve got a few options for tuning in — watch the livestream on the LG website, the LG Global X channel or the LG Global YouTube channel (embedded below).

What to expect
Here&#39;s what LG has already confirmed it will be showcasing at CES 2026: 

LG will debut its first Micro RGB TV, a display with a cutting-edge screen technology with multicolor backlights that should one-up mini LED displays. The size options are 100 inches, 86 inches and 75 inches.
The company is countering Samsung&#39;s Frame TVs with its new LG Gallery TV, arriving in 55- and 65-inch screen sizes.
Look for a new LG humanoid home automation robot named CLOiD to take the stage. 
In the audio realm, the Korean multinational will also introduce a Dolby-powered modular home audio system and a new line of its xboom speakers (developed with musician will.i.am). 

Does that leave any surprises for the CES press conference? We&#39;ll find out on January 5.

How to watch the AMD CES 2026 keynote live,"AMD is kicking off CES 2026 on Monday, where it&#39;ll cover its latest AI developments and perhaps show off its newest Ryzen chips. The company will outline the full scope of its vision for AI implementations from across the full spectrum of consumer and enterprise applications. The presentation — which is the lead keynote for CES 2026 — will be led by CEO Dr. Lisa Su.
We&#39;ll tell you how to tune in to the livestream and what else you can expect to see.
How to watch AMD&#39;s keynote live
Dr. Su will deliver a keynote speech from the Palazzo Ballroom at the Venetian on Monday, January 5 at 9:30PM ET (6:30PM PT). You can watch the event live on the CES YouTube channel (we&#39;ve embedded the livestream below).

What to expect
While AMD says it&#39;s keeping its product details under wraps, we can expect &#34;updates on AI solutions, from cloud to enterprise, edge and devices.&#34;
It&#39;s also likely that AMD will unveil its new versions of the Ryzen chips during its keynote on Monday, as Su will talk about the &#34;advancements driven by Ryzen CPUs.&#34; That could include the Ryzen 7 9850X3D, which is expected to have better single-threaded performance. Additionally, we can expect to see the Ryzen 9000G series, which is potentially built with AMD&#39;s Zen 5 architecture.
Regarding AI, AMD could further discuss its new FSR Redstone technology, which it previously previewed on December 10. AMD&#39;s upscaling tech aims to close the gap on NVIDIA&#39;s DLSS 4, which was announced during CES 2025.
Su&#39;s presentation caps off CES&#39;s press day, so she&#39;ll be taking the stage in the hours after rivals NVIDIA and Intel present their chipmaking and AI bona plans to the world.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/how-to-watch-the-amd-ces-2026-keynote-live-190012078.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2026-01%2F57abd4f0-e7f8-11f0-bcff-8102a1b62603&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=e4d6fe5d37b50b4f4f9fb91fffe7046689f60bcc,https://www.engadget.com/computing/how-to-watch-the-amd-ces-2026-keynote-live-190012078.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2026-01-02T19:00:12Z,12,Tech
Amazon's base Kindle is $20 off right now,"The latest entry-level Kindle ereader is on sale for $90 via Amazon. This is a nice discount of $20. It&#39;s not a record-low price, but it&#39;s certainly a budget-friendly way to keep that New Year&#39;s resolution to read more. 
This made our list of the best ereaders, and for good reason. It&#39;s an iconic device that gets the job done. It doesn&#39;t have much by way of modern bells and whistles, but it ships with 16GB of storage and comes in two snazzy colorways. 

  
The build is compact and durable. It&#39;s also light, which makes it easy to pack and easy to hold up with one hand. It allows access to the vast Kindle library and this deal comes with three months of Kindle Unlimited. That&#39;s sort of like Netflix, but for books. The selection isn&#39;t comprehensive, but I&#39;ve always found something to read when in a pinch. 
This is an entry-level device. There&#39;s no color screen and no option to use a stylus. The battery, however, does last around six weeks with regular use. This is a metric I can personally confirm. It seems like I barely charge mine and it&#39;s always ready to go. 
The only major downside here is that this is one of those Amazon devices that forces ads on you. There is a version without lockscreen ads, but it costs more. I never really found them to be all that intrusive, given that they are tethered to the lockscreen and mostly advertise books.

Clicks is bringing its first smartphone and a new keyboard to CES 2026,"Clicks is bringing its physical keyboard products to CES yet again, and these are chock full of nostalgia. The company has also unveiled its first smartphone, aimed at &#34;communication, not consumption,&#34; that it says will function as a second phone used mostly for messaging.
The phone is dubbed the Clicks Communicator and features a tactile keyboard, a 4-inch OLED display, a 3.5mm headphone jack and expandable microSD storage up to 2TB. The interface is built on Android 16 and supports hardware-level encryption.
Even though Clicks says it wants to leave &#34;content capture&#34; to a users&#39; primary device, the Communicator still sports a 50MP main camera and 24MP front camera. The phone also has NFC to support Google Pay, along with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi capability. Its 4,000 mAh battery can be charged via USB-C or wireless charging.
While the Communicator may look like a Blackberry or Palm device from days gone by, it carries modern features like a fingerprint sensor in the spacebar. It also has what Clicks calls a Signal LED, which is a customizable alert light that lets users know when specific people or apps are causing notifications.
As much as Clicks talks about its new phone as a secondary device, it follows the trend of minimalist or &#34;dumb&#34; phones as more users pull away from an overexposure to technology, social media and notifications. Some might even find it compelling as a primary device. But the secondary device idea feels unproven: having two phones would mean two phone plans with two phone numbers, which could be impractical for many users. The Communicator can be reserved now for $399 and will increase to $499 on February 27.
For users wanting a tactile keyboard to use with standard smartphones, Clicks has made the Power Keyboard. It features a QWERTY layout with directional keys and a number row. It attaches via MagSafe or Qi2 and has a 2,150 mAh battery to help keep your phone topped up. The phone can then be flipped into either a horizontal or vertical orientation, which ends up resembling a T-Mobile Sidekick.
Clicks
The keyboard is compatible with both iOS and Android and since it pairs via Bluetooth, it can also be used with tablets, smart TVs and virtual reality headsets. Pre-orders for the Power Keyboard will open January 2 and an actual launch is expected in the spring. The keyboard will retail for $110, though early-bird pricing is available for $80.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/clicks-is-bringing-its-first-smartphone-and-a-new-keyboard-to-ces-2026-182239003.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2026-01%2F2cb07e10-e805-11f0-b7ee-673880650f7d&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=0f21fd996cee24843dd877dd82ebfffeb6981c50,https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/clicks-is-bringing-its-first-smartphone-and-a-new-keyboard-to-ces-2026-182239003.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2026-01-02T18:22:40Z,8,Tech
How to watch the Hisense CES 2026 presentation live,"Xinhua News Agency via Getty Images
Hisense is typically best known for its affordable electronics and home appliances, from TVs to refrigerators. But at CES 2025, the China-based company showed off its premium side with a massive 136-inch micro LED TV — now available for a jaw-dropping $100,000. So what&#39;s in store for this year&#39;s show? New leadership, for starters.
The company has two new hires, including Chief Marketing Officer Sarah Larsen and Chief Commercial Officer James Fishler. In a press release, Hisense said Fishler&#39;s experience in home entertainment, appliances and HVAC is important as the company &#34;builds toward a milestone 2026 and its presence at CES.&#34;
We&#39;ll give you a rundown of what to expect during Hisense&#39;s presentation and how you can watch it live.
How to watch Hisense&#39;s presentation
Hisense will have a livestream available on Monday, January 5 at 1PM ET on its website. We&#39;ll embed the link here once it&#39;s available.
What to expect
With its new hires in place, Hisense is clearly aiming to further polish its brand. Between Fishler and Larsen, the new front office is bringing to bear their experience from such high-powered competitors as LG, Samsung and Beats. And in a recent interview with Tom&#39;s Guide, Larsen emphasized a continued focus on the company&#39;s fast turnaround time from concept to market as a key differentiator for Hisense.
As for actual announcements, while you can expect Hisense to tout its strength in appliances and HVAC systems (really), Larsen&#39;s aforementioned interview specifically calls out the emerging RGB TV space as a focus. We expect this year&#39;s show will be all about explaining the shades of difference between mini and micro LED display technologies, as both Samsung and LG have already thrown down pre-announcement gauntlets on the latter. Will any of them cost less than six figures? Let&#39;s hope Hisense has some good news to share on that front.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/how-to-watch-the-hisense-ces-2026-presentation-live-jan-5-190040858.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F96e08150-dcf1-11f0-bb9f-44716a4663a2&resize=1400%2C931&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=9604d14ed9ca113312b470aa2f2c0235988a2cad,https://www.engadget.com/home/how-to-watch-the-hisense-ces-2026-presentation-live-jan-5-190040858.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2026-01-02T18:15:35Z,8,Tech

How to watch the first-ever Lego CES 2026 press conference live,"picture alliance via Getty Images
The Lego Group is set to host its very first press conference at CES 2026 — but exactly what it plans to unveil is still under wraps. The iconic toy brick maker has offered no clues about what&#39;s on the agenda, leaving speculation wide open, from new video games to Formula 1 race cars.
Here&#39;s how you can watch Lego&#39;s presentation at CES, along with what we think the company could reveal.
How to watch The Lego Group&#39;s CES 2026 press conference
The Lego CES press conference is scheduled for Monday, January 5 at 1PM ET. While Lego and the Consumer Technology Association haven&#39;t yet provided the details, we expect that the press conference will be available as a livestream. Once the details are confirmed, we&#39;ll update this post to confirm them. But if a livestream isn&#39;t immediately available, the Engadget team will be liveblogging the Lego presser and posting timely details.
What to expect
Thus far, Lego hasn&#39;t shared any public info about its CES plans, so we&#39;re largely in the dark as to what to expect. At CES 2025, for instance, the toy production giant partnered with Sony to announce the animated Lego Horizon Adventures online game. As such, Lego may spend some time talking up its new 2026 game, Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight. The company may also give some stage time to its Lego Group F1 Academy racing car, though that too would be more about brand building than consumer products.
And given Lego&#39;s focus on the environment, the company may discuss its efforts to reach its 2032 ecological goals, including making its Lego bricks more sustainable and reducing carbon emissions by 37%.
While there are plenty of new Lego sets for 2026, however, this is CES, not Toy Fair. So we&#39;re assuming that the company will be showcasing something that&#39;s more tech-centric. Stay tuned.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/how-to-watch-the-first-ever-lego-ces-2026-press-conference-live-monday-130005336.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2Fced0c170-dd13-11f0-b394-1dea3c7b6af3&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=86159cb528f5036b9bd7c790e666f19ff864d7ec,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/how-to-watch-the-first-ever-lego-ces-2026-press-conference-live-monday-130005336.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2026-01-02T17:46:27Z,8,Tech

LG made up a new word for its next ultralight Gram laptops: 'Aerominum',"LG just announced some new Gram AI laptops ahead of CES 2026. These are incredibly portable laptops that the company says are the &#34;lightest in their class.&#34; This is largely thanks to a proprietary material that LG has dubbed Aerominum.
This material reportedly &#34;reduces the laptop&#39;s weight while reinforcing&#34; structural strength. In other words, these computers are both light and durable. Each model offers improved scratch resistance, while providing a &#34;sleek metallic finish.&#34; The laptops have also been designed to meet military-grade durability standards.
The AI in the name refers to the inclusion of Microsoft Copilot+ PC and LG&#39;s on-device system. The laptops should be able to handle some AI tasks without an active internet connection.
These computers can also access LG&#39;s Link technology, which allows file sharing and screen mirroring across multiple devices. This works with smartphones, webOS devices, TVs, monitors and projectors.
There are two new laptops in the refreshed line. The LG gram Pro 17 boasts a 17-inch WQXGA LCD screen. It also comes with the latest NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5050 GPU. This is being called the &#34;world&#39;s lightest 17-inch laptop.&#34; The LG gram Pro 16 features an OLED display and is powered by the latest Intel Core Ultra processors.
We don&#39;t have pricing or availability yet on these. We&#39;ll update this post when we find out. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/lg-made-up-a-new-word-for-its-next-ultralight-gram-laptops-aerominum-172323577.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2026-01%2F451bfe50-e7fd-11f0-bff9-34eb3fede513&resize=1400%2C992&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=270fd006ef3525ba48513ad24afe2228b3914ab0,https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/lg-made-up-a-new-word-for-its-next-ultralight-gram-laptops-aerominum-172323577.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2026-01-02T17:23:23Z,8,Tech
How to watch the NVIDIA CES 2026 presentation live,"CFOTO via Getty Images
During CES 2025, NVIDIA spent much of its keynote touting its leading position in artificial intelligence. Still, the company managed to squeeze in a few notable hardware announcements, including its RTX 5000-series GPUs and Project Digits desktop supercomputer (later redubbed Spark). For this year&#39;s show, the company&#39;s website says it&#39;s &#34;lighting up CES 2026 with the power of AI.&#34; To that end, NVIDIA is going big in Las Vegas, promising hands-on demos in its Fontainebleau booth, replete with the &#34;latest NVIDIA solutions driving innovation and productivity across industries.&#34;
But if you won&#39;t be in Vegas for the action, don&#39;t worry. Here&#39;s how you can watch the livestream of the company&#39;s January 5 press conference, and what NVIDIA is expected to unveil at CES this year.
How to watch the NVIDIA CES 2026 keynote
NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang will deliver a 90-minute keynote at CES 2026. The event will be livestreamed on Monday, January 5 at 4PM ET via NVIDIA&#39;s website (and likely on YouTube as well). We&#39;ll embed the link here once it&#39;s available.
What to expect
NVIDIA&#39;s game plan for CES is suitably vague so far, including  &#34;cutting-edge AI, robotics, simulation, gaming and content creation at the NVIDIA Showcase.&#34; It also notes there will be more than 20 demos. Although we&#39;re unsure if all of these will be shown during the keynote, we can at least expect to see them throughout the week of CES.
Given NVIDIA&#39;s sky-high valuation and the fact that the health of the US and global economy seems increasingly linked to infrastructure spending on AI data centers — largely powered by chips from NVIDIA and its competitors — expect Huang&#39;s remarks to be as closely followed by Wall Street investors as technology acolytes, if not more so. Will we get any insight on a successor to the company&#39;s Blackwell chip? A more detailed look at how NVIDIA&#39;s partners are applying AI to real-world robotics? Time will tell, but you might want to keep your stock portfolio in a split screen while taking in Huang&#39;s presentation.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/how-to-watch-the-nvidia-ces-2026-press-conference-live-jan-5-130028279.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2Fb0333b00-dcee-11f0-a993-97c527ebca4b&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=f34aa0a1c841922ff87c5e64b793c7359f363f01,https://www.engadget.com/computing/how-to-watch-the-nvidia-ces-2026-press-conference-live-jan-5-130028279.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2026-01-02T17:15:37Z,21,Tech

Sony&#39;s CES 2026 press conference is just a few days away, and this year comes with a twist: Rather than an overview of Sony&#39;s electronics, video game and Hollywood studio plans for the new year, the presser will have a more narrow focus: electric vehicles. Sound odd? That&#39;s because the traditional end-of-press-day slot isn&#39;t just Sony, but rather Sony Honda Mobility — the joint venture responsible for the Afeela 1 electric car that has been showcased at CES for the better part of a decade. But this year, we&#39;ll get to see an all-new concept model at the event. 
How to watch the Sony Afeela CES 2026 press conference
The event will be streamed live from Las Vegas on Monday, January 5 at 8PM ET via the Afeela official YouTube channel. (We&#39;ll embed the stream here once it appears on the channel.)
What to expect from Sony Afeela at CES
What&#39;s now the Afeela 1 has been shown in various incarnations since CES 2020, where it was originally announced as Vision-S. But so many more important details were confirmed in the past couple of years, including the price, which starts at a staggering $89,900. However, the earlier impressions were less than impressive, and as of CES 2025, that thought remains the same. Engadget&#39;s automotive expert Tim Stevens said earlier this year that the EV &#34;feels like a PlayStation 4 in the PS5 era,&#34; and that &#34;the car lost what little interesting styling it had while sticking true to some specifications that sounded good five years ago.&#34; Ouch. 
But the Afeela 1 won&#39;t be the only vehicle on display. Its CES booth will showcase &#34;several Afeela 1 pre-production vehicles in multiple color variations, alongside a new Afeela concept model,&#34; Sony Honda Mobility said in a press release.
The company recently announced that the Afeela will be the first vehicle ever to offer PlayStation Remote Play, which lets players stream their PS4 or PS5 games from their consoles remotely while inside the car. 
We&#39;re hoping to hear about what else is new and improved at CES 2026, and we&#39;re also excited to see its newest concept model. And between booth displays and press releases, we&#39;re hoping we&#39;ll get to see at least a few new Sony Electronics products on the docket for 2026, too.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/how-to-watch-the-sony-honda-afeela-ces-2026-press-conference-monday-130048051.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F3f099890-d9ef-11f0-a3f3-bb8a02df8254&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=79186135ced099dc039e40ac5680ec450d04f68c,https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/how-to-watch-the-sony-honda-afeela-ces-2026-press-conference-monday-130048051.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2026-01-02T16:30:37Z,7,Tech

Pebble brings its round-faced smartwatch back from the dead,"
You’ve probably heard people say it’s impossible to go back and correct some error from the past. To those people, you should raise a middle finger in defiance (they are miserable, after all, and then point them to the tale of Pebble’s unlikely revival. The smartwatch pioneer’s return was a surprise of 2025, and now the company has resurrected one of its last great triumphs. It’s announcing the Pebble Round 2, and company founder Eric Migicovsky is looking to put right what once went wrong.
The Pebble Round 2 is the successor to the Pebble Time Round, which debuted in 2015 to what can only be described as frustrated reviews. It was a truly thin smartwatch, with a glorious round display, but that came at the cost of battery life and durability. The fancier components also added to the cost which pushed it to an unreasonable-for-the-time $249. It’s these flaws which the company has sought to address with the Round 2, as well as some of the issues that weren’t deal breakers at the time, but certainly weren’t ideal. 
For instance, the massive bezel around the display is now a thing of the past, with the Round 2’s 1.3-inch color e-paper touchscreen now stretching to the edge of its case. The viewing angles have also been dramatically improved, enabling you to check the time without having to move your wrist. The display has also been bonded to the glass crystal, reducing reflectivity and glare which was another downside for the original model. 
Better still, the battery life is now more than two weeks on a single charge, giving it the sort of Pebble-esque longevity its users demand. And it’s retained that thinness — measuring in at just 8.1mm — which is far more elegant than the chunkier smartwatches from other manufacturers. Plus, there’s dual microphones for interacting with AI agents and dictating messages, as well as step and sleep tracking.
Migicovsky explained that the focus here isn’t just to correct some of the more glaring issues from the first model. As he wrote back in 2022, Pebble’s failure was down to its attempt to broaden its appeal beyond the users who had so warmly adopted it in the first place. Consequently, rather than include bulky features like a a built-in optical heart-rate sensor, the focus is on utility. Not to mention a desire to reintroduce some much-needed whimsy into hardware, and empowering users to tinker with their devices, enabling them to craft their own watch faces.
Hopefully, we’ll get some time in person with the Pebble Round 2 in the next few days, but in the meantime, it’s up for pre-order from today. It’ll set you back $199, and will begin shipping in May. And if you’ve already put down cash for a Pebble Time 2, and want to change your mind, you can switch your order over, no questions asked.

Elon Musk's Grok AI posted CSAM image following safeguard 'lapses',"Elon Musk&#39;s Grok AI has been allowing users to transform photographs of woman and children into sexualized and compromising images, Bloomberg reported. The issue has created an uproar among users on X and prompted an &#34;apology&#34; from the bot itself. &#34;I deeply regret an incident on Dec. 28, 2025, where I generated and shared an AI image of two young girls (estimated ages 12-16) in sexualized attire based on a user&#39;s prompt,&#34; Grok said in a post. An X representative has yet to comment on the matter.
According to the Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network, CSAM includes &#34;AI-generated content that makes it look like a child is being abused,&#34; as well as &#34;any content that sexualizes or exploits a child for the viewer’s benefit.&#34;
Several days ago, users noticed others on the site asking Grok to digitally manipulate photos of women and children into sexualized and abusive content, according to CNBC. The images were then distributed on X and other sites without consent, in possible violation of law. &#34;We&#39;ve identified lapses in safeguards and are urgently fixing them,&#34; a response from Grok reads. It added that CSAM is &#34;illegal and prohibited.&#34; Grok is supposed to have features to prevent such abuse, but AI guardrails can often be manipulated by users.
It appears X has yet to reinforced whatever guardrails Grok has to prevent this sort of image generation. However, the company has hidden Grok&#39;s media feature which makes it harder to either find images or document potential abuse. Grok itself acknowledged that &#34;a company could face criminal or civil penalties if it knowingly facilitates or fails to prevent AI-generated CSAM after being alerted.&#34; 
The Internet Watch Foundation recently revealed that AI-generated CSAM has increased by an increase orders of magnitude in 2025 compared to the year before. This is in part because the language models behind AI generation are accidentally trained on real photos of children scraped from school websites and social media or even prior CSAM content.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/elon-musks-grok-ai-posted-csam-image-following-safeguard-lapses-140521454.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2026-01%2F90df29c0-e7d5-11f0-b5b7-eb3ee38b21a4&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=b6189285b3b4c2a38d6e85f77dcb18a6694458bb,https://www.engadget.com/ai/elon-musks-grok-ai-posted-csam-image-following-safeguard-lapses-140521454.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2026-01-02T14:05:21Z,7,Tech

Fender Audio will introduce a new line of Bluetooth speakers and headphones at CES,"Fender Audio, the consumer electronics arm of the instrument maker, will introduce two flagship audio products at this year&#39;s CES in Las Vegas. These products were made under a licensing agreement with Singapore-based company RiffSound.
First up is a line of Bluetooth speakers dubbed the ELIE (Extremely Loud Infinitely Expressive). The lineup includes two models, the E6 and E12. The speakers leverage a combination of DSP and system-on-a-chip processing, which Fender says can deliver more volume while maintaining greater power efficiency.
Each speaker can handle up to four audio channels at once, including a Bluetooth source, a wired XLR or 1/4-inch input and two additional wireless channels with compatible Fender Audio accessories. Users can also sync up two ELIE speakers in a stereo set-up. The announcement was light on specific differences between the E6 and E12, but in images shared with Engadget, the E12 appears larger. We&#39;ll be seeing these in person at CES for a more thorough evaluation.
Fender will also introduce the MIX headphones, a set of modular cans that the company says are designed to adapt to a user&#39;s sound and style preferences. The headphones include a USB-C transmitter that offers lossless, low-latency and Auracast transmission modes.
The headphones are powered by 40mm graphene drivers and feature active noise cancellation. They work in wired or wireless mode, with up to 100 hours of battery life, according to Fender. The company hasn&#39;t shared much about the modular aspect of these headphones, but we&#39;ll get a closer look at CES. Details on pricing and availability have not been shared.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/fender-audio-will-introduce-a-new-line-of-bluetooth-speakers-and-headphones-at-ces-130041696.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2Fcfb10100-e663-11f0-873f-effcce8c1045&resize=1400%2C990&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=17d892a4c59b67a708f02a1c58e14ba07a71d721,https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/fender-audio-will-introduce-a-new-line-of-bluetooth-speakers-and-headphones-at-ces-130041696.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2026-01-02T13:00:41Z,7,Tech
How to watch Lenovo's Tech World event at CES 2026,"It&#39;s been known for months now that technology giant Lenovo is hosting its Tech World event at Sphere in Las Vegas during CES week. Like many other tech conglomerates, the world&#39;s largest PC manufacturer by units shipped will put its main focus on AI. Lenovo says it&#39;s a &#34;Tech World experience unlike anything CES has seen before.&#34; We&#39;ll tell you where to livestream the event and what to expect so far.
How to watch the Lenovo CES 2026 event live
Lenovo CEO Yuanqing Yang will host the event on Tuesday, January 6 at 8PM ET. You can follow along to the livestream on YouTube once the event starts. (We&#39;ve embedded the code below.)

What to expect
Lenovo is using the high-profile Sphere venue to share some of its tie-ins to the sports world, offering an exclusive look at how the company&#39;s technology has &#34;revolutionized F1,&#34; Yang said in a press release. He&#39;ll also preview the plans for leveraging AI at this summer&#39;s FIFA World Cup, which takes place in the US.
After the event has wrapped up, pop singer Gwen Stefani will take the stage to perform.
As for real products, look for Lenovo to build on some of its successful launches from CES 2025. A year ago, we saw the portable Lenovo Legion Go S – the first third-party SteamOS handheld gaming device – as well as its &#34;stretchy&#34; laptop, the ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable that extends 2.7 inches taller with a touch of a button. To Lenovo&#39;s credit, both products were actually released and available for sale within months, unlike the vaporware that seems to comprise the bulk of many companies&#39; CES announcements.
Lastly, don&#39;t be surprised if we see some new Motorola smartphones, given that Lenovo is the parent company of the phone manufacturer. Maybe a new Razr foldable? We&#39;ll find out either way on Tuesday evening.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/how-to-watch-lenovos-tech-world-event-at-ces-2026-130004053.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F78ff54d0-e5c6-11f0-bbab-2fc5a780df54&resize=1400%2C894&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=c55f988495af0d68dffdd34aa319bc28f3ed4065,https://www.engadget.com/computing/how-to-watch-lenovos-tech-world-event-at-ces-2026-130004053.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2026-01-02T13:00:04Z,8,Tech

Two cybersecurity experts plead guilty to running ransomware operation,"
		
					  
						




Two cybersecurity professionals charged with running a ransomware operation have pleaded guilty to conspiring to obstruct, delay, or affect commerce through extortion.



They will be sentenced on March 12, 2026, the US Department of Justice announced this week.



Ryan Goldberg and Kevin Martin were charged with using the BlackCat ransomware against multiple victims in the US between April 2023 and December 2023. An unnamed co-consiprator was also listed in the court filings.



They were accused of targeting five companies with the ransomware: a Florida medical device company, a Maryland pharmaceutical company, a doctor’s office in California, an engineering company in California, and a drone manufacturer in Virginia.



BlackCat ransomware, also known as ALPHV, is particularly pernicious as it can exploit cloud copies of data intended to protect against ransomware attacks as a way into the enterprise. Those behind it are among the most dangerous ransomware groups active today.



Goldberg and Martin didn’t develop BlackCat, though: they identified victims and targeted them with the ransomware-as-a-service, sharing ransom payouts  with the developers.



The two reached plea agreements with the US Attorney for the Southern District of Florida on Dec. 18, 2025, and these were accepted by the US District Court for the Southern District fo Florida on Dec. 29, court records show.



The ransomware attacks resulted in losses exceeding $9.5 million, the parties agreed. However, authorities were only able to trace $324,123.26 in proceeds of the crimes to Goldberg and Martin, according to the plea agreements.



The pair face a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.



US authorities have been after them and the developers of the BlackCat software they used for years. The wider ransomware group is believed to have targeted more than 1,000 victims around the world, according to a DOJ news release.



The group was defanged in December 2023, when the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) developed a tool that could decrypt data held to ransom, according ot the DOJ. It estimated this saved hundreds of victims some $99 million in ransomware payments.

The Morning After: Instagram boss says ‘more practical to fingerprint real media than fake media’,"Instagram’s top exec Adam Mosseri expects AI content to overtake non-AI imagery and discussed the implications for the platform and users.
Mosseri shared his thoughts on broader trends he expects to shape Instagram in 2026. “Everything that made creators matter — the ability to be real, to connect, to have a voice that couldn’t be faked — is now suddenly accessible to anyone with the right tools,” he wrote. “The feeds are starting to fill up with synthetic everything.” He added: “There is already a growing number of people who believe, as I do, that it will be more practical to fingerprint real media than fake media.”
Mosseri doesn’t address the risk that this will alienate many photographers and other creators who have already grown frustrated with the app — it looks like Instagram is leaning into the AI firehose. And hey: whatever keeps its users using it.
Mosseri suggests many complaints stem from an outdated vision of what Instagram even is. The feed of “polished” square images, he says, “is dead.” Instead of trying to “make everyone look like a professional photographer,” Mosseri says that more “raw” and “unflattering” images will be how creators can prove they are real — not AI.
Or you could leave Instagram?

CES 2026: What to expect
First up, Samsung.
LG
CES kicks off this weekend. We’ve got a full preview that we’ll update in the run-up to the full show, but the major tech announcements will likely center on chips (ah, AI) and new TV tech (ah, CES). Intel is finally taking the wraps off its Panther Lake (Core Ultra Series 3) chips — the first to debut on the company’s 18A process. With a promised 50 percent performance boost, Intel needs to prove it can still compete with NVIDIA and AMD. Meanwhile, NVIDIA’s Jensen Huang will deliver a keynote at the Las Vegas show, while AMD’s Lisa Su teases Ryzen 9000-series refreshes and more.
This year’s TV obsession is Micro RGB. Samsung is going big — literally — with a Micro RGB lineup spanning 55 to 115 inches. LG, meanwhile, has its own Micro RGB Evo panels, boasting over a thousand dimming zones for that elusive “perfect” contrast. We’ll be on the ground in Vegas to separate the legitimate, exciting new tech from the marketing fluff and AI assistant tchotchkes. And remember me mentioning the celebrity CES parade? Well, will.i.am is back at CES, this time curiously involved with LG’s portable speakers. Check it off your CES bingo card.

The era of foldable handheld consoles is coming
OneXSugar Wallet has a 4:3 foldable screen and a terrible name.
OneXSugar
OneXPlayer is quickly establishing itself as a company unafraid to get weird as hell. (Take, for example, its pseudo-foldable dual-screen console). This time, while it initially appears to be another standard dual-screen model, the Android-powered OneXSugar Wallet instead uses a single foldable screen. The OneXSugar Wallet was teased in a 54-second video on the Chinese video-sharing platform Bilibili. Retro Handhelds reports the Wallet uses an 8.01-inch OLED with a 2,480 x 1,860 resolution. That’s a 4:3 aspect ratio when unfolded, making it very retro-gaming friendly.
Given the foldable screen tech, the price might not be. OneXSugar hasn’t shared that detail yet.

Minimal phone pioneer Punkt is back with a new privacy-focused model at CES,"The Swiss minimal phone pioneer Punkt is back with another model, the MC03. The new handset continues Punkt&#39;s focus on privacy, security and digital minimalism.If you&#39;ve never seen Punkt&#39;s MP01 and MP02, the company&#39;s gorgeously minimal dumb phone line, they&#39;re something to behold. (The MP01 is quite literally a museum piece, in New York’s Museum of Modern Art.) Meanwhile, this new MC03 is the company&#39;s second stab at a more practical touchscreen smartphone, following 2023’s MC02. What you lose in physical beauty and tactile buttons, you gain in flexibility.As before, the smartphone runs the privacy- and security-focused AphyOS, based on the Android Open Source Project (AOSP). The fork on the MC03 appears to borrow a page from the Light Phone line. Its UI includes a Light Phone-adjacent row of text for the most common shortcuts, like mail, contacts and calendar.Punkt MC03PunktThe MC03 splits data into two sections. There&#39;s The Vault, a secure enclave for apps Punkt has vetted for privacy and security. The second, Wild Web, gives you the freedom to install any Android app. To protect you while using that section, there&#39;s Ledger, which Punkt describes as &#34;strict, visible safeguards that allow easy privacy controls.&#34; Much like Android&#39;s Permission Manager, Ledger lets you define which data, sensors and background resources each app can access. In exchange for the tediousness of approving and denying permissions, you get more gradual control over your data.All the apps from another Swiss company, Proton, are available in The Vault. (That includes Proton Mail, Proton Calendar, Proton Drive, Proton VPN, and Proton Pass.) Proton founder and CEO Andy Yen said he hopes the collaboration can &#34;inject a little more choice into the marketplace, giving users more ways to take control of their data and regain their privacy.&#34;Folks buying the MC03 aren&#39;t doing so to get cutting-edge hardware. The phone has an OLED display with a high (120Hz) frame rate, great for showing off that clean, black UI. The MC03 has a removable 5,200mAh battery and a 64MP camera. The device is rated IP68 for water and dust resistance.Shipments for the Punkt MC03 begin this month in the European market. The phone costs €699 / CHF699 / £610. As with its previous models, the MC03 requires a subscription. (Punkt frames this as paying to retain your data, rather than paying with your data.) One year of the subscription is included with your purchase. After that, you&#39;ll have to pay €9.99 / CHF9.99 / £8.99 monthly. However, paying ahead for a long-term subscription lets you save up to 60 percent. You can learn more on the company’s website.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/minimal-phone-pioneer-punkt-is-back-with-a-new-privacy-focused-model-at-ces-110000705.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2Fpunkt_2.jpg&resize=1400%2C839&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=9eecc17deacb72f1ba3c8153b1a4ec68fb44ac3d,https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/minimal-phone-pioneer-punkt-is-back-with-a-new-privacy-focused-model-at-ces-110000705.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2026-01-02T11:00:00Z,8,Tech

The best rice cooker for 2026,"A great rice cooker can change the way you handle weeknight meals. Instead of watching the pot or dealing with uneven results, you get fluffy, consistent rice with almost no effort. Modern rice cookers can do a lot more than white rice, too. Many handle brown rice, oatmeal and grains, and some function like mini multi-cookers for soups or stews.With so many options available, the best rice cooker for you depends on how often you cook, how much counter space you have and which features matter most. We tested a range of models to find the best rice cookers for everything from small kitchens to big family dinners. 
Best rice cookers for 2026 

  

  

  

  
How we test rice cookers 
Since rice is a foundation for so many different cuisines, I placed a high value on a machine’s ability to cook different types of rice well. I started testing each electric rice cooker by making a Japanese style, sushi-grade white rice. The appliances that delivered tasty results moved on to the brown rice round, then the top performers made long-grain white basmati as a final challenge. Some models I tested included a steamer basket, but I didn&#39;t try all of them out. This is a rice-only party. Multi-cookers and steaming functions are merely a nice bonus in these, although if that&#39;s a feature you want, an instant pot might be more your jam. 
While I weighed rice tastiness and texture as the most important criteria, I also assessed how easy the machines were to use and to clean. That includes things like how intuitive the cooking functions are, whether the inner pot is nonstick and how well the keep warm setting performs. I also took note of helpful kitchen tools that came included like a measuring cup, which is essential when getting the amount of water just right for each cup of rice. Because a cool piece of gear that sits in your cabinet gathering dust is a cool, but ultimately useless piece of gear. I limited my testing to models retailing for less than $300, which felt like the most I could recommend investing in a specialized appliance, and value for cost wound up being the distinguishing point for a good rice cooker.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/kitchen-tech/best-rice-cooker-120015478.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F9ecd2bc0-d44a-11f0-bfff-7f3af843641f&resize=1400%2C840&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=4ddc7456c9d1c5fea429ee6012a4b2adaa7d098c,https://www.engadget.com/home/kitchen-tech/best-rice-cooker-120015478.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2026-01-02T10:01:27Z,7,Tech

Cybersecurity skills matter more than headcount in the AI era,"
		
					  
						




Cybersecurity teams are navigating a shift as skills shortages overtake headcount as the primary concern, according to ISC2’s 2025 Cybersecurity Workforce Study. The research, based on responses from some 16,029 cybersecurity professionals globally, reveals that while budget cuts and layoffs have leveled off after last year’s surge, the pressure on security teams has intensified.



ISC2, a nonprofit member organization for cybersecurity professionals, found that cybersecurity workforce budget limitations remain a key driver of staff shortages, with 33% of respondents stating that their organizations do not have enough resources to “adequately” staff their teams. Another 29% of respondents said they cannot afford to hire staff with the skills they need to “adequately secure their organizations,” this year’s study found. And nearly three-fourths (72%) of respondents said that they believe reducing security personnel “significantly increases the risk of a breach in their organizations,” according to ISC2.



Economic conditions affecting cybersecurity budgets showed signs of stabilizing in 2025, according to ISC2, with reports of budget cuts dropping to 36% (down one percentage point from 2024) and layoffs declining to 24% (also down one point). Still, underlying workforce challenges remain.



“Based on what we’re seeing in the data and the sentiment of cybersecurity professionals globally, there is no indication that budget cuts or layoffs will accelerate significantly in 2026,” says Casey Marks, Chief Operating Officer at ISC2. “Economic conditions will always play an important role in workforce development and enablement. However, the overall outlook does not suggest a worsening trend in 2026.”



Skills gaps drive security consequences



The study highlights a critical trend: Nearly 90% of respondents (88%) have experienced at least one significant cybersecurity event in their organizations due to skills shortages, with 69% reporting more than one event. The severity of skills needs has grown substantially, with 95% of respondents reporting at least one skill need (up 5% from 2024) and 59% citing critical or significant skills gaps (a 15% increase from the previous year).



“A shift is happening. This year’s data makes it clear that the most pressing concern for cybersecurity teams isn’t headcount but skills,” said Debra Taylor, ISC2 Acting CEO and CFO, in a statement. “Skills deficits raise cybersecurity risk levels and challenge business resilience.”



Organizations have experienced oversights in cybersecurity processes and procedures (26%), been forced to put underqualified or inexperienced people into roles to cover them (25%), are lacking the time or resources to train cybersecurity staff (25%), and are dealing with misconfigured systems (24%), according to this year’s study. The report also states



“Another commonly cited (24%) outcome of skills shortages is that parts of the organization are left under-secured and staff are unable to take advantage of emerging cybersecurity technologies (24% each),” the report states.



While the study doesn’t tie security consequences to specific technical domains, the number of consequences shows how capability development has become more critical than simply adding headcount, Marks says.



“AI and cloud security continue to stand out as the most urgent skills needs from both hiring managers and cybersecurity professionals. Nearly everyone in the study reports at least one skills need, and most report significant ones,” Marks says. “That tells us capability development has become more critical than simply adding headcount.”



AI adoption accelerates



The research found that AI adoption is accelerating quickly, with 28% of respondents reporting that they have already integrated AI tools into their operations and 69% involved in some level of adoption, through integration, active testing, or early evaluation.



“What stands out is how fast AI has moved from experimentation into day-to-day operations. More than two-thirds of respondents are already using, testing, or actively evaluating AI tools in their security programs,” Marks explains. “For those who are using them today, the majority are already seeing measurable productivity gains. That tells us that AI is quickly becoming a practice part of how security work gets done, not a future concept.”



The study shows that cybersecurity professionals view AI technology as a career accelerator. The study found that 73% believe AI will create more specialized cybersecurity skills, 72% say it will necessitate more strategic cybersecurity mindsets, and 66% said they believe it will require broader skillsets across the workforce.



AI remains one of the top skills needed for the second consecutive year, with 41% of respondents of the 2025 study citing it as a critical skill, followed by cloud security at 36%. According to the report, 48% of respondents are already working to gain generalized AI knowledge and skills, while “35% are educating themselves on AI solutions at risk to better understand vulnerabilities and exploits.”



“The use of AI tools and the perception that AI will be a career-booster in the cybersecurity industry are prompting professionals to take proactive steps to develop and expand their knowledge and skill base to future-proof their careers,” Marks says. “They see it as a driver of new and more specialized skills, more strategic responsibilities, and broader career pathways.”



High cybersecurity job satisfaction



The research found that 87% believe there will always be a need for cybersecurity professionals, 81% are confident the profession will remain strong, and 68% are satisfied in their current job (up two percentage points from 2024). Another 80% report feeling passionate about their work.



“While satisfaction with organizations and leadership varies, confidence in the profession itself remains high, and that sense of purpose is a powerful stabilizing force. Cybersecurity is a mission-driven field, and 80% reported feeling passionate about their work, while 71% are satisfied with their day-to-day experience. A large majority believe the profession will remain essential in the long term and will continue to feel passionate about their role,” Marks says.



Almost half (48%) of respondents feel exhausted from trying to stay current on the latest cybersecurity threats and emerging technologies, and 47% feel overwhelmed by workload, according to the study. ISC2’s findings suggest that sustained investment in skills development—especially related to AI—realistic workload expectations, and support for continuous learning during working hours are essential. 



The study also found that career development is important to cybersecurity professionals. Nearly one-third (31%) of respondents said they consider advancement opportunities critical, and 23% cited unplanned financial or benefit rewards as key drivers. According to the 2025 study, 75% are likely to stay at their current organization for the next year, but that number drops to 66% when considering the next two years. The study’s findings proves that organizations must rethink their approach to cybersecurity workforce development, according to ISC2’s Marks.



“The data shows tremendous energy at the individual level around AI upskilling. Nearly half of respondents are already building AI skills on their own, and many plan to pursue AI-focused qualifications,” Marks says. “Organizations are investing in development through training budgets, internal education and cross-training, but the scale of demand for AI skills is significant. Our research shows widespread individual and organizational investment in AI upskilling, with demand continuing to grow.”

Starlink is lowering thousands of satellites' orbits to reduce risk of collisions,"Starlink will lower the orbits of roughly 4,400 satellites this year as a safety measure, according to engineering VP, Michael Nicolls. In a post on X, Nicolls wrote that the company is &#34;beginning a significant reconfiguration of its satellite constellation,&#34; in which all satellites orbiting at around 550 kilometers (342 miles) will be lowered to around 480 km (298 miles). The move is intended to reduce the risk of collisions, putting the satellites in a region that&#39;s less cluttered and will allow them to deorbit more quickly should an incident occur. &#34;Lowering the satellites results in condensing Starlink orbits, and will increase space safety in several ways,&#34; Nicolls wrote, also pointing to the coming solar minimum — a period in the sun&#39;s 11ish-year cycle when activity is lower — as one of the reasons for the move. The next solar minimum is expected to occur in the early 2030s. &#34;As solar minimum approaches, atmospheric density decreases which means the ballistic decay time at any given altitude increases - lowering will mean a &gt;80% reduction in ballistic decay time in solar minimum, or 4+ years reduced to a few months,&#34; Nicolls wrote.A screenshot of an X post by Starlink VP of engineering Michael Nicolls announcing that satellites orbiting at around 500 kilometers will be lowered to 480kmThe announcement comes a few weeks after Starlink said one of its satellites had experienced an anomaly that created some debris and sent it tumbling. Just a few days earlier, Nicolls posted about a close call with a batch of satellites he said were launched from China seemingly without any attempt to coordinate with operators of existing satellites in the space. With his latest announcement, Nicolls added that lowering Starlink&#39;s satellites &#34;will further improve the safety of the constellation, particularly with difficult to control risks such as uncoordinated maneuvers and launches by other satellite operators.&#34;This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/starlink-is-lowering-thousands-of-satellites-orbits-to-reduce-risk-of-collisions-030509067.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2F2026-01%2Fb4ebbace-5e38-4eb0-86a5-0534d5d65a6c&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=58bb10ced13154784afd2f75fad72eda94b625e6,https://www.engadget.com/science/space/starlink-is-lowering-thousands-of-satellites-orbits-to-reduce-risk-of-collisions-030509067.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2026-01-02T03:05:09Z,7,Tech
Samsung's latest Freestyle portable projector is  brighter and smarter,"Samsung has upgraded its Freestyle portable projector for 2026. The company announced a new model, the Freestyle+, ahead of CES, touting twice the brightness of its predecessor at 430 ISO lumens, and AI-powered screen optimization features. As with Freestyles past, the Freestyle+ offers 180-degree rotation and 360-degree audio. This one also supports Q-Symphony so it&#39;ll work with some Samsung soundbars. Samsung hasn&#39;t revealed much else in the way of specs or pricing, but it&#39;ll be showing off the Freestyle+ at CES 2026, so we&#39;re likely to learn more details soon. While previous iterations of Samsung&#39;s compact projector offered automatic screen adjustment features, like auto focus and auto leveling, the Freestyle+ uses AI to take optimization a step further. With AI OptiScreen, as the company is calling it, the projector offers 3D auto keystone to fix distortion on uneven or non-flat surfaces, real-time focus when the projector is moved, automatic screen fit for compatible accessories and wall calibration to reduce visual distractions from the projection surface. It&#39;ll also support Samsung&#39;s Vision AI Companion. The company hasn&#39;t announced a specific release date yet for the new projector, but says it&#39;s targeting the first half of the year. It&#39;ll be released in phases globally. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsungs-latest-freestyle-portable-projector-is-brighter-and-smarter-014026804.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2Ffreestyleplus.jpg&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=8d6d3283e49a6fc13ca9538e5c8c5106cd0e585c,https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsungs-latest-freestyle-portable-projector-is-brighter-and-smarter-014026804.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2026-01-02T01:40:26Z,7,Tech

How to watch Hyundai's CES 2026 presentation live,"A look at Hyundai&#39;s Holographic Windshield Display. (Hyundai)
While it often feels like a full-on auto show, the car vibes feel somewhat lessened at CES 2026. Yes, the Afeela electric vehicle from the Sony-Honda joint venture will be back on the floor, but with the Trump administration yanking most EV incentives from the market, the industry isn&#39;t offering a full-court press of new vehicles in Las Vegas this year. That said, there&#39;s still plenty of in-cabin car tech on display, including Hyundai&#39;s Holographic Windshield Display. 
Indeed, the company&#39;s Mobis subsidiary will present &#34;more than 30 mobility convergence technologies&#34; during CES. And we&#39;ll also get to see Hyundai&#39;s AI Robotics Strategy, which will showcase its new Atlas robot fresh out of the lab.
How to watch Hyundai&#39;s presentation at CES 2026
Hyundai&#39;s presentation takes place on January 5 at 4PM ET, and you can livestream it on either its HyundaiUSA YouTube channel or its global YouTube channel. We&#39;ll embed the stream here once it&#39;s available.
What to expect
As mentioned above, Hyundai will have its Holographic Windshield Display for viewing. It&#39;s essentially a next-gen heads-up display that projects key data from the vehicle&#39;s dash on the windshield for less distraction, and without obstructing the driver&#39;s view. It&#39;s a vertically expandable 18.1-inch large display, and passengers can even watch videos without being visible to the driver.
Hyundai Mobis collaborated with German optics specialist Zeiss to develop the &#34;world&#39;s first system to utilize holographic film to transform the entire front windshield into an ultra-large display surface.&#34; It says it will begin mass production in 2029, so don&#39;t expect to see this on the market anytime soon.
Beyond automotive, though, we&#39;ll also get a first-ever look at the company&#39;s new Atlas robot. In the teaser image shown in the press release, Atlas looks rather dog-like, which makes sense when you remember that Boston Dynamics was purchased by the Korean multinational back in 2020.
&#34;This next-generation Atlas represents a tangible step toward the commercialization of AI Robotics, highlighting the Group’s commitment to building safe and adaptable robotic co-workers,&#34; the company said in the same press release.
Hyundai said it will also discuss its other tech areas, including electronics and chassis system safety, as well as an AR head-up display, low-power display solutions and EV drive systems.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/how-to-watch-hyundais-ces-2026-presentation-live-190051181.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-08%2F45fa49c0-847b-11f0-9bf6-172608c15ed6&resize=1400%2C931&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=162677b4bab02fe3366d0e1b8b08aca43ab4bddd,https://www.engadget.com/transportation/how-to-watch-hyundais-ces-2026-presentation-live-190051181.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2026-01-01T19:00:51Z,10,Tech

How to watch the Hisense CES 2026 presentation live,"Xinhua News Agency via Getty Images
Hisense is generally best known for its budget-friendly electronics and appliances, like TVs and refrigerators. However, at CES 2025, the China-based company showcased its high-end capabilities with a massive 136-inch micro LED TV, which has recently become available for a staggering $100,000. So what&#39;s on deck for this year&#39;s show? New leadership, for starters.
The company has two new hires, including Chief Marketing Officer Sarah Larsen and Chief Commercial Officer James Fishler. In a press release, Hisense said Fishler&#39;s experience in home entertainment, appliances and HVAC is important as the company &#34;builds toward a milestone 2026 and its presence at CES.&#34;
We&#39;ll give you a rundown of what to expect during Hisense&#39;s presentation and how you can watch it live.
How to watch Hisense&#39;s presentation
Hisense will have a livestream available on Monday, January 5 at 1PM ET on its website. We&#39;ll embed the link here once it&#39;s available.
What to expect
With its new hires in place, Hisense is clearly aiming to further polish its brand. Between Fishler and Larsen, the new front office is bringing to bear their experience from such high-powered competitors as LG, Samsung and Beats. And in a recent interview with Tom&#39;s Guide, Larsen emphasized a continued focus on the company&#39;s fast turnaround time from concept to market as a key differentiator for Hisense.
As for actual announcements, while you can expect Hisense to tout its strength in appliances and HVAC systems (really), Larsen&#39;s aforementioned interview specifically calls out the emerging RGB TV space as a focus. We expect this year&#39;s show will be all about explaining the shades of difference between mini and micro LED display technologies, as both Samsung and LG have already thrown down pre-announcement gauntlets on the latter. Will any of them cost less than six figures? Let&#39;s hope Hisense has some good news to share on that front.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/how-to-watch-the-hisense-ces-2026-presentation-live-monday-190040380.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F96e08150-dcf1-11f0-bb9f-44716a4663a2&resize=1400%2C931&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=9604d14ed9ca113312b470aa2f2c0235988a2cad,https://www.engadget.com/home/how-to-watch-the-hisense-ces-2026-presentation-live-monday-190040380.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2026-01-01T18:01:26Z,8,Tech

Pick up a four-pack of AirTags for only $65 right now,"Most Apple products are pretty expensive, but some of the most affordable (and useful) ones are AirTags. The Bluetooth trackers are priced pretty reasonably even when not on sale, but they can be a steal if you can get them on a discount — like right now. A four pack of AirTags is on sale for $65 at Amazon, which is only a few dollars more than the record-low price we saw during Black Friday a couple of months ago. 

  
AirTags can be useful for people who travel frequently, helping you to keep track of essentials like your passport as well as a way to keep tabs on luggage while you&#39;re on the go. If you do purchase some AirTags, we have some recommendations for useful accessories to go along with them, such as different styles of cases to best attach the trackers to different types of items. These are worth looking over and adding to your shopping cart in order to make the most of the product.  
AirTags have an IP67 rating for water and dust resistance and their replaceable batteries should last for about a year. They can also support Precision Finding, which gives more exact directions to a lost item, when paired with most models after the iPhone 11. Up to five people can share an AirTag&#39;s location, which is helpful for families or large travel groups.  
If you really only need one AirTag, that configuration is also on sale at Amazon right now — it&#39;s 34 percent off and down to just $19 a pop.

Airloom will showcase its new approach to wind power at CES,"One of the many concerns about artificial intelligence these days is how the rush to build data centers is impacting local communities. Data centers can create a drain on resources, and some utility companies have already said customers can expect to see their electricity bills growing as these facilities increase demand. There have been some discussions of what other power sources could support the AI engine, and wind power specialist Airloom is one company that&#39;s looking to address the problem. Ahead of the business&#39; upcoming appearance at CES, we&#39;ve learned a bit about what Airloom has accomplished this year and what it is aiming for next.Rather than the very tall towers typically used for this approach, Airloom&#39;s structures are 20 to 30 meters high. They are comprised of a loop of adjustable wings that move along a track, a design that’s akin to a roller coaster. As the wings move, they generate power just like the blades on a regular wind turbine do. Airloom claims that its structures require 40 percent less mass than a traditional one while delivering the same output. It also says the Airloom&#39;s towers require 42 percent fewer parts and 96 percent fewer unique parts. In combination, the company says its approach is 85 percent faster to deploy and 47 percent less expensive than horizontal axis wind turbines. Airloom broke ground on a pilot site in June for testing out its approach and confirming how those figures work in practice. It’s not feasible to bring a wind farm, even a small one, into CES, but Airloom will have a booth at the event with materials about its technology and engineering. While the business isn&#39;t in a consumer-facing field, the impact of Airloom&#39;s work could have a future positive impact on people if the data center boom continues.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/airloom-will-showcase-its-new-approach-to-wind-power-at-ces-160000063.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2Fairloom_1.jpg&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=9713dbbd3b006de78d69480366fde0836a6369ba,https://www.engadget.com/science/airloom-will-showcase-its-new-approach-to-wind-power-at-ces-160000063.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2026-01-01T16:00:00Z,12,Tech

How to watch the NVIDIA CES 2026 presentation live,"CFOTO via Getty Images
During CES 2025, we watched NVIDIA tout its leading position in the artificial intelligence arena for the bulk of the presentation. But it did reveal some new hardware, including its RTX 5000-series GPUs and Project Digits desktop supercomputer (later redubbed Spark). This year, the company&#39;s website says it&#39;s &#34;lighting up CES 2026 with the power of AI.&#34; To that end, NVIDIA is pulling out all the stops at its Vegas installation, promising hands-on demos in its booth at the Fontainebleau, replete with the &#34;latest NVIDIA solutions driving innovation and productivity across industries.&#34;
But don&#39;t worry if you&#39;re not on the ground in Vegas. Here&#39;s how you can watch the livestream of the company&#39;s January 5 press conference, and what to expect from NVIDIA at CES this year.
How to watch the NVIDIA CES 2026 keynote
NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang will deliver a 90-minute keynote at CES 2026. The event will be livestreamed on January 5 at 4PM ET via NVIDIA&#39;s website (and likely on YouTube as well). We&#39;ll embed the link here once it&#39;s available.
What to expect
NVIDIA&#39;s game plan for CES is suitably vague so far, including  &#34;cutting-edge AI, robotics, simulation, gaming and content creation at the NVIDIA Showcase.&#34; It also notes there will be more than 20 demos. Although we&#39;re unsure if all of these will be shown during the keynote, we can at least expect to see them throughout the week of CES.
Given NVIDIA&#39;s sky-high valuation and the fact that the health of the US and global economy seems increasingly linked to infrastructure spending on AI data centers – largely powered by chips from NVIDIA and its competitors — expect Huang&#39;s remarks to be as closely followed by Wall Street investors as technology acolytes, if not more so. Will we get any insight on a successor to the company&#39;s Blackwell chip? A more detailed look at how NVIDIA&#39;s partners are applying AI to real-world robotics?

So in 2025, I tried to reverse years of studied avoidance towards the most ubiquitous technological phenomenon on earth —  I got back on social media. The change was short-lived. My first exodus from the feeds took some work — disabling notifications, removing apps from my homescreen and then deleting accounts entirely. This time, the phone put itself down. The whole thing has simply lost its luster.I started with Instagram. Every experience went like this: I’d see a single post from one of the rare family members or IRL friends who are active on the platform. Next, I was fed a sponsored post, followed by suggestions to follow randos. After that, a series of influencer videos that, admittedly, appeal to my taste (funny/absurdist women and dissertations on urban planning). That was followed up with more sponsored posts, mostly from brands I’d looked up for work. Then it’d circle back to the influencers. My eyes glazed over and I tossed the phone aside.  Years back, the platform gave off a jolt of quasi-social connection that I’d spend hours sucking up. I fed on pointless thoughts from an ex-coworker, vacation reels from a college roommate, a half-baked loaf of bread that an old friend dropped on the floor but took a picture of anyway. Now it’s a bare sliver of that stuff, shoehorned between towers of sponsored content and posts from people who make or promote their living on Instagram. The real people have left. The connection is gone. The FOMO is no more.   I experienced some variation of the same disappointment on every platform I rejoined. When I got back on TikTok a few months after the ban, it felt like a frenzied shopping mall. Every video seems to be about four seconds long and most are promotional and/or shoppable. YouTube Shorts is drowning in AI-generated videos, and I don’t hit up social media to watch fake footage of desperate wild animal babies clambering onto the boats of helpful humans. My life has no need for simulated toddlers admonishing their pets. Occasionally, I’d hit on something compelling: a clip from late night TV, a stupidly decadent dessert recipe, people from other countries explaining cultural subtleties. But for me, these social media platforms are no longer velcro for the eyes. I remember losing focus, spending long hours on YouTube Shorts and IG. I’d look up bleary-eyed and shame-faced after hours scrolling TikTok’s For You Page. Now, after a few minutes, a bored ickiness sets in. I feel like I’m trapped in a carnival of bots hawking shampoo at me and I just want to go home. It’s not a mystery how or why things feel different; The answer is always money. These billion- and trillion-dollar companies have shareholders who prize year-over-year performance over anything else. So we get more sponsored posts on Instagram. TikTok purposefully, enthusiastically overloads itself with shoppable content (which isn’t going to change no matter who owns it). YouTube is obsessed with engagement so it ends up rewarding people who flood the platform with AI slop. These platforms aren’t about human connections and the spread of creativity — the stuff that used to draw me in — they’re thinly varnished ecommerce sites sprinkled with brute-forced AI oddities.   I’d be sadder about the whole thing if I thought it could be any different. These companies are among the most valuable in the world. The fact that I can’t connect with my fellow common people using their services is not surprising. The change isn’t even driving everyone away. Instagram reported more users than ever this year, to the tune of 35 percent of the planet. Billions of users still scroll TikTok and watch YouTube Shorts. So maybe it’s just a me thing.  And I have options. Over-monetization may have made me not want to engage with a few social media behemoths, but things aren’t so dire everywhere. Bluesky reminds me of Twitter before X. I take comfort in seeing posts that prove most people are as dismayed as I am over a government and wider economic system that are nakedly uninterested in serving the public. The hot takes aren’t quite as funny as they were on Twitter years back — maybe it’s just all been said before or perhaps things have gotten too dire for levity. I still don’t end up spending a lot of time on the platform, however. It’s not as weird as it was before the defection and I get tired of the stream of news headlines contextualized with tut-tutting and handwringing — I’m perfectly capable of doing that myself.  It’d be easy to say that social media just isn’t my thing, but that’s not true because I can’t quit Reddit — the shining exception to my social media ennui. It feels filled with actual people. Ads exist, but in a subdued, manageable way. And every contributor, commenter and moderator I’ve come across on the app is militantly vigilant against the onslaught of artificially generated content. I also like the organizational structure. I know my Home tab will only expose me to my chosen subs and I derive great joy from happy cows, greeble-chasing cats, enigmatic night feelings and freaky abandoned spaces. I use my local subreddit r/Albuquerque daily to answer questions and keep tabs on the world (directly) around me. Sadly, Reddit is an outlier, a misfit exception to the rule, and now that it’s gone public, it may follow a similar monetization push. Bluesky is tiny, new and not yet profitable, so who knows where its financial journey will lead it (though the “world without Caesars” shirt gives us some hope). There’s something lamentable about the loss of the connections we gleaned from platforms that were once compelling, engrossing and rife with the creativity of our fellow humans. Ultimately, any public-facing company that prioritizes profits over everything else has no incentive to look out for its users. So I don’t expect any of the larger social platforms to pull back on their monetization marches. For now, I’ve decided I’m comfortable with my admittedly narrow interaction with the world of social media. As a Gen-Xer, online-first wasn’t how my relationship to the world started out. And I’m pretty confident I know enough about other tech-related stuff to be useful to my editors and readers without a black belt in social. (Ed. note: She is.) Besides, Karissa’s got us covered. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/in-2025-quitting-social-media-felt-easier-than-ever-140000374.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2Fsocial_media.jpg&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=7c506218c09889c3ca46d1c2d9404512f69915fb,https://www.engadget.com/social-media/in-2025-quitting-social-media-felt-easier-than-ever-140000374.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2026-01-01T14:00:00Z,7,Tech

How to watch the Bosch CES 2026 press conference live,"You may know Bosch as a home appliance brand (via its partnership with Siemens), but the German multinational is generally more focused on providing underlying technology and engineering solutions to auto, home and manufacturing partners across the globe. It&#39;s fitting, then, that much of what it&#39;s showing off at CES 2026 is more intended to be licensed to other companies versus Bosch-branded products you&#39;ll be seeing on store shelves.
Case in point is Bosch&#39;s automotive plans at CES. The company will present &#34;AI in the car,&#34; or more specifically, in the cockpit of the car. &#34;Bosch&#39;s AI-powered cockpit makes driving more comfortable, intuitive, and safer for all occupants,&#34; Bosch board member Markus Heyn said in a press release. We&#39;ll get into all the details below, as well as how to tune in to the press conference on Monday.
How to watch Bosch&#39;s CES 2026 presentation
You can livestream the event on Monday, January 5 at 12PM ET via the Bosch press page. (If the stream is embeddable, we&#39;ll also include it here.)
What to expect
Bosch will be setting up shop in the Central Hall of the Las Vegas Convention Center (booth 16203), where the company will be focusing on its three big themes — mobility, smart home integrations and manufacturing — all of which will include hardware, software and AI solutions.
Like many other CES 2026 exhibitors, look for Bosch to emphasize its partnerships with the big dogs of the AI space at the show. For instance, that AI-powered car cockpit mentioned above will feature integrations with both Microsoft and NVIDIA. For instance, Bosch is touting the ability to use voice commands to join a Teams call, while the car&#39;s system will automatically activate adaptive cruise control. And it&#39;s noting that NVIDIA&#39;s software suites will help manage &#34;real-time sensor processing and vision-language models.&#34;
Here&#39;s a glimpse of what the booth will look like:

Smart scale safety 
There are valid reasons to weigh yourself but your self-worth shouldn’t be defined by what number shows up between your feet. If you’re looking to alter your body shape, that figure could go up as your waistline goes down since muscle weighs more than fat. 
Some scales go further by providing additional metrics like visceral fat levels, giving you a more comprehensive picture of your health. Dr. Anne Swift, Director of Public Health teaching at the University of Cambridge, said “weighing yourself too often can result in [you] becoming fixated on small fluctuations day-to-day rather than the overall trend over time.” Swift added “it’s sometimes better to focus on how clothes fit, or how you feel, rather than your weight.” 
A meta-analysis from 2016 found there may be some negative psychological impact from self weighing. A 2018 study, however, said there may be a positive correlation between regular weigh-ins and accelerated weight loss. It can be a minefield and I’d urge you to take real care of yourself and remember success won’t happen overnight.

What to look for in a smart scale 
Weight 
A scale that measures weight is probably the top requirement, right? Whether you&#39;re after a basic weight scale or a full-featured body fat scale, bear in mind, with all these measurements, the readings won’t be as accurate as a calibrated clinical scale. It’s better to focus on the overall trend, up or down over time, rather than a single measurement in isolation. Scales offering high-precision measurements can help, especially if you’re looking at the data to inform a specific health or fitness goal. 
Connectivity 
Before you buy your scale, work out how you’re planning on weighing yourself and when, as it is an issue. Some lower-end smart bathroom scales connect via Bluetooth and have no internal storage, so if you don’t have your phone to hand, it won’t record your weight. If your scale has Wi-Fi, then your scale can post the data to a server, letting you access them from any compatible device. Also, you should be mindful that some smart scales aren’t built with security in mind, so there’s a small risk to your privacy should your scale be compromised. 
Bone density 
The stronger your bones are, the less risk you have of breaks and osteoporosis — common concerns as you get older. Clinical bone density tests use low-power x-rays and some scales can offer you an at-home approximation. These bone mass tests pass a small electrical current through your feet, measuring the resistance as it completes its journey. The resistance offered by bones, fat and muscle are all different, letting your scale identify the difference. A body composition monitor often includes this feature, too, providing a detailed breakdown of bone density, fat and muscle mass. 
Body fat percentage and muscle mass 
Fat and muscle are necessary parts of our makeup, but too much of either can be problematic. Much like bone density, a body composition measurement feature can monitor your body fat and muscle mass percentages using Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA). This measurement tests how well your body resists an electrical signal passing through your body. (It’s a rough rule of thumb you should have a 30/70 percent split between fat and muscle, but please consult a medical professional for figures specific to your own body and medical needs.) For those with specific athletic goals, smart scales offer an athlete mode to better tailor readings for accuracy. If body fat monitoring is a priority, look for a model marketed as a body fat scale. 
BMI 
A lot of scales offer a BMI calculation, and it’s easy to do since you just plot height and weight on a set graph line. Body Mass Index is, however, a problematic measurement that its critics say is both overly simplistic and often greatly misleading. Unfortunately, it’s also one of the most common clinical body metrics and medical professionals will use it to make judgements about your care. 
Pulse Wave Velocity 
French health-tech company Withings has offered Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV) on its flagship scale for some time, although regulatory concerns meant it was withdrawn for a period. It’s a measurement of arterial stiffness, which acts as a marker both of cardiovascular risk and other health conditions. For those looking for an even deeper understanding of their health, some scales now offer a body scan, which provides more advanced metrics such as segmental body composition and vascular health insights. 
Wearables and integration 
Pairing your smart scale with wearables like fitness trackers or smartwatches can further enhance your health-tracking ecosystem. Many smart scales sync directly with platforms like Fitbit or Apple Health, making it easier to track trends and analyze your data in one place. 
Display 
Less a specification and more a note: Smart bathroom scales have displays ranging from pre-printed LCDs or digital dot matrix layouts through to color display screens. On the high end, your scale display can show you trending charts for your weight and other vital statistics, and can even tell you the day’s weather. If you are short-sighted, and plan on weighing yourself first thing in the morning, before you’ve found your glasses or contacts, opt for a big, clear, high-contrast display. 
App and subscriptions 
You’ll spend most of your time looking at your health data through its companion scales app, and it’s vital you get a good one. This includes a clear, clean layout with powerful tools to visualize your progress and analyze your data to look for places you can improve. Given that you often don’t need to buy anything before trying the app, it’s worth testing one or two to see if you vibe with it. It’s also important you check app compatibility before making your purchase. Some health apps will only work with iOS or Android — not both. Apple Watch connectivity can also be a bonus for tracking workouts and health metrics seamlessly. Several companies also offer premium subscriptions, unlocking other features – including insights and coaching – to go along with your hardware. 
Data portability 
Using the same scale or app platform for years at a time means you’ll build up a massive trove of personal data. And it is (or should be), your right to take that data to another provider if you choose to move platforms in the future. Data portability is, however, a minefield, with different platforms offering wildly different options, making it easy (or hard) to go elsewhere. 
All of the devices in this round-up will allow you to export your data to a .CSV file, which you can then do with as you wish. Importing this information is trickier, with Withings and Garmin allowing it, and Omron, Xiaomi, Eufy and Fitbit not making it that easy. (Apps that engage with Apple Health, meanwhile, can output all of your health data in a .XML file.) 
Power 
It’s not a huge issue but one worth bearing in mind that each scale will either run disposable batteries (most commonly 4xAAA) or with its own, built-in battery pack. Either choice adds an environmental and financial cost to your scale’s life — either with regular purchases of fresh cells or the potential for the whole unit to become waste when the battery pack fails. 
How we tested and which smart scales we tested 
For this guide, I tested six scales from major manufacturers: 
Mi (Xiaomi) Body Composition Scale 2 
Our cheapest model, Xiaomi / Mi’s Body Composition Scale 2 is as bare-bones as you can get, and it shows. It often takes a long while to lock on to get your body weight, and when it does you’ll have to delve into the Zepp Life-branded scales app in order to look at your extra data. But you can’t fault it for the basics, offering limited (but accurate) weight measurements and body composition for less than the price of a McDonald’s for four. 
Fitbit Aira Air 
Fitbit, now part of Google, is the household name for fitness trackers and smartwatches in the US, right? If not, then it must be at least halfway synonymous with it. The Aria Air is the company’s stripped-to-the-bare bones scale, offering your weight and a few other health metrics, but you can trust that Fitbit got the basics right. Not to mention that most of the reason for buying a Fitbit product is to leverage its fitness app anyway. 
Anker Eufy Smart Scale P2 Pro 
Eufy’s Smart Scale P2 Pro has plenty of things to commend it – the price, the overall look and feel (it’s a snazzy piece of kit) and what it offers. It offers a whole host of in-depth functionality, including Body Fat, Muscle Mass, Water Weight, Body Fat Mass and Bone Mass measurements, as well as calculating things like your Heart Rate and Basal Metabolic Rate (the amount of calories you need to eat a day to not change weight at all) all from inside its app. In fact, buried beneath the friendly graphic, the scale offers a big pile of stats and data that should, I think, give you more than a little coaching on how to improve your overall health. 
It’s worth noting that Anker – Eufy’s parent company – was identified as having misled users, and the media, about the security of its products a few years back. Its Eufy-branded security cameras, which the company says does not broadcast video outside of your local network, was found to be allowing third parties to access streams online. Consequently, while we have praised the Eufy Smart Scale for its own features, we cannot recommend it without a big caveat. 
Omron BCM-500 Body Composition and Scale with Bluetooth 
Given its role in making actual medical devices, you know what you’re getting with an Omron product. A solid, reliable, sturdy, strong (checks the dictionary for more synonyms) dependable piece of kit. There’s no romance or excitement on show, but you can trust that however joyless it may be, it’ll do the job in question and will be user-friendly. The hardware is limited, the app is limited, but it certainly (checks synonyms again) is steady. 
Joking aside, Omron’s Connect app is as bare-bones as you can get, since it acts as an interface for so many of its products. Scroll over to the Weight page, and you’ll get your weight and BMI reading, and if you’ve set a fitness goal, you can see how far you’ve got to go to reach it. You can also switch to seeing a trend graph which, again, offers the most basic visualization of your workouts and progress. 
Garmin Index S2 
Garmin’s got a pretty massive fitness ecosystem of its own, so if you’re already part of that world, its smart scale is a no-brainer. On one hand, the scale is one of the easiest to use, and most luxurious of the bunch, with its color screen and sleek design. I’m also a big fan of the wealth of data and different metrics the scale throws at you – you can see a full color graph charting your weight measurements and goal progress, and the various metrics it tracks in good detail. If there’s a downside, it’s that Garmin’s setup won’t hold your hand, since it’s for serious fitness people, not newbies. 
Withings Body Comp 
At the highest end, Withings’ flagship Body Comp is luxurious, and luxuriously priced, a figure I’d consider to be “too much” to spend on a bathroom scale. For your money, however, you’ll get a fairly comprehensive rundown of body composition metrics including your weight, body fat percentage, vascular age, pulse wave velocity and electrodermal activity. Its monochrome dot matrix display may not be as swish as the Garmin’s, but it refreshes pretty quickly and feels very in-keeping with the hardware’s overall sleek look. 
Withings Body Scan 
If you want to flaunt your cash, you don’t buy a car, you buy a supercar, or a hypercar if you’re flush enough. What then, do we call Withings’ $400 Body Scan if not a super-smart scale, or a hyper-smart scale? As well as doing everything the Body Comp does, plus running a six-lead ECG, segmented body composition, and will even check for neuropathy in your feet. It is the best scale I’ve ever used, it is also the most expensive, and I suspect it’s too much device for almost everyone who’d consider buying one. 
Smart scales FAQs 
What&#39;s the difference between a smart scale and a regular scale? 
A regular scale is pretty straightforward — it tells you how much you weigh, and that’s usually it. A smart scale, on the other hand, does much more. Not only does it give you your weight measurements, but it can also track things like your body fat percentage, muscle mass, and even your BMI. Some smart scales even monitor more advanced metrics like bone density, depending on the model. 
What’s even better is that smart scales sync with scales apps on your phone using Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, so you can see all your health data in one place. This lets you monitor trends over time, like if your muscle mass is increasing or your body fat percentage decreasing. 
How do smart scales work with more than one person using it? 
When more than one person in a household uses the smart scale, it usually recognizes each person by their weight range and other body measurements (like body fat percentage). Most smart scales allow you to set up individual profiles in the companion app, and once your profile is linked, the scale can automatically figure out who’s standing on it. 
Let’s say you and a family member have fairly different weights — the scale will easily know who’s who based on that. But if you and someone else have similar weights, it might ask you to confirm the profile on your phone after the weigh-in. Some scales even let you assign a profile manually in the scales app if it’s not sure.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-smart-scale-160033523.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2Fa1132b80-d447-11f0-befe-5041762c622a&resize=1400%2C840&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=e96a8cc618369b6350a6e17cb9c68877d8ef614e,https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-smart-scale-160033523.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2026-01-01T10:00:37Z,9,Tech

Critical vulnerability in IBM API Connect could allow authentication bypass,"
		
					  
						




IBM is urging customers to quickly patch a critical vulnerability in its API Connect platform that could allow remote attackers to bypass authentication.



The company describes API Connect as a full lifecycle application programming interface (API) gateway used “to create, test, manage, secure, analyze, and socialize APIs.” 



It particularly touts it as a way to “unlock the potential of agentic AI” by providing a central point of control for access to AI services via APIs. The platform also includes API Agent, which automates tasks across the API lifecycle using AI.



A key component is a customizable self-service portal that allows developers to easily onboard themselves, and to discover and consume multiple types of API, including SOAP, REST, events, ASyncAPIs, GraphQL, and others.



The flaw, tracked as CVE-2025-13915, affects IBM API Connect versions 10.0.8.0 through 10.0.8.5, and version 10.0.11.0, and could give unauthorized access to the exposed applications, with no user interaction required.



An architectural assumption is broken



“CVE-2025-13915 is not best understood as a security bug,” said Sanchit Vir Gogia, chief analyst at Greyhound Research. “It is better understood as a moment where a long standing architectural assumption finally breaks in the open. The assumption is simple and deeply embedded in enterprise design: If traffic passes through the API gateway, identity has been enforced and trust has been established. This vulnerability proves that assumption can fail completely.”



He noted that the classification of the weakness, which maps to CWE-305, is important because it rules out a whole class of what he called comforting explanations. “This is not stolen credentials. It is not role misconfiguration. It is not a permissions mistake,” he said. “The authentication enforcement itself can be circumvented.” 



When that happens, he explained, downstream services do not simply face elevated risk, they lose the foundation on which their access decisions were built because they do not revalidate identity. They were never designed to; they inherit trust. 



“Once enforcement fails upstream, inherited trust becomes unearned trust, and the exposure propagates silently,”  he said. “This class of vulnerability aligns with automation, broad scanning, and opportunistic probing rather than careful targeting.”



Interim fixes provided



IBM said that the issue was discovered during internal testing, and it has provided interim fixes for each affected version of the software, with individual update details for VMware, OCP/CP4I, and Kubernetes.



The only mitigation suggested for the flaw, according to IBM’s security bulletin, is this: “Customers unable to install the interim fix should disable self-service sign-up on their Developer Portal if enabled, which will help minimize their exposure to this vulnerability.”



The company also notes in its installation instructions for the fixes that the image overrides described in the document must be removed when upgrading to the next release or fixpack.



This, said Gogia, further elevates the risk. “That is not a cosmetic detail,” he noted. “Management planes define configuration truth, lifecycle control, and operational authority across the platform. When remediation touches this layer, the vulnerability sits close to the control core, not at an isolated gateway edge. That raises both blast radius and remediation risk.” 



This is because errors in these areas can turn into prolonged exposure or service instability. “[Image overrides] also introduce a governance hazard: Image overrides create shadow state; if they are not explicitly removed later, they persist quietly,” he pointed out. “Over time, they drift out of visibility, ownership, and audit scope. This is how temporary fixes turn into long term risk.”



Most valuable outcome: Learning



He added that the operational challenges involved in remediation are not so much in knowing what has to be done, but in doing it fast enough without breaking the business. And, he said, API governance now needs to include up to date inventories of APIs, their versions, dependencies, and exposure points, as well as monitoring of behavior.



“The most valuable outcome here is not closure,” Gogia observed. “It is learning. Enterprises should ask what would have happened if this flaw had been exploited quietly for weeks. Which services would have trusted the gateway implicitly? Which logs would have shown abnormal behavior? Which teams would have noticed first? Those answers reveal whether trust assumptions are visible or invisible. Organizations that stop at patching will miss a rare opportunity to strengthen resilience before the next control plane failure arrives.”

Instagram chief: AI is so ubiquitous 'it will be more practical to fingerprint real media than fake media',"It&#39;s no secret that AI-generated content took over our social media feeds in 2025. Now, Instagram&#39;s top exec Adam Mosseri has made it clear that he expects AI content to overtake non-AI imagery and the significant implications that shift has for its creators and photographers.Mosseri shared the thoughts in a lengthy post about the broader trends he expects to shape Instagram in 2026. And he offered a notably candid assessment on how AI is upending the platform. &#34;Everything that made creators matter—the ability to be real, to connect, to have a voice that couldn’t be faked—is now suddenly accessible to anyone with the right tools,&#34; he wrote. &#34;The feeds are starting to fill up with synthetic everything.&#34;But Mosseri doesn&#39;t seem particularly concerned by this shift. He says that there is &#34;a lot of amazing AI content&#34; and that the platform may need to rethink its approach to labeling such imagery by &#34;fingerprinting real media, not just chasing fake.&#34;From Mosseri (emphasis his):Social media platforms are going to come under increasing pressure to identify and label AI-generated content as such. All the major platforms will do good work identifying AI content, but they will get worse at it over time as AI gets better at imitating reality. There is already a growing number of people who believe, as I do, that it will be more practical to fingerprint real media than fake media. Camera manufacturers could cryptographically sign images at capture, creating a chain of custody.On some level, it&#39;s easy to understand how this seems like a more practical approach for Meta. As we&#39;ve previously reported, technologies that are meant to identify AI content, like watermarks, have proved unreliable at best. They are easy to remove and even easier to ignore altogether. Meta&#39;s own labels are far from clear and the company, which has spent tens of billions of dollars on AI this year alone, has admitted it can&#39;t reliably detect AI-generated or manipulated content on its platform.That Mosseri is so readily admitting defeat on this issue, though, is telling. AI slop has won. And when it comes to helping Instagram&#39;s 3 billion users understand what is real, that should largely be someone else&#39;s problem, not Meta&#39;s. Camera makers – presumably phone makers and actual camera manufacturers — should come up with their own system that sure sounds a lot like watermarking to &#34;to verify authenticity at capture.&#34; Mosseri offers few details about how this would work or be implemented at the scale required to make it feasible.Mosseri also doesn&#39;t really address the fact that this is likely to alienate the many photographers and other Instagram creators who have already grown frustrated with the app. The exec regularly fields complaints from the group who want to know why Instagram&#39;s algorithm doesn&#39;t consistently surface their posts to their on followers.But Mosseri suggests those complaints stem from an outdated vision of what Instagram even is. The feed of &#34;polished&#34; square images, he says, &#34;is dead.&#34; Camera companies, in his estimation, are &#34;are betting on the wrong aesthetic&#34; by trying to &#34;make everyone look like a professional photographer from the past.&#34; Instead, he says that more &#34;raw&#34; and &#34;unflattering&#34; images will be how creators can prove they are real, and not AI. In a world where Instagram has more AI content than not, creators should prioritize images and videos that intentionally make them look bad. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/instagram-chief-ai-is-so-ubiquitous-it-will-be-more-practical-to-fingerprint-real-media-than-fake-media-202620080.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2F2025-12%2F872ec860-88d5-412d-8e0b-3c4947e70b54&resize=1400%2C856&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=3260be40613bc6f0f86e3365f7f215c06331a78f,https://www.engadget.com/social-media/instagram-chief-ai-is-so-ubiquitous-it-will-be-more-practical-to-fingerprint-real-media-than-fake-media-202620080.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-31T20:26:20Z,7,Tech
"How to watch Samsung's ""First Look"" CES 2026 presentation","NurPhoto via Getty Images
Samsung is arguably the 800-pound gorilla of CES, with a full spectrum of products that range from phones and computers to refrigerators to AI assistants and rolling robots. But for CES 2026, the company is shaking up the schedule a bit: Instead of its longtime midday Monday press conference position, the Korean giant will front-run the entire show with a Sunday night presentation.
Samsung has already given a few hints as to what&#39;s on the agenda, but what we&#39;re really hoping to see is an update on the Ballie robot — a star of previous CES presentations that ostensibly missed its previously promised 2025 release date.
How to watch Samsung&#39;s &#34;The First Look&#34; presentation at CES 2026
The event will stream live from the Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas on Sunday, January 4 at 10PM ET. There are several ways to tune in: you can watch via the Samsung Newsroom, Samsung Electronics’ official YouTube channel or via Samsung TV Plus. (We&#39;ll embed the stream here once it appears on the channel.)
What to expect from Samsung at CES 2026
Keynote speaker TM Roh, the CEO of Samsung&#39;s Device eXperience (DX) Division, will discuss the company&#39;s plans for the new year and beyond, which will (of course) include &#34;new AI-driven customer experiences,&#34; the company said in a press release. In addition, we&#39;ll hear from the President and Head of the Visual Display Business, SW Yong and Executive Vice President and Head of Digital Appliances Business, Cheolgi Kim. Those two will &#34;share their respective business directions for the upcoming year.&#34;
But if you&#39;re looking for more specifics, Samsung is following its &#34;Advent calendar&#34; approach to early CES announcements, with new press releases dropping nearly each day. So far, we know that — like competitors LG and Hisense — the company will be offering details on a line of micro RGB TVs (replete with confirmed screen sizes of 55 to 115 inches). Also confirmed: a full line of appliances infused with what Samsung calls Bespoke AI.
It&#39;s likely Samsung will map out its CES plans in greater detail as the January 4 event approaches, so we&#39;ll update this story accordingly when it does.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/how-to-watch-samsungs-first-look-ces-2026-presentation-190027604.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F67724120-dd18-11f0-b7f5-5ab143ff1f4e&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=48e24ea1f494a88c70f7a5e0932d5df3ae95cd11,https://www.engadget.com/mobile/how-to-watch-samsungs-first-look-ces-2026-presentation-190027604.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-31T19:00:27Z,8,Tech

How to watch the Sony Honda Afeela CES 2026 press conference,"
Sony&#39;s CES 2026 press conference is just days away, but this year has a twist: Instead of an overview of Sony&#39;s electronics, video game and Hollywood studio plans for the new year, the presser will apparently have a more narrow focus: electric vehicles. That&#39;s because the traditional end-of-press-day slot isn&#39;t just Sony, but rather Sony Honda Mobility — the joint venture responsible for the Afeela 1 electric car that has been showcased at CES for the better part of a decade. This year, however, we&#39;ll also apparently get to see a an all-new concept model at the event, too. 
How to watch the Sony Afeela CES 2026 press conference
The event will be streamed live from Las Vegas on Monday, January 5 at 8PM ET via the Afeela official YouTube channel. (We&#39;ll embed the stream here once it appears on the channel.)
What to expect from Sony Afeela at CES
What&#39;s now the Afeela 1 has been shown in various incarnations since CES 2020, where it was originally announced as Vision-S. But so many more important details were confirmed in the past couple of years, including the price, which starts at a staggering $89,900. However, the earlier impressions were less than impressive, and as of CES 2025, that thought remains the same. Engadget&#39;s automotive expert Tim Stevens said earlier this year that the EV &#34;feels like a PlayStation 4 in the PS5 era,&#34; and that &#34;the car lost what little interesting styling it had while sticking true to some specifications that sounded good five years ago.&#34; Ouch.
But the Afeela 1 won&#39;t be the only vehicle on display. Its CES booth will showcase &#34;several Afeela 1 pre-production vehicles in multiple color variations, alongside a new Afeela concept model,&#34; Sony Honda Mobility said in a press release.
We&#39;re hoping to hear about what&#39;s new and improved at CES 2026, and we&#39;re also excited to see its newest concept model. And between booth displays and press releases, we&#39;re hoping we&#39;ll get to see at least a few new Sony Electronics products on the docket for 2026, too.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/how-to-watch-the-sony-honda-afeela-ces-2026-press-conference-130048622.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F3f099890-d9ef-11f0-a3f3-bb8a02df8254&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=79186135ced099dc039e40ac5680ec450d04f68c,https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/how-to-watch-the-sony-honda-afeela-ces-2026-press-conference-130048622.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-31T18:42:16Z,7,Tech
January's PS Plus Monthly Games include Need for Speed Unbound and Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed,"Sony has revealed the first batch of PlayStation Plus Monthly Games for 2026. There are three titles to play this month, all of which drop on January 6. As always, you’ll retain access to these games as long as your subscription remains active.

First up, there&#39;s Need For Speed Unbound. This is a racing game that came out at the tail-end of 2022 and was the first entry in the franchise for several years before that. It has a unique visual style, thanks to cel-shaded graphics, with all kinds of vehicles to choose from. There are street racing challenges, weekly qualifiers and a minigame that has you outrunning the cops. The rapper A$AP Rocky also plays a prominent role in the narrative. It&#39;ll only available for PS5.

Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is a recently-released remake of a 2010 Wii game, but there&#39;s no Wiimote waggle here. This is just a great platformer with plenty of fan service for long-time Disney fans. Warren Spector, the lead designer of Deus Ex, was heavily involved in the making of this one. It&#39;ll be playable on both PS4 and PS5.

Core Keeper is a remarkable indie that has been floating around in early access for several years. The mining sim is now finished and offers an emphasis on crafting, base-building and, of course, exploration. While the game is playable solo, it&#39;s primarily intended as a multiplayer experience for up to eight people.
As the year ends, so does access to December&#39;s PS Plus Monthly titles. Subscribers have until January 5 to download Lego Horizon Adventures, Killing Floor 3, The Outlast Trials, Synduality Echo of Ada and Neon White.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/januarys-ps-plus-monthly-games-include-need-for-speed-unbound-and-disney-epic-mickey-rebrushed-182335673.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F6e554e70-e672-11f0-9faf-8053d38c5c2c&resize=1400%2C785&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=3f6d74b2e1317fbc64248fd932e7bfac27ff56f0,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/januarys-ps-plus-monthly-games-include-need-for-speed-unbound-and-disney-epic-mickey-rebrushed-182335673.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-31T18:23:35Z,7,Tech
How to watch the LG press conference at CES 2026,"LG
For years, LG has kicked off CES press day with the first event of the morning — and 2026 will be no different. The Korea-based corporation is theming its presentation as  &#34;Innovation in Tune with You,&#34; and — if it follows the template of past presentations — it will highlight both the consumer electronics and large appliance sides of its mammoth global businesses.
Like nearly all tech-centric events these days, expect AI to be the binding theme of the LG presentation at CES 2026. Just be aware that, like Apple, LG has its own customized abbreviation for AI: &#34;Affectionate Intelligence.&#34; The company will share &#34;its vision for elevating daily life through Affectionate Intelligence — delivering harmonized and seamlessly connected customer experiences.&#34; In other words, the company is aiming for its devices to become more connected and self-automated than ever. Here&#39;s how you can stream it and what you can expect.
How to watch LG&#39;s CES 2026 presentation
The event will stream live from Las Vegas on Monday, January 5 at 11AM ET. You&#39;ve got a few options for tuning in — watch the livestream on the LG website, the LG Global X channel or the LG Global YouTube channel (embedded below).


What to expect
Here&#39;s what LG has already confirmed it will be showcasing at CES 2026: 

LG will debut its first Micro RGB TV, a display with a cutting-edge screen technology with multicolor backlights that should one-up mini LED displays. The size options are 100 inches, 86 inches and 75 inches.
The company is countering Samsung&#39;s Frame TVs with its new LG Gallery TV, arriving in 55- and 65-inch screen sizes.
Look for a new LG humanoid home automation robot named CLOiD to take the stage. 
In the audio realm, the Korean multinational will also introduce a Dolby-powered modular home audio system and a new line of its xboom speakers (developed with musician will.i.am). 

Does that leave any surprises for the CES press conference? We&#39;ll find out on January 5. 
Update, December 31 2025, 12:36PM ET: This story has been updated to include more LG CES pre-announcements, and to embed the YouTube stream. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/how-to-watch-the-lg-press-conference-at-ces-2026-190159474.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F6f089c60-db4f-11f0-ab9d-5c52fd4922f7&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=014dedbd94400951da2d5d0cb359843f14062876,https://www.engadget.com/home/how-to-watch-the-lg-press-conference-at-ces-2026-190159474.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-31T17:37:17Z,13,Tech
CES 2026: What to expect when tech's biggest conference starts on January 4,"The new year is upon us, and that means CES 2026 is imminent. The biggest tech trade show of the calendar comes with a bevy of new and notable announcements that set the tone for trends and expectations for the subsequent 12 months. The CES 2026 show floor is officially open from January 6 through 9, but the fun kicks off with events on Sunday January 4, followed by a host of press conferences on Monday. As always, product demos, announcements and networking will be happening at the Las Vegas Convention Center and other hotels all over the city. As usual, Engadget will be covering the event in-person and remotely, bringing you news and hands-ons straight from the show floor.More specific details and pre-announcements are already trickling out as CES approaches, and thanks to the schedule of the Consumer Technology Association (the trade organization that runs the show) we have a full itinerary of press conferences. We’re also using our experience and expertise to predict what tech trends could rear their heads at the show.The CES 2026 schedulePress conferences and show floor booths are the bread and butter of CES. The CTA has already published a searchable directory of who will have an official presence at the show, along with a schedule of every official panel and presentation. However, the press conference schedule gives us a more digestible rundown of the first 48 hours of big events. On Sunday, January 4, Samsung will kick-off CES with &#34;The First Look,&#34; a presentation hosted by TM Roh, the CEO of Samsung&#39;s DX Division, on the company&#39;s &#34;vision for the DX (Device eXperience) Division in 2026, along with new AI-driven customer experiences.&#34; Ahead of that, though, Samsung has already outlined a variety of more specifics (scroll down for details).  Concurrent with the Samsung presentation will be the official CES Unveiled mini-show, which is generally comprised of smaller and start-up vendors. That&#39;ll be followed by multiple press conferences throughout Monday, January 5. The LG CES 2026 press conference, titled &#34;Innovation in Tune with You,&#34; is ostensibly to share &#34;its vision for elevating daily life through Affectionate Intelligence.&#34; But, like Samsung, this fellow Korean giant has already spent the three weeks leading up to CES pre-announcing many of its new products, so this may be more of a summary than breaking news. Following LG, we’ll also see press conferences from Bosch and Hisense, as well as the first-ever CES appearance from Lego. As the Las Vegas afternoon rolls around, we get the first of three chip giants: NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang takes the stage on January 5 at 1PM PT (4PM ET) and, according to the website, his presentation will last about 90 minutes. Based on the description on the listing, the presentation will “showcase the latest NVIDIA solutions driving innovation and productivity across industries.” NVIDIA’s presser is concurrent with one from Hyundai, where the Korean automotive company will focus on in-cabin car tech and robotics. Later in the day, we get to hear from NVIDIA frenemies Intel and AMD. Intel’s 3PM PT (6PM PT) event will ostensibly feature its new Core Ultra Series 3 processors, and AMD CEO Lisa Su will cover AMD&#39;s upcoming chip announcements at a keynote address that closes out the day. But expect both of them to be very heavy on AI applications, of course. Sandwiched in between those chip manufacturers will be Sony Honda Mobility. The joint venture will be offering yet more details on its Afeela EV. Finally, on Tuesday, January 6, Lenovo CEO Yuanqing Yang will host Lenovo&#39;s Tech World Conference at the Las Vegas Sphere, using the large and decidedly curved screen to share the company&#39;s &#34;commitment to delivering smarter AI for all by constantly redefining how technology can engage, inspire, and empower.&#34; It’s worth noting that Lenovo is the parent company of Motorola, which still makes phones and foldables that feature AI tools, so it’s possible those devices feature in the presentation as well. Samsung and LG vie for pre-show publicityAs noted above, both Samsung and LG have continued their recent trend of spoiling nearly all of their respective CES announcements in the days and weeks before the show. LG, for example, has said it will debut its first Micro RGB television at CES. While details are scarce, the company’s press release for the LG Micro RGB evo did confirm it has received certifications by Intertek for 100 percent color gamut coverage in DCI-P3 an Adobe RGB, and that it has more than a thousand dimming zones for brightness control. Elsewhere in the TV space, LG is throwing its hat into the “art TV” ring that Samsung pioneered with its Frame TVs: The LG Gallery TV will debut in 55- and 65-inch screen sizes, and it will of course show off various artwork when it’s not otherwise in use. And if PC gaming displays are more your speed, LG will have that covered, too, with a new line of 5K-capable gaming monitors on deck with built-in AI upscaling.But LG’s not just showing off displays. The Korean multinational will also introduce a Dolby-powered modular home audio system, a new line of its xboom speakers (developed with will.i.am) and the company will flex its automation muscles with a humanoid home automation robot named CLOiD. Of course, Samsung refuses to be outdone by its hometown rival, and has also released a pre-CES press release document dump. Samsung will be launching its own lineup of Micro RGB TVs at CES, for starters. The company already introduced its first Micro RGB TV at CES 2025, which was a 115-inch model available for a cool $30,000. Next year, Samsung is expanding the range with 55-, 65-, 75-, 85-, 100- and 115-inch models that use the next evolution of the company’s Micro RGB technology. Samsung is also countering LG’s 5K monitors with a 6K model that aims to deliver glasses-free 3D (another long-time CES staple). It’ll be one of several new displays in the company’s Odyssey gaming line.And on the audio front, Samsung has teased several new soundbars and speakers, including Sonos-style Wi-Fi streaming models call the Music Studio 5 and Studio 7.Outside of the formal introduction of new products and initiatives, reading the tea leaves of what was announced last year and what companies are reportedly working on, we can make some educated guesses at what we could see at CES 2026.New chips from AMD, Intel and QualcommCES is frequently the start of a cascade of new chip announcements for a given year, and one of the first places new silicon appears in real consumer products. AMD will likely use its keynote to introduce new versions of its Ryzen chips, including the recently spotted Ryzen 7 9850X3D, which is expected to offer better single-threaded performance, and the Ryzen 9000G series, which could be built with AMD&#39;s Zen 5 architecture. The company might also use its CES stage to go over its new FSR Redstone AI upscaling tech.Intel has already publicly announced that it&#39;ll launch its Panther Lake chips at CES 2026. The officially titled Intel Core Ultra Series 3 chips fit into Intel&#39;s overall &#34;AI PC&#34; push, but are specifically meant for premium laptops. Based on a preview from October 2025, Intel says the first chip made with its 2-nanometer 18A process will offer 50 percent more processing performance than previous generations and for the chip&#39;s Arc GPU, a 50 percent performance bump from last generation.Qualcomm is also rumored to be targeting laptops at the show, building on the work it&#39;s done moving its Snapdragon chips out of phones and tablets and into other types of computers. The company&#39;s Snapdragon X2 Elite and X2 Elite Premium chips should start appearing in laptops at CES 2026, offering a look at the improved speed and AI performance the company promised in 2025.Brighter, &#34;truer&#34; screensAs noted above, Samsung and LG appear to be going all-in on Micro RGB display tech for TVs. Expect that to be a huge buzzword at CES, with Hisense and Sony debuting new models, too.Sony announced a collection of new Bravia TVs in April 2025, replacing the company&#39;s flagship, filling in its midrange options and adding a new budget model to the mix. The star of this updated Bravia lineup is the Bravia 9, which features a QD-OLED panel, but Sony appears to be prepping entirely new display tech for 2026. In March 2025, Sony introduced a new RGB LED panel that uses individual Mini LED backlights colored in red, green and blue to produce even brighter, more accurate colors. In contrast to a QD-OLED, which filters a layer of blue organic light emitting diodes through quantum dots that change color, Sony&#39;s &#34;General RGB LED Backlight Technology&#34; can get as bright as a Mini LED panel without needing an extra filter layer or worrying about OLED&#39;s problems with burn-in. The company has already trademarked the name &#34;True RGB,&#34; which could end up being what Sony calls this new flavor of display if it decides to show them off at CES. It seems entirely likely, because CES is nothing if not a TV show — it’s a sure bet that we’ll see new TVs from the likes of LG and Samsung in addition to Sony. If the company doesn&#39;t introduce new display tech for its TVs, it does have a new 240Hz PlayStation monitor coming in 2026 that it could show off at CES instead.Sony isn&#39;t the only company hyped on bright screens. Samsung is reportedly pushing an updated version of the HDR10 and HDR10+ standards that could be ready to demo at CES 2026. The new HDR10+ Advanced standard would be Samsung&#39;s answer to Dolby Vision 2, which includes support for things bi-directional tone mapping and intelligent features that automatically adapt sports and gaming content. Samsung&#39;s take will reportedly offer improved brightness, genre-based tone mapping and intelligent motion smoothing options, among other improvements.And maybe your future TV won’t need a power cord, either: Displace will be showing off a mounting option that includes a 15,000mAh battery to juice up whatever giant TV screen you choose to attach.Ballie Watch 2026The ball-shaped yellow robot lovingly known as &#34;Ballie&#34; has been announced twice, first in 2020 and then again in 2024 with a projector in tow. Samsung said Ballie would go on sale in 2025 at CES last year and then shared in April 2025 that Ballie would ship this summer with Google&#39;s Gemini onboard. But it&#39;s nearly 2026, and Ballie is nowhere to be seen. It&#39;s possible Samsung could make a third attempt at announcing its robot at CES 2026, but whether or not it does, robotics will still be a big part of the show.Robot vacuums and mops were a major highlight of CES 2025, and it&#39;s safe to expect notable improvements from the new models that are announced at CES 2026. Not every company will adopt the retractable arm of the Roborock Saros Z70, but robot vacuums with legs for rising over small ledges like the Dreame X50 seem like they could become the norm. Roborock could also show off its new Roborock Qrevo Curv 2 Flow, the first of its robot vacuums to feature a retractable roller mop.Beyond just traversing spaces more efficiently, improving robots&#39; navigation could also be a major concern at the show. Prominent members of the AI industry are turning their attention from large language models to world models, which aim to give AI a deep understanding of physical space. Those world models could be the key to making robots — like LG’s aforementioned CLOiD — competent at navigating homes and workplaces, and will likely be a significant talking point at CES 2026.We’ll be updating this article throughout the month as more rumors surface and new products are confirmed — stay tuned for future updates!Update, December 11 2025, 11:03AM ET: This story has been updated to include detail on Lenovo being Motorola’s parent company and how the latter might have a part in the Tuesday presentation.Update, December 16 2025, 1:33PM ET: This story has been updated to include the NVIDIA press conference, which was added to the CTA schedule within the last two days.Update, December 23 2025, 7:28AM ET: This story has been updated to include LG and Samsung’s Micro RGB TV announcements, which were made public in the past seven days.

How to use a VPN,"Chances are that if a VPN is marketed to everyday users, it more or less runs itself. As long as you go with one of the best VPNs instead of setting up your own manual connection, the interface is likely built so you have to engage with it as little as possible. Generally, if you find yourself constantly thinking about your VPN while using it — as happened to me with Norton VPN — that&#39;s a bad thing and you should change providers.That said, it&#39;s still useful to get a high-level view of how to use a VPN, especially if you&#39;ve never used one before. In this article, I&#39;ll walk you through how to download, install and configure a VPN on any platform and how to choose servers for specific situations. I&#39;ll also discuss specific steps for desktop and laptop computers, phones, tablets, smart TVs, game consoles and routers.How to download and install a VPNThere are over 100 VPNs available on the internet and the two big mobile app stores, but most of them follow a similar approach to download and installation. Except for certain free VPNs, you&#39;ll need to create an account on the VPN provider&#39;s website, install the VPN client, then use your account to log in. Here are the steps.In a web browser, navigate to a VPN provider&#39;s website. For suggestions on where to start, check out our list of the best VPN deals. Click any link that mentions getting the VPN or claiming the deal — as a rule, they aren&#39;t hard to find.Select a plan based on the length of time you need the VPN for, the features you want and the number of devices you&#39;d like to use the VPN on simultaneously. Add a payment method. You&#39;ll be prompted to create the username and password for a new account.On desktop, you can start with the Mac or Windows app store, though some VPNs require a download directly from their respective website. That’s generally the way to get the most feature-rich version of the VPN, but just make sure you’re downloading from the provider’s website to ensure you don’t get a malicious copycat. On mobile, the app store is your only choice, but don&#39;t forget to check the reviews and make sure you&#39;re getting the service you paid for — unfortunately, rival (and sometimes less scrupulous) VPN brands can use paid placements to appear higher on search results, even for a rival product. Follow the pre-programmed installation flow. Again, don&#39;t let a VPN make any changes to your system if you haven&#39;t thoroughly vetted the provider (or gone with one of our recommendations). If it&#39;s safe, allow the VPN all the setup permissions it needs.Finally, open the VPN client and sign in with the credentials you created in step two. You&#39;re now ready to start using your new VPN.Surfshark in Mac downloads folderSam Chapman for EngadgetWith so many VPNs on the market, this process won&#39;t always be the same. Sometimes you&#39;ll have to make the account before paying, and some mobile VPNs let you handle the whole process in-app. What&#39;s always true, though, is that a good VPN will make the signup flow as easy as possible. If you have trouble before you even log in, that&#39;s a red flag.How to configure a VPN appMost VPNs are ready to go out of the box. However, even if you don&#39;t think you&#39;re a power user, it&#39;s a good idea to go through the settings and make sure they match what you need. Here are a few steps I recommend taking.Activate the kill switch. This feature monitors your connection to the VPN server. If it ever drops — either from problems in the server, your client or somewhere in between — the kill switch instantly cuts off your internet until your VPN connection is restored. This saves you from accidentally broadcasting anything sensitive while also ensuring you only connect to legitimate VPN servers (avoiding the Tunnelvision bug).Set up favorites and profiles. VPNs usually let you select servers you&#39;ll use regularly, websites you&#39;ll often connect to through the VPN and other preferences that will appear immediately when you open the app. Some go further, like Proton VPN, which lets you create user profiles that bundle several preferences together.Decide if you want the VPN to automatically launch and connect when you start up your computer.Check on split tunneling. There may be cases where you want a certain app or site to work outside the VPN, or where you want everything to go unencrypted except one site or app. You can set up a split tunnel when you need it, but if there&#39;s one you know you&#39;ll use regularly, it helps to build it early.Activate or deactivate any content blockers the VPN comes with, including ad blockers, malware detectors and parental controls, as you see fit.Decide whether you want the VPN to send you notifications, and how.Select a VPN protocol. It&#39;s almost always best to let the VPN choose for itself, but it&#39;s helpful to at least know where the protocol-switching option is. Occasionally, if one protocol isn&#39;t working, you can troubleshoot by selecting another.You can do all this by digging into your VPN&#39;s preferences control panel. A gear seems to be the universal icon for that, but Mac users may also find it by picking &#34;preferences&#34; or &#34;settings&#34; from the menu bar. When you find the preferences menu, go through each tab in turn and make sure everything is the way you like it.How to choose a VPN serverPicking a server location is the final box to check before connecting. You nearly always have the option of letting the VPN pick the best server. Most apps tend to determine the best server with a latency test, so it will almost always be a node very close to your physical location.If you just want anonymity online, that&#39;s fine — it doesn&#39;t matter which IP address you use as long as it&#39;s not your real one. But several VPN use cases do require a specific server location. For those, follow one simple rule: Pick a server in the place you want your signal to come from.Choosing locations on SurfsharkSam Chapman for EngadgetFor example, let&#39;s say you want to watch The Office, but you&#39;re only subscribed to Netflix and not Peacock. Luckily, Netflix is licensed to show The Office in the U.K. If you connect to a British server location before opening Netflix, you&#39;ll be able to access the show without paying for an extra subscription. (Of course, make sure VPNs aren’t expressly banned by the streaming service’s terms of service before accessing it while using one.)Other than streaming, the most common reason you&#39;ll need a specific VPN server is to get around firewalls that block websites. Whether it&#39;s your school doing the censorship, your workplace or your entire state, the solution is the same: Pick a VPN server outside the restricted region. Censorship systems filter by location — they can&#39;t block where they don&#39;t have jurisdiction. Get a new virtual location and you should be free and clear. (Always be cognizant of the laws on VPN usage in your location before activating them.)When to use a VPN (and when not to)It&#39;s good to get into the habit of connecting to your VPN whenever you get online. You can never be sure what information your ISP is gathering on you. If you&#39;re using unprotected Wi-Fi, or a public network with a clearly visible password, anybody might be listening in. Even if you don&#39;t need a particular location, always be using your VPN.The only reason you might want to be online without a VPN is that certain websites, especially online banks, get suspicious if they note repeated logins to the same account from too many different IP addresses. For those cases, you can either set up a split tunnel to exclude the website from encryption, or temporarily turn your VPN off altogether.Instructions for specific devicesAlthough most VPNs try to keep their apps similar on every platform, the strictures of differing hardware and software lead them to install and operate differently. In case you still have questions after reading the general guide above, this section goes into detail on every platform where you might use a VPN.How to use a VPN on desktopAfter subscribing to a VPN on Windows, you should be directed to download an EXE file — if this doesn&#39;t happen, log into your account on the website and find the downloads center. Find the folder where the EXE is saved, double-click it and follow the onscreen instructions.On Mac, the process is more or less the same, except you&#39;ll usually get a PKG file instead of an EXE. Go to your downloads folder (either in Finder or through your web browser) and double-click the PKG file. Grant the VPN whatever permissions it needs. (Again, this is why it’s important to only use a legitimate vendor, such as the ones we recommend.)Once installed, you can open the VPN client at any time by double-clicking the icon again. Some VPNs open as separate windows, while others will add icons to your toolbar. This often varies by platform; if you&#39;re concerned that your VPN doesn&#39;t look like a screenshot you&#39;ve seen, check which operating system the image comes from.How to use a VPN on mobileOn Android and iOS, you&#39;ll download your VPN app through the Google Play Store or Apple App Store, respectively. Even if you get started through a mobile browser, it will probably redirect you to the app store for the actual download and installation.Follow the usual step for downloading an app: search for its name in the app store, click &#34;Get&#34; or &#34;Install,&#34; then let your phone cook. As always, so long as it&#39;s a vetted VPN, grant it the permissions it needs. You may be able to download and install the VPN first, then create your account and submit payment through the app afterward.One final note: several leading VPNs offer free trials for mobile users. If you see a button that says something like &#34;get free trial,&#34; you may be able to use the VPN for several days without paying. Just be warned that if the trial lapses, you might get automatically signed up for a plan that&#39;s longer than you&#39;d like.How to use a VPN browser extensionVPNs offer browser extensions as lightweight versions of their main clients. While a desktop or mobile VPN reroutes everything that device sends to the internet, a browser extension only protects traffic through your web browser. You can use one as a primitive form of split tunneling, but they&#39;re mainly for basic convenience — most of what you do online goes through a browser, so it&#39;s nice to be able to protect your connection without opening a separate app.NordVPN browser extension on ChromeSam Chapman for EngadgetTo use a VPN browser extension, just create your account as normal, then download the extension from your VPN&#39;s website. You can manage it from your browser&#39;s extensions center. That&#39;s a jigsaw piece at the top-right corner on most browsers, including Chrome, Edge and Firefox.How to use a VPN on a smart TVYou can use a VPN to change your location and stream international content directly to a smart TV. The catch is that not all smart TV brands support VPN apps. For those that don&#39;t, you&#39;ll have to find a workaround.The good news is that a ton of the best smart TVs can natively host VPNs, including Google TV, Android TV, Amazon Fire TV and Apple TV (though only tvOS 17 and above). To use a VPN on Android TV or Apple TV, go through the device&#39;s app store. On Fire TV, simply type the name of your chosen VPN provider into the search bar.On smart TVs that don&#39;t have native VPN, like LG, Roku and Samsung, you have a few options. You can use a smart DNS feature like ExpressVPN&#39;s MediaStreamer to reroute smart TV traffic without full VPN encryption; the steps for this are different for every VPN, so check the provider&#39;s website. You can also install a VPN on your router (see below) so your smart TV automatically uses the router&#39;s location.Finally, you can get a temporary fix by using your computer as a Wi-Fi hotspot while it has a VPN active. Follow the steps for your operating system.On Windows:In your system settings, go to &#34;Network &amp; Internet&#34; and turn on the mobile hotspot.Go to &#34;Network &amp; Sharing Center&#34; and click &#34;Change adapter settings.&#34;Right-click the name of your VPN provider and go to &#34;Properties,&#34; then &#34;Sharing.&#34;Check the boxes next to &#34;Allow other network users to connect through this computer&#39;s internet connection&#34; and &#34;Allow other network users to control or disable the shared internet connection.&#34;Click the &#34;Home networking connection&#34; dropdown and select &#34;Microsoft Wi-Fi Direct Virtual Adapter.&#34;Open your VPN client and connect to a server in your desired location.On your smart TV, open the internet connections menu and select the name of your PC. Your TV is now online through the VPN server.On Mac:Open system settings and go to the &#34;General&#34; tab. Scroll down and click &#34;Sharing.&#34;Toggle &#34;Internet Sharing&#34; on, then click on &#34;Configure.&#34;Click the &#34;Share your connection from&#34; dropdown, then choose the VPN installed on the Mac. Under &#34;To computers using,&#34; select &#34;Wi-Fi.&#34;Click on &#34;Wi-Fi options&#34; and enter a name and password for your hotspot network.On your smart TV, connect to the network you just created.How to use a VPN on a game consoleRight now, there&#39;s no such thing as a game console with native VPN support. If you want to use a VPN while gaming — and I recommend that for safety if you&#39;re planning to play online — you can use two of the same methods that work for a smart TV: install a VPN on your router, or get your console online through a Mac or PC hotspot.How to install a VPN on a routerWhen you install a router VPN, anything that gets online through your home network will be protected, including game consoles, TVs and smart devices that don&#39;t support VPNs natively. It&#39;s not a process for the faint of heart, though. You&#39;ll need to get a new router and potentially install VPN firmware on it yourself. If you want to go this route, the easiest option is to get an ExpressVPN Aircove router — not only does it come with all the settings done for you, but it can be managed through the same clean interface as ExpressVPN&#39;s other apps.We don&#39;t have space here to go through the entire process, but here&#39;s a general overview. First, get a router with firmware that supports VPN configurations — most ISP default routers don&#39;t, so you&#39;ll have to go third-party.Next, go to the downloads center of your VPN&#39;s website and look for the section with VPN configurations. A &#34;configuration&#34; is a complete set of the information needed to access a certain VPN server through a certain protocol — say, a Proton VPN server in Arizona through OpenVPN. Download a configuration file for the protocol and location you want all your home devices to connect through.Finally, open your router control panel by entering your router&#39;s IP address into a web browser address bar, then log in with your router credentials (these should be marked on the router itself unless you&#39;ve changed them). Go to the VPN tab — which should be there if it&#39;s a router with VPN firmware — and upload the profile you downloaded from the VPN website. Use the same router control panel to activate and deactivate the router VPN connection.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-use-a-vpn-140000564.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2FProton_VPN_for_How_to_Use.png&resize=1400%2C857&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=0c529984e43ef61725fbb498af63e3d5ae932277,https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-use-a-vpn-140000564.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-31T14:00:00Z,11,Tech

How to watch the first-ever Lego CES 2026 press conference live,"picture alliance via Getty Images
The Lego Group is hosting its first-ever press conference at CES 2026 – but what the company is going to announce remains a mystery. While the huge toy brick creators haven&#39;t given any hints as to what they&#39;ll be showcasing, the possibilities run the gamut from new video games to Formula 1 race cars.
Here&#39;s how you can watch Lego&#39;s presentation at CES, and what we might expect to see.
How to watch The Lego Group&#39;s CES 2026 press conference
The Lego CES press conference is scheduled for Monday, January 5 at 1PM ET. While Lego and the Consumer Technology Association haven&#39;t yet provided the details, we expect that the press conference will be available as a livestream. Once the details are confirmed, we&#39;ll update this post to confirm them. But if a livestream isn&#39;t immediately available, the Engadget team will be liveblogging the Lego presser and posting timely details.
What to expect
Thus far, Lego hasn&#39;t shared any public info about its CES plans, so we&#39;re largely in the dark as to what to expect. At CES 2025, for instance, the toy production giant partnered with Sony to announce the animated Lego Horizon Adventures online game. As such, Lego may spend some time talking up its new 2026 game, Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight. The company may also give some stage time to its Lego Group F1 Academy racing car, though that too would be more about brand building than consumer products.
And given Lego&#39;s focus on the environment, the company may discuss its efforts to reach its 2032 ecological goals, including making its Lego bricks more sustainable and reducing carbon emissions by 37%.
While there are plenty of new Lego sets for 2026, however, this is CES, not Toy Fair. So we&#39;re assuming that the company will be showcasing something that&#39;s more tech-centric. Stay tuned.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/how-to-watch-the-first-ever-lego-ces-2026-press-conference-live-130005307.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2Fced0c170-dd13-11f0-b394-1dea3c7b6af3&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=86159cb528f5036b9bd7c790e666f19ff864d7ec,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/how-to-watch-the-first-ever-lego-ces-2026-press-conference-live-130005307.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-31T13:00:05Z,8,Tech

The best cameras for 2026,"Choosing a camera is not just about resolution or price. It is about finding something that matches how you like to shoot. Some photographers want a compact mirrorless camera that travels easily. Others want an action cam that can handle rough hikes, or a full-frame system that delivers the best possible image quality. With so many options today, there is a camera built for almost every creative style.We tested the top models across categories to help you decide which one fits your needs. Whether you are filming your first vlog, shooting portraits or capturing fast-moving action, these are the best cameras to help you grow your skills. 
Best cameras for 2026 
Best mirrorless cameras 
Mirrorless is the largest camera category in terms of models available, so it’s the best way to go if you’re looking for something with the most advanced features. Canon and Nikon recently announced they’re discontinuing development of new DSLRs, simply because most of the advantages of that category are gone, as I detailed in a video. The biggest selling feature of a mirrorless camera is the ability to change lenses depending on the type of shooting you want to do. 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  
Best action camera or gimbal camera 
The most important features to look for in an action cam are image quality, stabilization and battery life. GoPro has easily been beating all rivals recently in all those areas, but DJI has taken a lot of its business with the Osmo Pocket 3 gimbal camera. 

  

  
Best compact camera 
This category has fewer cameras than it did even a few years ago and many models are older, as manufacturers focus instead on mirrorless models. However, I’m still a big believer in compact cameras. They’re a noticeable step up from smartphones quality-wise, and a lot of people will take a compact traveling or to events when they’d never bother with the hassle of a DSLR or mirrorless camera. 
Compacts largely have type 1-inch sensors, but a few offer larger options, particularly Fujifilm’s XF-100V. Another popular model, Sony’s XV-1, is primarily aimed at content creators looking to step up. In any case, desirable qualities include image quality, a fast lens, relatively long zoom, flip-out display, good battery life, a high quality EVF, decent video and good pocketability. 

  

  
What to consider before choosing a camera 
Though smartphones get better for video and photos every year, full cameras still have an edge in many ways. The larger sensors in mirrorless cameras let more light in, and you have a wide choice of lenses with far superior optics. Dedicated cameras are also faster for shooting things like sports or wildlife, offer superior video for content creators and create more professional results. 
Sensor size 
There are a few key things to consider to get the most out of a camera. The first is sensor size: in general, the larger the sensor, the better (and usually more expensive) the camera. 
Full frame is the largest sensor size for mainstream cameras, and it’s available on models like the new Panasonic S9, the Nikon Z III and Canon EOS R5 II. At a size equivalent to 35mm film (36 x 24mm), it offers the best performance in terms of image quality, low-light capability and depth of field. But it’s also very expensive and finicky. While bokeh looks incredible at an aperture of f/1.4, the depth of field is so razor thin that your subject&#39;s eyebrow might be in focus but not their eye. This can also make shooting video difficult. 
The next size category is APS-C (around 23.5 x 15.6mm for most models and 22.2 x 14.8mm for Canon), offered on Fujifilm&#39;s X Series lineup, the Canon R10, the Sony ZV-E10 II and the Nikon Z50. It&#39;s cheaper than full frame, both for the camera body and lenses, but still brings most of the advantages like decent bokeh, high ISOs for low-light shooting and relatively high resolution. With a sensor size the same as movie cameras, it&#39;s ideal for shooting video, and it’s easier to hold focus than with full-frame cameras. 
Micro Four Thirds (17.3 x 13mm), a format shared by Panasonic and Olympus, is the next step down in sensor size. It offers less bokeh and light-gathering capability than APS-C and full frame, but allows for smaller and lighter cameras and lenses. For video, you can still get reasonably tight depth of field with good prime lenses, but focus is easier to control. 
The other common sensor size is Type 1 (1 inch), which is actually smaller than one inch at 12.7 x 9.5mm. That&#39;s used mostly by compact models like Sony’s ZV-1 vlogging camera. Finally, action cameras like the GoPro Hero 11 and DJI’s Osmo 3 have even smaller sensors (1/1.9 and 1/1.7 inches, respectively). 
Autofocus 
For photographers, another key factor is autofocus (AF) speed and accuracy. Most modern mirrorless cameras have hybrid phase-detect AF systems that allow for rapid focus and fast burst speeds. The majority also offer AI features like eye-detect AF for people and animals, which locks in on the subject’s eyes, face or body to keep them in focus. However, some models are faster and more reactive than others. 
Displays 
The electronic viewfinder (EVF) and rear display are also crucial. The best models have the sharpest and brightest EVFs that help you judge a shot before taking it. For things like street photography, it’s best to have as bright and sharp a rear display as possible, so it’s easy to see your subject and check focus in all manner of lighting conditions. You may also want a screen that flips out rather than just tilting, too. 
Lenses 
DSLRs and mirrorless cameras let you change lenses, but you&#39;re stuck with what&#39;s built into a compact camera. While that&#39;s great for portability, a single lens means you&#39;re going to sacrifice something along the way. The Fujifilm X100V, for instance, has a fast but fixed 35mm-equivalent f/2.0 lens and no zoom. The Sony RX100 V has a 24-70mm zoom, but it&#39;s slower at the telephoto end (f/2.8) and less sharp than a fixed focal (prime) lens. 
When choosing a lens for a mirrorless camera, you’ll need to consider the focal or zoom length, along with the minimum aperture. Smaller numbers like f/1.4 for a prime lens or f/2.8 for a zoom are best, as they let you work in darker environments and maximize background blur to isolate your subject. However, those lenses are more complex and thus more expensive. 
Video recording 
When it comes to video, there are other factors to consider. Some cameras combine or skip over pixels (line skipping or pixel binning) for video recording, which is not ideal because it can reduce sharpness. Better cameras tend to read out the entire sensor and then “downsample” to improve video sharpness (camera manufacturers don’t often say if video is pixel binned, but will say if it’s downsampled). Another important factor is sensor speed, as slower sensors tend to have more rolling shutter that can create a “jello” effect that skews video. 
In addition, how’s the battery life? How do you like the handling and feel? How long can you shoot before the camera heats up or stops? Does it support 10-bit HDR video? Is there a microphone and/or a headphone jack? (If you record a lot of interviews, it&#39;s preferable to have both.) How&#39;s the video autofocus? All of these things play a part in your decision.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/best-cameras-151524327.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2Fcc7bda70-d44b-11f0-aa97-a3c775658746&resize=1400%2C840&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=de155fd2b97952cf4bf6ac40028e67a96f48c4f0,https://www.engadget.com/cameras/best-cameras-151524327.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-31T10:01:26Z,7,Tech

Equifax Europe CISO: Notorious breach spurred cybersecurity transformation,"
		
					  
						




The 2017 Equifax breach was one of biggest security incidents of the 21st century. A textbook data leak case, the breach impacted more than 147 million people, spawning a number of scandals and controversies, with the credit reporting agency being criticized for a range of issues, from a lax security posture to their botched response.



The high-profile incident has proved transformational for the company. In the wake of the breach, the multinational company has fortified itself and now even provides advanced solutions for risk management, fraud, and compliance.



Javier Checa, the current CISO of Equifax for Continental Europe, is a computer scientist with more than 20 years of experience in senior cybersecurity positions at various companies, including serving as information security director at El Corte Inglés. Checa wasn’t with Equifax when the data breach occurred; he joined three years later. But he did experience the incident, which he describes as “very significant,” from the outside.



As he recalls in an interview with CSO/Computerworld Spain, although “there had already been other similar incidents, for some reason, probably due to the type of customer and consumer information that Equifax handles, it did have a major impact on the industry at that time.” Furthermore, he adds: “While it’s true that in subsequent years there have been much more serious incidents, [the Equifax breach] was a watershed moment in everything related to cybersecurity.”



A quick learning curve



Checa praises the work done by Mark W. Begor, Equifax’s CEO since 2018, and Jamil Farshchi, Equifax’s global EVP, CISO, and CTO, who have led a complete transformation of the company at a time when it was still very badly affected both financially — it had to face $700 million in fines, compensation, and expenses to protect consumers after the data breach — and from a reputational point of view.



A path in which the CEO’s “personal” commitment to adopting the cloud IT delivery model and the strengthening of cybersecurity and trust to make the company a “security leader” have been vital.



“Equifax has invested nearly $3 billion in a complete overhaul of both our technology and security platforms,” ​​Checa says, adding that the change in the company’s IT strategy is “comprehensive”: “Before, the focus was more on technology, while now security is part of everything we do; it’s embedded in all our processes.”



The company’s CISO for Continental Europe explains that Equifax has built its strategy on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and its Privacy Framework, which focuses more on the issue of privacy risks and the protection of personal information.



“Where are we now?” he asks. “We’re in a happy place because we’ve already completed the transformation of our infrastructure to the cloud model.”



Cloud as a new technological axis



Equifax’s $3 billion migration to the cloud, “which had been brewing for about seven years” and which the company says is the largest technological investment in its history, has involved moving more than 300 systems, over 30 product families, and thousands of customers to the company’s cloud platform, Equifax Cloud, in Spain alone.



“Now, in Spain, for several months now, all the applications and products we serve to our customers are delivered from the cloud,” Checa says. The project, carried out with Google Cloud, has not only consisted of migrating workloads, he adds, but “restructuring, reorganizing, and refactoring all our assets to truly become a cloud-native company.”



The impact of cloud adoption on the company’s security strategy has been clear: “My security philosophy isn’t just about defining a framework of controls; security must have a very important technological component directly related to simplicity. Migrating to the cloud has made it easier for us to simplify all the components and the way we develop,” Checa explains.



The European CISO adds that it has been positive for the company to “reduce legacy systems to zero,” one of the biggest problems for companies with a long market history.



“Now we have a live infrastructure whose systems we update and re-platform every month, something previously unthinkable,” he says.



The company has also seen its security processes simplified. “Aligning the cloud transformation with the security changes has allowed us to implement security controls, measures, and processes that are completely aligned with all the new technology we have,” he points out.



360-degree safety culture



“Now, a security culture is part of our DNA as a company,” says Checa, who works within the multinational’s team of 300 cybersecurity specialists.



But “security isn’t just the responsibility of the technology or security team, but of every employee in the company,” he adds. An example of this mindset is that, “as Jamil [Farshchi] often mentions, Equifax was the first publicly traded company whose employees could access a bonus that included security as one of its components; an initiative that other companies have since copied.” With this, Checa asserts, the company conveys the importance of cybersecurity to its entire workforce.



When asked about the foundations of the multinational’s information security strategy, Checa doesn’t hesitate: “Transparency and collaboration are our cybersecurity pillars.”



The first, “a commitment from the CEO himself,” has been key to regaining customer trust.



“In 2017, after the incident, we needed to win back our customers’ confidence. It’s important to remember that at that time the company’s stock price dropped significantly,” the CISO explains. “Having delivered on our promises is one of the reasons why the company’s stock price is now even higher than before the 2017 incident.”



But there’s another kind of transparency, “the kind we demand of ourselves,” Checa continues.



“Jamil always says it’s easy to be motivated [to be transparent] after a security incident, but the challenge is maintaining that focus over time.” That’s why, Checa adds, the company decided five years ago to launch an annual security report “where we truly open our doors and provide information that few companies had previously offered, from indicators of how long it takes us to respond to an incident to the click-through rate in our phishing simulations.”



Information, he says, that has helped Equifax gain in transparency and customer loyalty. Moreover, he acknowledges, “the biggest lesson learned from the incident is the need to be transparent to regain customer trust.”



Regarding the second pillar, collaboration, Checa is clear about its value: “In the new environment of escalating threats we live in, we understand that no one can win this battle alone.”



Therefore, in addition to sharing security information to be more transparent, Equifax publishes its list of controls so that any company can use them.



“We publish our core security not only for the sake of transparency, but so that all companies and governments worldwide can use it — information that has taken us a great deal of effort to develop,” Checa says.



Furthermore, he emphasizes that Equifax collaborates with security agencies such as the FBI and participates in more than 30 security forums. “We share knowledge, collaborate with states in developing their security awareness programs, and have even helped them resolve some security breaches,” he says.

Although the cyberattack on Equifax had an economic motive, the reasons driving cybercriminals today are highly diverse. “With the rise in geopolitical tension, new threats emerge and new actors enter the scene,” explains Checa. These threats, he acknowledges, are “more complex, persistent, and sophisticated,” and the actors “aren’t really seeking short-term financial gain, but rather accumulating resources that will later facilitate other practices related to espionage, influence, and even corruption.”



According to the company’s latest report, with data from 2024, Equifax neutralizes more than 15 million cyber threats every day, which represents 175 hostile attempts every second, a 25% increase compared to 2023. “We have seen a significant increase in attacks carried out with artificial intelligence,” Checa adds.



He reflects that AI “has democratized cyberattacks, and now people with less technical knowledge can carry out more complex attacks.”



Checa also mentions the rise of deepfakes, audiovisual content that appears real but has been manipulated with AI to deceive the audience. “To counter this, we have migrated to an authentication platform that allows employees accessing our services to use other authentication factors, both biometric and otherwise, instead of passwords.”



AI, on the other hand, is also already a defensive weapon, although Checa urges against using it for everything in cybersecurity, or certainly not as the sole option.



“Our strategy is hybrid. AI alone isn’t capable of defending everything, although it’s a great help. But you can’t base all your defenses on a single technology; the more controls you put in different places and the more different types of technologies you use, the better,” he says, explaining that Equifax leverages various signature protection technologies, among many others.



Challenges of a regional CISO



The CISO acknowledges that cybersecurity management at Equifax is an activity handled internally and globally, although supported by local teams.



“My responsibility as regional CISO is to ensure that the company’s security program is properly implemented at the European level and that we are able to adapt to our specific regulatory environment,” he says.



Checa welcomes the EU’s regulatory push in cybersecurity. “The main regulations that affect us are DORA, as financial service providers, and NIS2, and frankly, they haven’t required anything we weren’t already doing; we’ve simply had to adapt certain aspects.”



He acknowledges that the need to comply with regulations means that “many companies with our risk appetite can secure the necessary cybersecurity budgets,” and he points out that the NIS2 regulation has not yet been transposed into Spanish law. “But the delay also means that the transposition is being taken with the importance it deserves,” he adds.



He further argues that regulation has led to senior management now being directly responsible for company security, which has helped place it at the heart of corporate strategy in many companies. “The most important aspect of cybersecurity regulation, beyond the streamlining of processes and controls imposed by these regulations, is its strategic alignment with senior management.”



The executive is pleased that security, especially since the 2017 incident, has a high profile among Equifax’s senior management. “In fact, I, as Equifax’s CISO for Continental Europe, am part of the management committee, where the budget for this matter is decided,” he says.



Regarding the evolution of the CISO role in the market in general, Checa states: “I’ve been working in security since 2003, so yes, I’ve seen a clear change in this function.” First, he recalls, because “it’s a role that didn’t even exist before, and when it emerged, it had a primarily technical focus. Over the years, it has evolved into a more strategic company profile, more closely tied to the business. The CISO must be a communicator capable of explaining the implications of cybersecurity for the business.”



When asked about the relationship CISOs should have with their CIOs, to whom many CISOs report, Checa says: “In my opinion, there should be a certain degree of independence between the CIO and the CISO, but every company is different. In our case, our global CISO sits on the global management committee; we do as well at the local level.” He acknowledges, however, that from a tactical perspective, it’s beneficial to have close ties with the company’s IT department. “But, as I said, the important thing is to analyze each company’s specific circumstances, its risk appetite, and what works best for it.”



Looking ahead, Checa states that one of his biggest challenges as Equifax’s CISO for Continental Europe is “continuing to adapt to regulatory changes and being able to anticipate and adjust to all the new threats that emerge.” He adds, “My greatest commitment to the company is to be a security leader that delivers value and business. To be a differentiator. That’s what truly motivates and concerns me.”



Not forgetting all the work Equifax is already doing — which Checa says he can’t reveal — to be prepared for the post-quantum era: “We have very strong internal initiatives in this regard,” he says.



Checa works, as he explains, “to ensure that security truly becomes a differentiator from a business perspective, and this, of course, involves protecting all the highly sensitive information we have about our clients and consumers.”



He acknowledges that the role of CISO is “very stressful, but also very rewarding, requiring you to give your best, keep learning, and always be prepared for change.” He concludes that this role must be aware that “you can never reach the final state of security with all the evolving threats, technologies, and problems that exist today.”

LG announces new line of xboom speakers ahead of CES,"LG just revealed several new speakers in the xboom line ahead of CES 2026. These speakers are part of an ongoing collaboration with will.i.am from Black Eyed Peas, who is on board as the &#34;experimental architect&#34; involved with &#34;development, design and brand marketing.&#34;
These speakers are fairly different from one another, but they all have AI in common. Each speaker includes an algorithm that automatically adjusts the EQ after analyzing the audio content and the listening space. Many also feature an AI algorithm for ambient lighting, which will adjust the lights to match the song being played.
The xboom Stage 501 is intended for parties and karaoke sessions. It features additional AI that can remove vocals from &#34;virtually any song&#34; and even adjust the pitch. The battery lasts for around 25 hours and can operate while plugged in. The speaker delivers up to 220W of power, with dual woofers and full-range drivers. It boasts a five-sided cabinet design that allows for vertical and horizontal placement.
LG
The xboom Blast is a boombox with a 99Wh battery that allows for up to 35 hours of continuous playback. That&#39;s a mighty fine metric. This is a modern boombox, so it&#39;s designed for durability. There are edge bumpers and a side rope handle for carrying.
LG
The Mini is a tiny doodad that can be placed just about anywhere. It offers ten hours of battery life per charge and a strap for easy placement. The speaker also includes a built-in tripod mount.
LG
The Rock is a, well, rock-shaped speaker that&#39;s larger than the Mini but can still be held in the palm of the hand. The battery lasts for ten hours and the design is focused on durability. It has been tested to &#34;seven military standards&#34; to ensure reliability in &#34;challenging outdoor environments.&#34; This is an upgrade of the pre-existing XG2 model.
We don&#39;t have pricing or exact availability on this stuff yet, though the speakers will be on display at LG&#39;s booth at CES. The company has said that all four of these gadgets will come out in 2026.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/lg-announces-new-line-of-xboom-speakers-ahead-of-ces-010052598.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2Ff474fbf0-e5a4-11f0-bfd7-4d51b3388d74&resize=1400%2C997&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=889659bd7245d3aff340c98417e401a3936d286e,https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/lg-announces-new-line-of-xboom-speakers-ahead-of-ces-010052598.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-31T01:00:52Z,7,Tech
The OneXSugar Wallet is an upcoming retro handheld with a 4:3 foldable screen,"OneXPlayer is quickly establishing itself as a company that isn&#39;t afraid to get weird as hell. (Take, for example, its transforming dual-screen gaming portable.) Its latest venture is another retro gaming handheld that, at first glance, looks like a standard dual-screen model. But the Android-powered OneXSugar Wallet uses a single foldable screen instead.The device was teased via a 54-second video on the Chinese video-sharing platform Bilibili. Retro Handhelds reports that the Wallet uses an 8.01-inch OLED with a 2,480 x 1,860 resolution. (That&#39;s a 4:3 aspect ratio when unfolded.) The video also shows an asymmetrical analog stick layout with a D-pad and four action buttons.OneXSugar FoldOneXPlayer / BilibiGiven foldable phones’ long-term durability concerns, we aren&#39;t necessarily betting on the OneXSugar Wallet being a wise purchase. We also don&#39;t know how much it will cost. (The aforementioned weird dual-screen device retails for a whopping $799.)

IDC warns of major PC market downturn due to memory crunch,"The demand building out AI infrastructure has placed on PC component makers has already led to the death of one consumer-facing RAM brand, but a new report from the International Data Corporation (IDC) suggests it could have an even worse impact on the PC industry at large. In its worst-case-scenario model, the IDC predicts PC shipments could shrink by up to 8.9 percent in 2026 because of the high cost of memory.&#34;Instead of expanding conventional DRAM and NAND used in smartphones, PCs and other consumer electronics, major memory makers have shifted production toward memory used in AI data centers, such as high-bandwidth (HBM) and high-capacity DDR5,&#34; IDC writes. That&#39;s continued to drive up the price of the RAM that is available for PC makers, which has naturally led to them to raise the price of their own products to stay above water. For example, modular PC maker Framework has already had to raise prices on some of its laptops and parts, and says &#34;further cost and price increases are highly likely over the next months.&#34; The IDC says prices could rise by 6 to 8 percent in 2026 if its most pessimistic scenario comes true.The timing of this RAM crunch is particularly ironic because selling &#34;AI PCs&#34; — computers with neural processing units that can run AI models locally — were supposed to be one of the things pulling the PC industry out of its post-pandemic slump. Instead, those computers&#39; larger RAM needs leave them more vulnerable to the effects of the AI industry itself. Computers aren&#39;t the only electronics impacted, either. The IDC says the average selling price of a smartphone could grow by 6 to 8 percent in its most pessimistic scenario, and smartphone shipments could shrink by as much as 5.2 percent. Companies like Apple and Samsung, with cash to spare and long-term supply agreements, could weather these higher RAM prices and keep things consistent for a year or two, according to the IDC. For everyone else, though, the near-term is looking much more expensive, and by necessity, much less adventurous.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/idc-warns-of-major-pc-market-downturn-due-to-memory-crunch-214510197.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2F2025-12%2Fc002b674-626f-4750-915e-a02f3dde61fd&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=65a83012e3a7cccc073d44cff74d97f9cab839a9,https://www.engadget.com/computing/idc-warns-of-major-pc-market-downturn-due-to-memory-crunch-214510197.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-30T21:45:10Z,7,Tech

Hisense will have a livestream available on Monday, January 5 at 1PM ET on its website. We&#39;ll embed the link here once it&#39;s available.
What to expect
With its new hires in place, Hisense is clearly aiming to further polish its brand. Between Fishler and Larsen, the new front office is bringing to bear their experience from such high-powered competitors as LG, Samsung and Beats. And in a recent interview with Tom&#39;s Guide, Larsen emphasized a continued focus on the company&#39;s fast turnaround time from concept to market as a key differentiator for Hisense.
As for actual announcements, while you can expect Hisense to tout its strength in appliances and HVAC systems (really), Larsen&#39;s aforementioned interview specifically calls out the emerging RGB TV space as a focus. We expect this year&#39;s show will be all about explaining the shades of difference between mini and micro LED display technologies, as both Samsung and LG have already thrown down pre-announcement gauntlets on the latter. Will any of them cost less than six figures? Let&#39;s hope Hisense has some good news to share on that front.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/how-to-watch-the-hisense-ces-2026-presentation-live-190040090.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F96e08150-dcf1-11f0-bb9f-44716a4663a2&resize=1400%2C931&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=9604d14ed9ca113312b470aa2f2c0235988a2cad,https://www.engadget.com/home/how-to-watch-the-hisense-ces-2026-presentation-live-190040090.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-30T19:00:40Z,8,Tech

"Samsung unveils its new $200 Galaxy A17 5G smartphone, arriving in January","Samsung will have two new inexpensive mobile devices arriving on the US market next month. The Galaxy A17 5G starts at $199 and will be available on January 7. Arriving on January 8, the Galaxy Tab A11+ will retail for $250. The Galaxy A17 5G has a 6.7” FHD+ Super AMOLED display and is powered by the same Exynos 1330 chip found in the Galaxy A16 5G. The photography setup is also unchanged from last year&#39;s model, with a 50MP main camera, 5MP ultrawide, 2MP macro and 13MP selfie lenses. The base model has 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, but can be upgraded with up to 2TB of additional storage via microSD. Its 5,000mAh battery also supports fast-charging, a feature we&#39;re happy to see becoming more of an industry standard this year. Essentially, this is more of the same from Samsung, but this product line has a solid legacy of decent smartphones that don&#39;t break the bank. Don&#39;t be surprised if this joins our lineup of best budget Android phones come 2026.The other new entry-level device is the Galaxy Tab A11+, which boasts an 11-inch LCD display. The rear camera is 8MP and the front one is 5MP. It has an option for 6GB of RAM with 128GB in storage, or for 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. Like with the Galaxy A17 5G, the tablet can also be juiced up with additional microSD storage. Performance-wise, you&#39;ll top out at 15 hours of video playback on the battery, but fast-charging is also supported here. There are many swankier tablets on the market these days, but if you&#39;re looking for a bare-bones option, this Samsung offering is a solid consideration.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-unveils-its-new-200-galaxy-a17-5g-smartphone-arriving-in-january-184846560.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2FSamsung_Galaxy_A17_5G_and_Galaxy_Tab_A11%2520.jpg&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=8980e9c6d8feaeee1640febd14d229efb1b03fb9,https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-unveils-its-new-200-galaxy-a17-5g-smartphone-arriving-in-january-184846560.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-30T18:48:46Z,10,Tech

Netflix has released a trailer for the Stranger Things finale,"Tomorrow&#39;s the big day, and I don&#39;t just mean New Year&#39;s Eve. The series finale of Stranger Things airs tomorrow, and Netflix has released a trailer for the last episode. We&#39;re given only flashes of the final episode, along with a voiceover of an emotional Jim Hopper telling Eleven he needs her to fight one last time.
It&#39;s just over 1 minute and 30 seconds long, with what appears to be only about 30 seconds of new footage. There isn&#39;t much to go on here, as most of the footage features emotional moments from seasons past. Netflix no doubt is hoping to keep much of the excitement under wraps until tomorrow&#39;s premiere.
Warning: Some spoilers ahead for Stranger Things season 5.
Among the new images we briefly see Vecna, hooked up to the ceiling in his gross cave of power on his other world. There&#39;s also an explosion at what looks like a military site, plus a few more out-of-context flashes of our heroes.
One particularly ominous moment shows Hopper walking around a smoke-filled room with almost zero visibility, gun drawn, when we see what looks to be Vecna appear behind him. We also see Eleven climb back into the sensory-deprivation tank in the Upside Down, presumably to take the fight to the show’s big bad.
The only continuous scene in the trailer shows most of the gang standing atop a radio tower as Vecna&#39;s world moves close enough to collide with the tower&#39;s tip. Dustin lets out a &#34;mother of God&#34; as the so-crazy-it-just-might-work scheme the group cooked up in Chapter Seven appears to be well underway.
After nine years and five seasons, we will finally reach a conclusion for the heroes of Hawkins. The episode premieres at 8PM ET (5PM PT). For those still craving more from the world of Hawkins after the finale, Netflix is releasing a Stranger Things animated series in 2026.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/netflix-has-released-a-trailer-for-the-stranger-things-finale-171204480.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2Fc5589e60-e5a1-11f0-9e6b-90978a24feb8&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=4f6bce9a1b055831f512d8e395155654e66f7fd0,https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/netflix-has-released-a-trailer-for-the-stranger-things-finale-171204480.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-30T17:12:04Z,7,Tech

1Password deal: Last chance to save 50 percent on our favorite password manager,"If cleaning up your digital life is on your New Year&#39;s resolution list, we&#39;ve got good news: 1Password is offering half off its subscription plans (both the Individual and Families plans). That brings the price of the Individual plan down to $24 for a year and the Families plan down to $36 for a year. 
The plans are nearly identical, but the Families plan accommodates five additional people. These discounts are only available to new customers and the prices expire after the year, so set a reminder to cancel or reassess. And you&#39;ll need to act fast, because the offer expires today — Tuesday, December 30.

This provider topped our list of the best password managers, and for good reason. We appreciated the intuitive interface and the fact that it&#39;s available on most platforms, so you&#39;ll never be left out in the cold. These include Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, macOS, iOS, Windows, Android and more.
Subscriptions include industry standard encryption and a &#34;secret key&#34; that only you know on top of a master password. There&#39;s also two-factor authentication and the platform issues alerts when credentials have potentially been compromised.
1Password recently raised prices across the board, but this is still looking to be the best deal for our favorite password manager going into the new year. The only downside here is the one that accompanies many password managers: There is no free version. Obviously, this won&#39;t be an issue for the year, but it could once the plan runs out.

Meta buys startup known for its AI task automation agents,"Meta has acquired an AI startup called Manus — known for its custom research and website-building agents — in a deal valued at more than $2 billion, according toThe Wall Street Journal. It&#39;s reportedly one of the largest acquisitions yet involving a startup nurtured in China&#39;s AI ecosystem. 
Manus arrived in March 2025, shortly after another Chinese AI startup, DeepSeek appeared on the scene. The company (called Butterfly Effect at the time) originally described it as &#34;the first general AI agent&#34; to perform complex tasks autonomously, rather than just generating ideas. It draws from several third-party models, particularly Anthropic&#39;s Claude 3.5 Sonnet and versions of Alibaba&#39;s Qwen. 
Manus is designed to automate certain tasks, like market research, coding, sales data analysis and website cloning and creation. (However, one skeptic called it &#34;a product devilishly optimized for influencers, which is why it exploded so much.&#34;) The company claims that Manu is &#34;already serving the daily needs of millions of users and businesses&#34; and has an annualized average revenue of more than $100 million only eight months after launch. 
Manus laid off most of its Beijing employees this summer before moving its headquarters to Singapore in an effort to expand globally.The company was reportedly seeking a funding round that would have valued it at $2 billion when it was approached by Meta. &#34;Joining Meta allows us to build on a stronger, more sustainable foundation without changing how Manus works or how decisions are made,&#34; said Manus CEO Xiao Hong in a company news release.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/meta-buys-startup-known-for-its-ai-task-automation-agents-140045275.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F94dc2420-e568-11f0-be57-bb6bde45057e&resize=1400%2C918&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=5343b5961a1d47b3688a2108a90d3d50e1ce8fb8,https://www.engadget.com/ai/meta-buys-startup-known-for-its-ai-task-automation-agents-140045275.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-30T14:00:45Z,16,Tech

TCL introduces its own take on a color Kindle Scribe,"Hot on the tail of Amazon&#39;s Kindle Scribe Colorosoft, TCL is introducing its own take on a distraction-free note-taking and reading device. Unlike the new Scribe, however, it doesn&#39;t use E Ink. The TCL Note A1 NXTPAPER is the company&#39;s latest device to use NXTPAPER, TCL&#39;s custom paper-like LCD screen, which offers some of the qualities of E Ink without the limitations.TCL says the 11.5-inch color &#34;NXTPAPER Pure&#34; display on the Note A1 has a 2,200 x 1,440 resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate, which should mean it looks clearer and feels much smoother to interact with than the color E Ink screen used on something like the reMarkable Paper Pro. The tablet supports TCL&#39;s T-Pen Pro for taking notes and drawing on the screen, but also features eight built-in microphones for recording and transcribing audio. The Note A1 also has a 13-megapixel camera for scanning documents, an 8,000mAh battery and 256GB of storage, with the option to access cloud services like Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive if you want it. A diagram of different Note A1 NXTPAPER features arranged in a grid.TCLUnlike TCL&#39;s past NXTPAPER tablets, the Note A1 doesn&#39;t prioritize media consumption — it&#39;s a productivity tool first and foremost. TCL says the device runs Android, but hasn&#39;t shared whether it&#39;ll have access to the Play Store. All the features the company has announced focus on taking notes and using AI to process and organize whatever you&#39;ve written down. The device will also support real-time translation and &#34;handwriting beautification,&#34; among a collection of other AI-powered features. Engadget has reached out to TCL for more information on the Note A1 NXTPAPER&#39;s software. We&#39;ll update this article if we hear back.There will likely never be one “Goldilocks” version of these note-taking devices, but the Note A1 NXTPAPER&#39;s combination of display and microphones does make it an intriguing, if limited, alternative to Boox&#39;s E Ink tablets. Anyone interested in TCL&#39;s new device won&#39;t have to wait long to try it, either. The TCL Note A1 NXTPAPER is available to order now through Kickstarter (with additional bonuses and discounts) and will officially go on sale for $549 at the end of February.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/tcl-introduces-its-own-take-on-a-color-kindle-scribe-140000207.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2FTCL-Note-A1-NXTPAPER.jpg&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=6345c606e515613fefba5586b8b554bedb3eb386,https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/tcl-introduces-its-own-take-on-a-color-kindle-scribe-140000207.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-30T14:00:00Z,12,Tech

How to watch the NVIDIA CES 2026 presentation live,"CFOTO via Getty Images
At CES 2025, NVIDIA spent the bulk of its presentation touting (what else) its leading position in the artificial intelligence arena. But it also spent time talking up new hardware, including its RTX 5000-series GPUs and Project Digits desktop supercomputer (later redubbed Spark). This year, the company&#39;s website says it&#39;s &#34;lighting up CES 2026 with the power of AI.&#34; To that end, NVIDIA is pulling out all the stops at its Vegas installation, promising hands-on demos in its booth at the Fontainebleau, replete with the &#34;latest NVIDIA solutions driving innovation and productivity across industries.&#34;
But don&#39;t worry if you&#39;re not on the ground in Vegas. Here&#39;s how you can watch the livestream of the company&#39;s January 5 press conference, and what to expect from NVIDIA at CES this year.
How to watch the NVIDIA CES 2026 keynote
NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang will deliver a 90-minute keynote at CES 2026. The event will be livestreamed on January 5 at 4PM ET via NVIDIA&#39;s website (and likely on YouTube as well). We&#39;ll embed the link here once it&#39;s available.
What to expect
NVIDIA&#39;s game plan for CES is suitably vague so far, including  &#34;cutting-edge AI, robotics, simulation, gaming and content creation at the NVIDIA Showcase.&#34; It also notes there will be more than 20 demos. Although we&#39;re unsure if all of these will be shown during the keynote, we can at least expect to see them throughout the week of CES.
Given NVIDIA&#39;s sky-high valuation and the fact that the health of the US and global economy seems increasingly linked to infrastructure spending on AI data centers – largely powered by chips from NVIDIA and its competitors — expect Huang&#39;s remarks to be as closely followed by Wall Street investors as technology acolytes, if not more so. Will we get any insight on a successor to the company&#39;s Blackwell chip? A more detailed look at how NVIDIA&#39;s partners are applying AI to real-world robotics? Time will tell, but you might want to keep your stock portfolio in a split screen while taking in Huang&#39;s presentation.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/how-to-watch-the-nvidia-ces-2026-presentation-live-130028065.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2Fb0333b00-dcee-11f0-a993-97c527ebca4b&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=f34aa0a1c841922ff87c5e64b793c7359f363f01,https://www.engadget.com/computing/how-to-watch-the-nvidia-ces-2026-presentation-live-130028065.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-30T13:00:28Z,21,Tech

The Morning After: What to expect at CES 2026,"CES 2026 is right around the corner, and the pre-show hype cycle/ early reveals suggest, yes, there’s going to be an awful lot of AI-powered insert-product-category-here alongside, thankfully, some major announcements from the likes of Intel, Sony and NVIDIA.
Intel is finally unveiling its Panther Lake (Core Ultra Series 3) chips. The first chips built on Intel’s 2nm process could offer a 50 percent performance boost, which is sorely needed amid intense competition. NVIDIA’s Jensen Huang is taking the stage for a keynote expected to feature a lot of AI hype, while AMD’s Lisa Su will likely counter with new Ryzen 9000-series chips and the latest on AI upscaling tech.
LG
Over the years, CES has consistently been the show for TV innovation and heady next-gen displays. This year, we’ll be talking a lot about Micro RGB. LG is introducing a new Micro RGB Evo panel with over 1,000 dimming zones, while Samsung plans to launch a full range of Micro RGB TVs from 55 inches to 115 inches. In 2025, Sony introduced a new RGB LED panel that uses individual Mini LED backlights in red, green and blue to produce even brighter, more accurate colors. The company has trademarked “True RGB,” which could become what Sony calls its spin on RGB displays.
We’ll be covering all the keynotes, press conferences and big reveals in person. And figuring which of the 100s of AI-branded devices and gadgets are worth reporting on.
I’m also taking bets on the most niche celebrity appearance/endorsement at CES 2026. We’ve seen 50 Cent, Big Bird, Martha Stewart, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Guillermo del Toro, Justin Bieber and will.i.am (multiple times), so who will join this pantheon of stars?

Xiaomi’s 17 Ultra Leica Edition smartphone has a manual zoom ring
And a 1-inch sensor, 200MP telephoto camera and 3,500 nit display.
Xiaomi

Xiaomi’s latest smartphone is once again a spec beast. It features a 1-inch sensor 50MP f/1.67 main camera and 1/1.4-inch 200MP periscope telephoto camera. And it also has an interesting new mechanical feature: a manual zoom ring. This surrounds the rear camera unit.
Both the regular Xiaomi 17 Ultra and Leica edition come with a Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 SoC with up to 16GB of LPDDR5X RAM and 1TB of UFS 4.1 storage, along with a 6.9-inch 120Hz AMOLED display that can hit up to 3,500 nits of peak brightness.
But the camera features are the standout elements. The 17 Ultra by Leica adds some very, well, Leica touches: a two-tone finish, red dot status symbol on the front, textured edges and film simulations, like Leica’s Monopan 50 black and white. Xiaomi says the zoom ring “[eliminates] the need for tedious screen taps... and can detect displacements as small as 0.03mm.” It can also be reprogrammed for manual focus.
Xiaomi’s 17 Ultra by Leica and the regular 17 Ultra start at CNY 7,999 ($1,140) and CNY 6,999 ($995), on par with the latest high-end Pixel 10s and Galaxy S25s.

The best iPad cases for 2026,"An iPad is a great all-purpose device, but it also needs protection if you want it to last. A good case can guard against drops, add a stand for videos or sketching sessions and even make your iPad feel more like a lightweight laptop. Whether you prefer something slim, rugged or packed with useful features, there is a case that fits the way you use your tablet.From keyboard folios to minimalist covers with room for your Apple Pencil, we rounded up the best iPad cases that keep your tablet safe without weighing it down. 
Best iPad cases for 2026 

  

  

  

  

  
Why do I need an iPad case? 
It’s almost always a good idea to keep your iPad in a case so it’s protected against hazards and accidents. The best iPads are expensive — even the most affordable model will set you back at least $300 — so you’ll want to safeguard your gear as much as possible. 
iPad case FAQs 
What is the difference between an iPad case and an iPad cover? 
All iPad covers are cases, but not all iPad cases are covers — yes, it’s a bit confusing, but allow us to explain. Most iPad covers are cases that surround the back of your tablet and have a flap that covers the screen, so it provides protection for the body as well as its display. Plenty of iPad cases also have screen covers, but you don’t have to get one with that feature. Instead, you could just get a case that hugs the back of the tablet and nothing else. Those accessories will be marginally thinner and lighter than their cover-toting counterparts, and give your iPad a more svelte profile. 
How often should I charge my iPad? 
How often you charge your iPad will depend on how often you use it. Most iPads will last at least a regular work day with frequent usage, which is one of the reasons why many have opted to use their iPads as laptop replacements. But with heavy usage, like constant video streaming or gaming, will come more rapid battery drain. A good rule of thumb is to charge your iPad when you go to sleep each night, that way you’ll have a topped-up device waiting for you in the morning.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-ipad-cases-to-protect-your-tablet-130033533.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F6138bc00-d447-11f0-bfff-2f2847add4fb&resize=1400%2C840&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=ac5d09791af3ece1973ef8a82744e41720c6f305,https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-ipad-cases-to-protect-your-tablet-130033533.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-30T10:00:36Z,7,Tech

6 cyber insurance gotchas security leaders must avoid,"
		
					  
						




Facing ever-mounting cyberthreats, enterprises are increasingly turning to cyber insurance to address the potentially severe financial damage a successful attack can inflict. Unfortunately, cyber insurance presents its own risks, particularly for cybersecurity leaders who tend to pay more attention to evolving threats than insurance fine print.



Sharon Polsky, president of the Privacy and Access Council of Canada, an organization dedicated to the development of access-to-information, information privacy, and the data protection profession, notes that several common cyber insurance omissions and loopholes can lead to a sense of complacency that can limit or even nullify a policy’s perceived benefits.



Is your enterprise risking its financial foundation with a cyber insurance policy that contains potentially devastating trap doors? Check your policy — and your assumptions about it — for these six common cyber insurance “gotchas.”



1. Assuming cyber insurance covers all risks



In reality, many insurance policies offer narrow definitions, hidden exclusions, or strict conditions that can leave organizations exposed after a breach. “It’s not like an auto liability policy, where every policy provides the same coverage,” says William J. Lindsay III, founder of insurance broker Tri Pack Insurance Services. “With cyber liability, the terms and conditions will differ from one insurance policy to another.”



Before committing to a specific insurer, Lindsay recommends consulting an attorney with experience in cyber insurance contracts. “A policy is a legal document with complex definitions,” he notes. “An attorney can flag ambiguous terms, hidden carve-outs, or obligations that could create disputes at claim time,” Lindsay says. “Once the policy is purchased, and a loss occurs, no changes can be made to fill the coverage gap.”



2. Misinterpreting the fine print about coverage, interruptions, or threats



It’s hardly surprising, but important to remember, that the language contained in cybersecurity policies generally favors the insurer, not the insured.



“Businesses often misinterpret the language from their perspective and overlook the risks that the very language of the policy creates,” Polsky warns. “For example, business interruption coverage that’s limited to interruptions caused by ‘system failures’ might exclude cyber incidents, such as ransomware.” Meanwhile, “threats coverage” might only refer to threats known at the time the policy was issued, leaving new threat types that arrive during the coverage term uninsured.



“Problematically, terminology used in insurance policies — such as threats — are often not defined, leaving the insured enterprise to anticipate that their own interpretation of the term is what is meant,” Polsky explains. “Unfortunately, the presence or absence of a comma, or a definition, is the stuff of litigation.”



3. Overlooking hidden caps on specific loss types



You may believe your policy will cover all cyberattack losses, yet a look at the fine print may revealed that it’s riddled with exclusions and warranties that can’t be realistically met, particularly in areas such as social engineering, ransomware, and business interruption.



A policy with hidden caps creates a false sense of security, says Max Coupland, CEO of Insuranceopedia, a service that enables users to compare insurance quotes. You budget for full cyber coverage, then a claim is denied or dramatically reduced because the loss fell into a sub-limit — a limitation placed on a policy that reduces the amount of coverage available for a specific type of loss, he explains.



To prevent hidden caps, Coupland advises running a table-top exercise with both your broker and security team. “For each scenario ask, ‘Do we have coverage?’ At what limit? Are there any exclusions that could be triggered?’” Then convert the final document into a one-page coverage checklist before committing to the policy.



4. Not aligning your security strategy with the policy’s fine print



If your security isn’t up to the policy’s standards — and that includes things like multi-factor authentication, regular backups, and endpoint detection — your claim can be denied outright, warns Matt Mayo, president and CEO of managed service provider Diamond IT.



Many enterprises believe they’re fully secure, yet when they file a claim the insurer points to the fine print about security measures you didn’t know were required, Mayo says. “Now you’re stuck with cleanup costs, legal fees, and potential lawsuits — all without support from your insurance provider.”



The best way to avoid this trap is to align your cybersecurity posture precisely with the requirements spelled out in the policy. “This means reviewing your coverage before an incident happens,” Mayo says. Also consider using a knowledgeable consultant who can help implement and document the required controls.



5. Falling into the retroactive date trap



The retroactive date clause can be the biggest cyber insurance trap, warns Paul Pioselli, founder and CEO of cybersecurity services firm Solace. “This clause voids coverage for any incident that began before the policy’s start date, even if it’s discovered months later. Given that hackers can remain undetected in a network for over 200 days on average, this loophole can, in some cases, render a brand-new policy worthless,” he says.



Pioselli says that whenever possible, demand full prior acts coverage. “This removes the retroactive date entirely,” he states. “If the insurer refuses, negotiate to push the date back as far as possible — ideally to your company’s founding date.”



Whenever possible, Pioselli advises conducting a comprehensive cybersecurity risk assessment before shopping for a policy. “You must understand your specific vulnerabilities and potential financial impact first, then buy a policy with limits and coverages that match that reality.”



6. Misunderstanding first-party versus third-party coverage



Perhaps the biggest mistake an insurance seeker can make is failing to understand the difference between first-party coverage and third-party coverage, and therefore failing to acquire a policy that includes both, says Dylan Tate, a representative of insurance marketing firm Smart Financial.



First-party cyber insurance refers to coverage for the business’s direct losses and expenses after a cyberattack, such as lost revenue, public relations support, and costs related to the recovery of lost data. Meanwhile, third-party cyber insurance is liability coverage that can step in to prevent a lawsuit or handle the costs associated if a business is sued by customers affected by a data breach. It may also cover upfront payments to consumers, settlements or fines, and damages ordered by a judge.



If an enterprise’s cyber insurance policy doesn’t include both first- and third-party coverage, your organization may be underinsured, potentially resulting in significant — and unnecessary — out-of-pocket costs, depending on the types of losses they experience in the event of a cybercrime, Tate explains.



Many cyber insurance policies automatically include both first-party and third-party coverage, but some insurance companies only offer them separately, Tate warns. “The Hartford, for example, sells multiple cyber insurance products, some of which bundle both coverage types together and some of which include only one or the other, which may be confusing for enterprise insurance shoppers.”



Asking questions is the best way to ensure a cyber insurance policy meets all of your coverage needs before purchasing it, Tate advises. Going over known cybersecurity risks and potential claim scenarios can help an enterprise gain a fuller picture of how a given cyber insurance company can support them if they suffer a cyberattack. “Although potentially tedious, it can be helpful to engage in exhaustive conversations up front to avoid unexpected out-of-pocket costs later on in the event of a claim,” he says.

Patch Tuesday 2025 roundup:  The biggest Microsoft vulnerabilities of the year,"
		
					  
						




Every day has the potential to be a bad day for a CSO. However, the second Tuesday of each month – Patch Tuesday – is almost guaranteed to be one of those days, though with any luck it’s merely troublesome, not catastrophic.



In 2025, however, some of them gave CSOs heartburn: Microsoft issued mitigations for 1,246 CVEs, including 158 rated critical. Forty-one of them were zero days, and researchers at Tenable estimate that elevation of privilege vulnerabilities accounted for about 38.3% of all Patch Tuesday vulnerabilities in 2025, followed by remote code execution flaws at about 30%.



We asked security experts which of those bugs worried them the most. Here’s how they responded.



New tactics and AI change the game



More vulnerabilities were spotted this year than in 2024, says Gene Moody, field CTO at patching automation provider Action1, an upward trend that’s been ongoing for the past five years.



One thing, however, is different: Thanks to the use of AI by threat actors, as well as cunning new tactics, security teams have less time than ever to install patches.



“Attack groups will do things like hold their first attack until the day after Patch Tuesday, because it puts Microsoft on the spot: They would have to release a massive out-of-band update or wait until the next Patch Tuesday,” he said. “So if you are waiting for 30 day or quarterly cycles to patch, you are behind the curve. You are spending weeks to potentially months unprotected, and [with] no excuse to be so.”



“You have to patch what needs to be patched, not just what can be patched,” Moody added. “You don’t have 30 days to do testing, plan down time. You no longer have the luxury of saying, ‘We’re going to push all of this out at once.’  You need to say, ‘I’m going to knock out the ones that are going to kill me first,’ and if you automate this [initial batch], you have more man hours to analyze and scrutinize the rest.”



Take, for example, one of the nastiest holes found this year, ToolShell (CVE-2025-53770), which is actually two chained vulnerabilities in on-premises SharePoint 2016/2019 servers. It allows an unauthenticated attacker the ability to execute remote code. It holds a 9.8 CVSS score, and exploiting it has become a favorite of initial access brokers. 



Scott Caveza, senior staff research engineer at Tenable, described its possible exploitation as a “nightmare scenario … that CSOs will want to avoid at all costs.” But, Moody pointed out, today most large organizations access SharePoint from the cloud. So its CVSS score is only important to those with SharePoint servers in-house.



Watch those lower-scored vulnerabilities



Several lower scored vulnerabilities could have caused serious damage if not quickly addressed, Moody said. These included:




CVE 2025 24993, a Windows NTFS memory corruption issue affecting nearly every Windows system by default, enabled local code execution by an unauthorized attacker;



CVE 2025 24990, a privilege escalation flaw in the Agere modem driver shipped with Windows allowed attackers to elevate to SYSTEM with little effort, and without an actual Agere modem being in use, turning limited access into total control;



CVE 2025 62221, a use-after-free bug in the Windows cloud files mini filter driver, was actively exploited and provided a dependable path to SYSTEM once code execution was achieved. While it required initial access, Moody points out it was a very short path to total control that was easy to execute, with low skill requirements;



CVE 2025 53779, the Kerberos BadSuccessor privilege escalation, threatened domain level compromise by allowing any domain authenticated account to escalate privileges by spoofing tokens within Active Directory environments. In a blog, Action1 director of vulnerability research Jack Bicer called this hole “a gift to ransomware operators … providing an express elevator to domain admin.”




Caveza also drew attention to two escalation of privilege flaws, CVE-2025-24983 in the Windows kernel, and CVE-2025-29824, in the Windows common log file system driver, because both were used with the PipeMagic backdoor to spread ransomware. 



He also noted 




CVE-2025-26633, a security feature bypass vulnerability affecting the Microsoft Management Console (MMC). This was a zero day vulnerability abused by multiple threat actors to deploy malware, including the MSC EvilTwin trojan loader, and has been used with multiple malware variants, including backdoors and infostealer malware;



CVE-2025-33053, a remote code execution vulnerability affecting Internet Shortcut Files. Check Point Research found this zero-day flaw to have been abused by an APT known as Stealth Falcon, which used the flaw to distribute Horus Agent malware.




Look out for Preview Pane attacks



Tyler Reguly, associate director for research and development at Fortra, said CSOs should think about defending against Preview Pane attacks in Windows and Office. Threat actors could have exploited these flaws to run malicious code when an employee previewed a specially crafted file or email.



One example was CVE-2025-30377, which researchers at ZeroPath called “one of the most dangerous vulnerabilities discovered in Microsoft Office” when it was revealed in May.



These kinds of attack “represent some of the biggest risks to organizations,” said Reguly. “Those silent exploits that run as soon as an email is viewed are a potential risk, since most people make use of the Preview Pane. While there may be bigger vulnerabilities that were more impactful that I’m sure others will call attention to, this is the class of vulnerability that I would want to call out and ensure that others are watching for.”



CVSS score ‘only part of a puzzle’



Moody urged CSOs to stop thinking about CVSS as a score and start thinking of it as a means to developing a score; a CVSS score is “only part of a puzzle.”



Most CSOs don’t have the foundational understanding of how vulnerabilities relate to their specific IT environment and concerns, he pointed out. “People tend to chase CVSS [thinking] ‘9.5, bad’. Well, 9.5 is a theoretical bad. It’s a worse case scenario in a lab if you manage to pull it off – but that vulnerability may not even be expressed in your environment. Or it may be in your environment but in a benign way.



“By contrast, the 6.2 may be the most critical one you need to stop right now because it’s on 10,000 forward- facing web servers.”



He urged CSOs to triage vulnerabilities by using the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s (CISA) Stakeholder Specific Vulnerability Classification (SSVC) framework.

LG to unveil a canvas-style TV at CES 2026,"LG will unveil a canvas-style art TV, dubbed the LG Gallery TV, at CES 2026. The new model will be offered in 55-inch and 65-inch variants, and sports a flush-mount design along with customizable magnetic frames.
The Gallery TV uses a Mini LED display and the company&#39;s Alpha 7 AI processor and offers 4K resolution. The new model will also leverage the LG Gallery+ service, a paid subscription with a library of over 4,500 works that users can display on the TV. Users will also be able to create custom images using generative AI or display images from personal photo libraries.
LG says the TV was developed with museum curators, and will feature a Gallery Mode that optimizes brightness and color to show off the texture of displayed artwork. The display will have some degree of reflection handling and glare reduction, though precise details were not shared. The TV will automatically adjust picture settings to maintain an optimal image in response to changing ambient light throughout the day.
This isn&#39;t the first time LG has released an art-inspired TV. It released an ultra-thin OLED model called the LG GX Gallery TV in 2020. It has also released other &#34;Gallery Design&#34; TVs that offer wall-flush mounting in the past, but the new LG Gallery TV with dedicated art-focused features seems like a more direct competitor to Samsung&#39;s &#34;The Frame&#34; or the Hisense CanvasTV.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-to-unveil-a-canvas-style-tv-at-ces-2026-010024691.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2Fdcf85650-e4ed-11f0-bfdb-5a5ec983b19f&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=7bdfdbd250e895b9dedba20c005fa3a5c9e68a36,https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-to-unveil-a-canvas-style-tv-at-ces-2026-010024691.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-30T01:00:24Z,7,Tech

Apple AirTag four-packs are on sale for $65 right now,"Apple keeps most of its product pricing on a tight leash, but we do see the company&#39;s AirTags go on sale pretty frequently. Another cost cut has come around for this item just in time for the new year. Amazon is currently selling a four-pack of AirTags for $65. At a third off the regular cost, that price is pretty close to the record low discount of $63 we&#39;ve seen for these Bluetooth trackers. 

  
AirTags can be useful for people who travel frequently, helping you to keep track of essentials like your passport as well as a way to keep tabs on luggage while you&#39;re on the go. If you do purchase some AirTags, we have some recommendations for useful accessories to go along with them, such as different styles of cases to best attach the trackers to different types of items. These are worth looking over and adding to your shopping cart in order to make the most of the product.  
AirTags have an IP67 rating for water and dust resistance and their replaceable batteries should last for about a year. They can also support Precision Finding, which gives more exact directions to a lost item, when paired with most models after the iPhone 11. Up to five people can share an AirTag&#39;s location, which is helpful for families or large travel groups.

"NASA finally has a leader, but its future is no more certain","After a rudderless year and an exodus of around 4,000 employees due to Trump administration cuts, NASA got what may be its first piece of good news recently. On December 17, the Senate confirmed billionaire Jared Isaacman as the agency&#39;s new administrator. He now holds the power to rehabilitate a battered engine of scientific research, or steer it towards even more disruption. Considering the caliber of President Trump&#39;s other appointees, Isaacman is probably the best candidate for the job. Outside of being a successful entrepreneur, he has flown fighter jets and been to space twice as part of the Inspiration4 and Polaris Dawn private missions. One of those flights saw him complete the first commercial space walk, and travel farther from Earth than any human since the end of the Apollo program.   &#34;Perfect is the enemy of the good. Isaacman checks a lot of boxes,&#34; says Keith Cowing, a former NASA employee and the founder of NASA Watch, a blog dedicated to the agency. &#34;He&#39;s passed every requirement to fly in a spacecraft that American astronauts at NASA are required to pass. He also went out of his way to have a diverse crew, and shove as much science as he could in those missions.&#34; And yet if you&#39;re a NASA employee or just someone who cares about the agency&#39;s work, there are still plenty of reasons to be concerned for its future. When Trump first nominated Isaacman in the spring, the billionaire wrote a 62-page document detailing his vision for NASA. In November, Politico obtained a copy of that plan, titled Project Athena.To some insiders, Project Athena painted a picture of someone who, at least at the time when it was written, fundamentally misunderstood how NASA works and how scientific discovery is funded in the US and elsewhere. It also suggests Isaacman may be more open to Trump&#39;s NASA agenda than would appear at first glance.   When asked about the plan by Politico, one former NASA official characterized it as &#34;bizarre and careless.&#34; Another called it “presumptuous,&#34; given many of the proposed changes to the agency&#39;s structure would require Congressional approval. In one section, Isaacman recommended taking “NASA out of the taxpayer funded climate science business and [leaving] it for academia to determine.” In another section, he promised to evaluate the “relevance and ongoing necessity” of every agency center, particularly NASA&#39;s iconic Jet Propulsion Laboratory, saying the facility and others must increase the “output and time to science KPI.” A lot has changed since Isaacman first wrote that document. It came before the workforce cuts, before the future of Goddard Space Flight Center became uncertain and before Trump surprised everyone by renominating Isaacman. But during his Senate testimony earlier this month, the billionaire said “I do stand behind everything in the document, even though it was written seven months ago. I think it was all directionally correct.”  He did appear to distance himself from some viewpoints expressed in or inferred by Project Athena, however. Isaacman stated that “anything suggesting that I am anti-science or want to outsource that responsibility is simply untrue.” He also came out against the administration&#39;s plan to cut NASA&#39;s science budget nearly in half, claiming the proposals would not lead to &#34;an optimal outcome.&#34;One thing is clear, Isaacman is not your typical bureaucrat. &#34;One of the pitfalls of some prior NASA administrators has been that they&#39;ve shown too much reverence for the internal processes and bureaucratic structure of the agency to the detriment of decision-making and performance,&#34; said Casey Drier, chief of space policy at The Planetary Society, a nonprofit that advocates for the exploration and study of space. &#34;Isaacman has positioned himself as the opposite of that. Clearly, that&#39;s something that could lead to a lot of political and congressional challenges if taken too far.&#34;   Even if Isaacman doesn&#39;t follow through on any of the proposals made in Project Athena, there&#39;s only so much a NASA administrator — even one sympathetic to civil servants working under them — can do. &#34;Once a budget request goes out publicly, everyone in the administration has to defend it. Anything he does will have to be internal and private,&#34; Drier explains. &#34;He never explicitly criticized the administration during his hearing. He&#39;s also coming relatively late in the budget process.&#34;    A lot of NASA&#39;s future will depend on the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which is responsible for implementing the president&#39;s agenda across the executive branch. As a direct result of guidance the OMB issued over the summer, NASA awarded 25 percent fewer new grants in 2025 than it did on average between 2020 and 2024.   &#34;The OMB has added layers of requirements that scientists now have to go through to spend the money they&#39;ve already been allocated. The administration has worked against its own stated goals of efficiency,&#34; Drier said. &#34;Isaacman can&#39;t solve that himself. He can&#39;t tell the OMB what to do. That&#39;s going to be a serious challenge.&#34; Looming over everything is the fact NASA still does not have a full-year budget for 2026. Congress has until January 30 to fund NASA and the rest of the federal government before the short-term funding bill it passed on November 12 runs out. &#34;On paper, the official policy of the administration is still to terminate a third of NASA&#39;s scientific capability,&#34; Drier points out.There are reasons to be cautiously optimistic. Publicly, both the House and Senate have come out against Trump&#39;s funding cuts. And some science missions that were slated to be cancelled, such as OSIRIS-APEX, have been approved for another full year of operations.   What NASA needs now is someone who will, as Drier puts it, &#34;vigorously advocate&#34; for the agency in whatever way they can. It remains to be seen if that&#39;s Jared Isaacman.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/nasa-finally-has-a-leader-but-its-future-is-no-more-certain-201109072.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2F2025-12%2F5b0c5295-e1d2-47f2-9a87-35afc8111c50&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=b570d4e1fb3b10634dcd4da5161e0147f6d186f0,https://www.engadget.com/science/space/nasa-finally-has-a-leader-but-its-future-is-no-more-certain-201109072.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-29T20:11:09Z,10,Tech

How to watch the LG CES 2026 press conference,"LG
For years, LG has kicked off CES press day with the first event of the morning — and 2026 will be no different. The Korea-based corporation is theming its presentation as  &#34;Innovation in Tune with You,&#34; and — if it follows the template of past presentations — it will highlight both the consumer electronics and large appliance sides of its mammoth global businesses.
Like nearly all tech-centric events these days, expect AI to be the binding theme of the LG presentation at CES 2026. Just be aware that, like Apple, LG has its own customized abbreviation for AI: &#34;Affectionate Intelligence.&#34; The company will share &#34;its vision for elevating daily life through Affectionate Intelligence — delivering harmonized and seamlessly connected customer experiences.&#34; In other words, the company is aiming for its devices to become more connected and self-automated than ever. Here&#39;s how you can stream it and what you can expect.
How to watch LG&#39;s CES 2026 presentation
The event will stream live from Las Vegas on Monday, January 5 at 11AM ET. You&#39;ve got a few options for tuning in — watch the livestream on the LG website, the LG Global YouTube channel or the LG Global X channel. (We&#39;ll embed the stream here once it appears on the channel.)
What to expect
LG will show its &#34;portfolio of AI-powered solutions that combine world-class devices and solutions with advanced AI core technologies,&#34; the company said in a press release. That, of course, sounds generic and indistinguishable from what we&#39;ll get at pretty much every other CES press event.
Thankfully, LG has also started providing some more substantive details of its CES 2026 plan. For instance, the company has confirmed that it will debut its first Micro RGB TV, a display with a cutting-edge screen technology with multicolor backlights that should one-up mini LED displays. The size options are 100 inches, 86 inches and 75 inches.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/how-to-watch-the-lg-ces-2026-press-conference-190159378.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F6f089c60-db4f-11f0-ab9d-5c52fd4922f7&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=014dedbd94400951da2d5d0cb359843f14062876,https://www.engadget.com/home/how-to-watch-the-lg-ces-2026-press-conference-190159378.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-29T19:01:59Z,12,Tech

"Co-founder of CD Projekt Michał Kiciński has acquired GOG, the company's game storefront","Michał Kiciński, co-founder of CD Projekt, has acquired total ownership of the DRM-free video game storefront GOG. The digital video game platform was started by CD Projekt in 2008 with a stated mission to preserve &#34;Good Old Games&#34; (hence the GOG acronym). CD Projekt is known for its game studio CD Projekt Red, the developers The Witcher series and Cyberpunk 2077.
GOG said Kiciński bought 100 percent of its shares for PLN 90.7 million ($25 million). The acquisition was fully financed through committed funding secured at the sale’s closing and did not involve the sale of any of Kiciński’s CD Projekt shares.
The storefront will continue to operate independently under its new owner, sticking with its DRM-free philosophy and ongoing work to keep classic titles playable on modern PCs. After the sale, CD Projekt and GOG signed a distribution agreement that will see CD Projekt Red games continue to be listed on GOG.
While the press release for the sale did not list a reason, a report posted Monday under the Regulatory Announcements section of the CD Projekt website states &#34;the sale of shares in GOG is consistent with the CD PROJEKT Group growth strategy, which assumes focusing on the core business of the Company, i.e., developing and publishing video games and related projects based on the owned and new franchises.&#34; The report also describes a &#34;competitive sale process,&#34; implying that Kiciński may not have been the only bidder.
While it seems Kiciński will have a hands-on role in GOG after its acquisition, his current involvement at CD Projekt is less clear. He remains a significant shareholder but is not listed on the company&#39;s Management board or its Supervisory board.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/co-founder-of-cd-projekt-micha%C5%82-kicinski-has-acquired-gog-the-companys-game-storefront-174853415.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2024-11%2F9be725b0-a213-11ef-bff9-d328f20f96d4&resize=1400%2C785&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=7bf5f8c13f223f243d1c45821eac80f12584055f,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/co-founder-of-cd-projekt-micha%C5%82-kicinski-has-acquired-gog-the-companys-game-storefront-174853415.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-29T17:48:53Z,13,Tech

1Password deal: Get 50 percent off plans for the holiday season,"If cleaning up your digital life is on your New Year&#39;s resolution list, we&#39;ve got good news: 1Password is offering half off its subscription plans now through December 30. This includes the Individual and Families plans. 
That brings the price of the Individual plan down to $24 for a year and the Families plan down to $36 for a year. The plans are nearly identical, but the Families plan accommodates five additional people. These discounts are only available to new customers and the prices expire after the year, so set a reminder to cancel or reassess. 

  
This provider topped our list of the best password managers, and for good reason. We appreciated the intuitive interface and the fact that it&#39;s available on most platforms, so you&#39;ll never be left out in the cold. These include Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, macOS, iOS, Windows, Android and more. 
Subscriptions include industry standard encryption and a &#34;secret key&#34; that only you know on top of a master password. There&#39;s also two-factor authentication and the platform issues alerts when credentials have potentially been compromised. 
1Password recently raised prices across the board, but this is still looking to be the best deal for our favorite password manager going into the new year. The only downside here is the one that accompanies many password managers. There is no free version. Obviously, this won&#39;t be an issue for the year, but it could once the plan runs out.

CES 2026: What to expect from tech’s biggest conference in January,"CES is the January trade show where the tech industry kicks off the year with a bevy of new and notable announcements — and it’s less than a week away. The CES 2026 show floor is officially open from January 6 through 9, but the fun kicks off with events on Sunday January 4 and a host of press conferences on Monday. As always, product demos, announcements and networking will be happening at the Las Vegas Convention Center and other hotels all over the city. As usual, Engadget will be covering the event in-person and remotely, bringing you news and hands-ons straight from the show floor.More specific details and pre-announcements are already trickling out as CES approaches, and thanks to the CTA’s schedule we also do know what companies will be hosting press conferences. We’re also using our experience and expertise to predict what tech trends could rear their heads at the show.The CES 2026 schedulePress conferences and show floor booths are the bread and butter of CES. The Consumer Technology Association has already published a searchable directory of who will have a presence at the show, along with a schedule of every official panel and presentation.On Sunday, January 4, Samsung will kick-off CES with &#34;The First Look,&#34; a presentation hosted by TM Roh, the CEO of Samsung&#39;s DX Division, on the company&#39;s &#34;vision for the DX (Device eXperience) Division in 2026, along with new AI-driven customer experiences.&#34; Ahead of that, though, Samsung has already outlined a variety of more specifics.  That&#39;ll be followed by multiple press conferences throughout Monday, January 5. LG is hosting its &#34;Innovation in Tune with You&#34; presentation to share &#34;its vision for elevating daily life through Affectionate Intelligence&#34; at the start of the day, Intel is launching its new Core Ultra Series 3 processors in the afternoon, Sony Honda Mobility is holding a press conference offering yet more details on its first car and AMD CEO Lisa Su will cover AMD&#39;s upcoming chip announcements at a keynote address that closes out the day.On the week of December 15, the CTA added a keynote by NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang to its schedule. The event will take place on January 5 at 1PM PT (4PM ET) and, according to the website, will last about 90 minutes. Based on the description on the listing, the presentation will “showcase the latest NVIDIA solutions driving innovation and productivity across industries.”Finally, on Tuesday, January 6, Lenovo CEO Yuanqing Yang will host Lenovo&#39;s Tech World Conference at the Las Vegas Sphere, using the large and decidedly curved screen to share the company&#39;s &#34;commitment to delivering smarter AI for all by constantly redefining how technology can engage, inspire, and empower.&#34; It’s worth noting that Lenovo is the parent company of Motorola, which still makes phones and foldables that feature AI tools, so it’s possible those devices feature in the presentation as well. Samsung and LG vie for pre-show publicityAs they typically do, some companies have already gotten a head start on the CES news by publicly sharing their announcements in the weeks leading up to January. LG, for example, has said it will debut its first Micro RGB television at CES. While details are scarce, the company’s press release for the LG Micro RGB evo did confirm it has received certifications by Intertek for 100 percent color gamut coverage in DCI-P3 an Adobe RGB, and that it has more than a thousand dimming zones for brightness control. And if PC gaming displays are more your speed, LG will have that covered, too, with a new line of 5K-capable gaming monitors on deck with built-in AI upscaling.But LG’s not just showing off displays. The Korean multinational will also introduce a Dolby-powered modular home audio system and flex its automation muscles with a humanoid home automation robot named CLOiD. Of course, Samsung refuses to be outdone by its hometown rival, and has also released a pre-CES press release document dump. Samsung will be launching its own lineup of Micro RGB TVs at CES, for starters. The company already introduced its first Micro RGB TV at CES 2025, which was a 115-inch model available for a cool $30,000. Next year, Samsung is expanding the range with 55-, 65-, 75-, 85-, 100- and 115-inch models that use the next evolution of the company’s Micro RGB technology. Samsung is also countering LG’s 5K monitors with a 6K model that aims to deliver glasses-free 3D (another long-time CES staple). It’ll be one of several new displays in the company’s Odyssey gaming line.And on the audio front, Samsung has teased several new soundbars and speakers, including Sonos-style Wi-Fi streaming models call the Music Studio 5 and Studio 7.Outside of the formal introduction of new products and initiatives, reading the tea leaves of what was announced last year and what companies are reportedly working on, we can make some educated guesses at what we could see at CES 2026.New chips from AMD, Intel and QualcommCES is frequently the start of a cascade of new chip announcements for a given year, and one of the first places new silicon appears in real consumer products. AMD will likely use its keynote to introduce new versions of its Ryzen chips, including the recently spotted Ryzen 7 9850X3D, which is expected to offer better single-threaded performance, and the Ryzen 9000G series, which could be built with AMD&#39;s Zen 5 architecture. The company might also use its CES stage to go over its new FSR Redstone AI upscaling tech.Intel has already publicly announced that it&#39;ll launch its Panther Lake chips at CES 2026. The officially titled Intel Core Ultra Series 3 chips fit into Intel&#39;s overall &#34;AI PC&#34; push, but are specifically meant for premium laptops. Based on a preview from October 2025, Intel says the first chip made with its 2-nanometer 18A process will offer 50 percent more processing performance than previous generations and for the chip&#39;s Arc GPU, a 50 percent performance bump from last generation.Qualcomm is also rumored to be targeting laptops at the show, building on the work it&#39;s done moving its Snapdragon chips out of phones and tablets and into other types of computers. The company&#39;s Snapdragon X2 Elite and X2 Elite Premium chips should start appearing in laptops at CES 2026, offering a look at the improved speed and AI performance the company promised in 2025.Brighter, &#34;truer&#34; screensAs noted above, Samsung and LG appear to be going all-in on Micro RGB display tech for TVs. Expect that to be a huge buzzword at CES, with Hisense and Sony debuting new models, too.Sony announced a collection of new Bravia TVs in April 2025, replacing the company&#39;s flagship, filling in its midrange options and adding a new budget model to the mix. The star of this updated Bravia lineup is the Bravia 9, which features a QD-OLED panel, but Sony appears to be prepping entirely new display tech for 2026. In March 2025, Sony introduced a new RGB LED panel that uses individual Mini LED backlights colored in red, green and blue to produce even brighter, more accurate colors. In contrast to a QD-OLED, which filters a layer of blue organic light emitting diodes through quantum dots that change color, Sony&#39;s &#34;General RGB LED Backlight Technology&#34; can get as bright as a Mini LED panel without needing an extra filter layer or worrying about OLED&#39;s problems with burn-in. The company has already trademarked the name &#34;True RGB,&#34; which could end up being what Sony calls this new flavor of display if it decides to show them off at CES. It seems entirely likely, because CES is nothing if not a TV show — it’s a sure bet that we’ll see new TVs from the likes of LG and Samsung in addition to Sony. If the company doesn&#39;t introduce new display tech for its TVs, it does have a new 240Hz PlayStation monitor coming in 2026 that it could show off at CES instead.Sony isn&#39;t the only company hyped on bright screens. Samsung is reportedly pushing an updated version of the HDR10 and HDR10+ standards that could be ready to demo at CES 2026. The new HDR10+ Advanced standard would be Samsung&#39;s answer to Dolby Vision 2, which includes support for things bi-directional tone mapping and intelligent features that automatically adapt sports and gaming content. Samsung&#39;s take will reportedly offer improved brightness, genre-based tone mapping and intelligent motion smoothing options, among other improvements.And maybe your future TV won’t need a power cord, either: Displace will be showing off a mounting option that includes a 15,000mAh battery to juice up whatever giant TV screen you choose to attach.Ballie Watch 2026The ball-shaped yellow robot lovingly known as &#34;Ballie&#34; has been announced twice, first in 2020 and then again in 2024 with a projector in tow. Samsung said Ballie would go on sale in 2025 at CES last year and then shared in April 2025 that Ballie would ship this summer with Google&#39;s Gemini onboard. But it&#39;s nearly 2026, and Ballie is nowhere to be seen. It&#39;s possible Samsung could make a third attempt at announcing its robot at CES 2026, but whether or not it does, robotics will still be a big part of the show.Robot vacuums and mops were a major highlight of CES 2025, and it&#39;s safe to expect notable improvements from the new models that are announced at CES 2026. Not every company will adopt the retractable arm of the Roborock Saros Z70, but robot vacuums with legs for rising over small ledges like the Dreame X50 seem like they could become the norm. Roborock could also show off its new Roborock Qrevo Curv 2 Flow, the first of its robot vacuums to feature a retractable roller mop.Beyond just traversing spaces more efficiently, improving robots&#39; navigation could also be a major concern at the show. Prominent members of the AI industry are turning their attention from large language models to world models, which aim to give AI a deep understanding of physical space. Those world models could be the key to making robots — like LG’s aforementioned CLOiD — competent at navigating homes and workplaces, and will likely be a significant talking point at CES 2026.We’ll be updating this article throughout the month as more rumors surface and new products are confirmed — stay tuned for future updates!Update, December 11 2025, 11:03AM ET: This story has been updated to include detail on Lenovo being Motorola’s parent company and how the latter might have a part in the Tuesday presentation.Update, December 16 2025, 1:33PM ET: This story has been updated to include the NVIDIA press conference, which was added to the CTA schedule within the last two days.Update, December 23 2025, 7:28AM ET: This story has been updated to include LG and Samsung’s Micro RGB TV announcements, which were made public in the past seven days.

Rainbow Six Siege servers are back online after shutting down in response to Marketplace hacks,"Ubisoft had to shut down Rainbow Six Siege&#39;s servers and roll back transactions, a situation that came from a widespread breach that left various players with billions of in-game credits, ultra-rare skins of weapons, and banned accounts. As of Sunday, December 28, the status page on Rainbow Six Siege&#39;s website still shows &#34;unplanned outage&#34; on all servers across PC, PlayStation and Xbox.Later that evening, though, the company confirmed that it was done testing on the update it pushed out and was opening the severs back up to players. It also said that the transaction rollback was complete, but that the Marketplace would remain closed for the time being.➡️ Our live tests are now complete and we are opening the game to all players. Please note that you may experience a queue when connecting, as our services ramp up. ➡️ The rollback is also complete.🔸 Players who did not log in between December 27th 10:49 UTC and December 29th… https://t.co/mfaAVnvK5G— Rainbow Six Siege X (@Rainbow6Game) December 29, 2025
 

The fiasco began Saturday morning when Ubisoft said on X that they were &#34;aware of an incident currently affecting Rainbow Six Siege&#34; and &#34;working on a resolution.&#34; A couple of hours later, the Rainbow Six Siege servers were shut down, following plenty of user reports showing either zero or billions in R6 credits, rare skins in their lockers and either account bans or unbans. Ubisoft later clarified Saturday afternoon on X that nobody would be banned if they spent their ill-gotten credits, but that a rollback of all transactions starting from Saturday, 6AM ET would soon be underway.On Sunday afternoon, Ubisoft informed the playerbase that they&#39;re currently performing a rollback, but that &#34;extensive quality control tests will be executed to ensure the integrity of accounts and effectiveness of changes.&#34; The company added that &#34;this matter is being handled with extreme care and therefore, timing cannot be guaranteed&#34; and didn&#39;t provide an estimate for when servers would be back online.Update, December 29, 2025, 10:22AM ET: This story and its headline have been updated with the details about Ubisoft re-opening the game’s servers.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/rainbow-six-siege-servers-are-back-online-after-shutting-down-in-response-to-marketplace-hacks-191049079.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F50fd7350-e41c-11f0-97ed-30a1f41e5444&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=3cd1f953f675796cd3fc6c4b106aca0d63ce87ff,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/rainbow-six-siege-servers-are-back-online-after-shutting-down-in-response-to-marketplace-hacks-191049079.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-29T15:22:54Z,11,Tech

Samsung plans to integrate Google Photos into its TVs,"Samsung has announced that it &#34;aims to be the first&#34; to natively integrate Google Photos into TVs. The aim is for Google Photos to work seamlessly with Vision AI Companion, Samsung&#39;s souped-up version of Bixby. This would help to make user photos part of the day-to-day TV experience, with photos appearing while navigating the TV&#39;s OS during &#34;contextual and convenient moments.&#34;
The company says users will be able to explore their Google Photos libraries in three new experiences. The first is called Memories, and will show curated stories based on &#34;people, locations and meaningful moments.&#34; This has a planned launch in March 2026 and will be exclusive to Samsung TVs for six months.
Create with AI will use Google DeepMind&#39;s image generation and editing model, enabling users to transform their photos using AI using themed templates. Users will also be able to turn any still image into a short video using the tool. Create with AI has a planned launch in the second half of 2026.
Finally, Personalized Results will create themed slideshows of users&#39; photos based on particular topics or the content of an image. Examples given by Samsung include the ocean, hiking and Paris. This also has a planned launch in the latter part of 2026.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/samsung-plans-to-integrate-google-photos-into-its-tvs-132739713.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-06%2F322f9cc0-4d57-11f0-b6af-becf5173d211&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=65989c6c68acc278f3bae1a8e5012da929c11783,https://www.engadget.com/home/samsung-plans-to-integrate-google-photos-into-its-tvs-132739713.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-29T13:27:39Z,7,Tech

How to watch the Sony Afeela CES 2026 press conference,"
Longtime CES observers know that Sony&#39;s press conference is the traditional capper to the press day that precedes the show floor&#39;s official opening the following day. And while that appears to be the same for 2026, there&#39;s a twist: Instead of an overview of Sony&#39;s electronics, video game and Hollywood studio plans for the new year, the presser will apparently have a more narrow focus: electric vehicles. Apparently the full event will be focused on two vehicles from Sony Honda Mobility — the Afeela 1 car that has made repeat appearances at CES, as well as an all-new concept model at the event.
How to watch the Sony Afeela CES 2026 press conference
The event will be streamed live from Las Vegas on Monday, January 5 at 8PM ET via the Afeela official YouTube channel. (We&#39;ll embed the stream here once it appears on the channel.)
What to expect from Sony Afeela at CES
What&#39;s now the Afeela 1 has been shown in various incarnations since CES 2020, where it was originally announced as Vision-S. But so many more important details were confirmed in the past couple of years, including the price, which starts at a staggering $89,900. However, the earlier impressions were less than impressive, and as of CES 2025, that thought remains the same. Engadget&#39;s automotive expert Tim Stevens said earlier this year that the EV &#34;feels like a PlayStation 4 in the PS5 era,&#34; and that &#34;the car lost what little interesting styling it had while sticking true to some specifications that sounded good five years ago.&#34; Ouch.
But the Afeela 1 won&#39;t be the only vehicle on display. Its CES booth will showcase &#34;several Afeela 1 pre-production vehicles in multiple color variations, alongside a new Afeela concept model,&#34; Sony Honda Mobility said in a press release.
We&#39;re hoping to hear about what&#39;s new and improved at CES 2026, and we&#39;re also excited to see its newest concept model. And between booth displays and press releases, we&#39;re hoping we&#39;ll get to see at least a few new Sony Electronics products on the docket for 2026, too.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/how-to-watch-the-sony-afeela-ces-2026-press-conference-130048921.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F3f099890-d9ef-11f0-a3f3-bb8a02df8254&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=79186135ced099dc039e40ac5680ec450d04f68c,https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/how-to-watch-the-sony-afeela-ces-2026-press-conference-130048921.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-29T13:00:48Z,7,Tech

React2Shell: Anatomy of a max-severity flaw that sent shockwaves through the web,"
		
					  
						




The React 19 library for building application interfaces was hit with a remote code vulnerability, React2Shell, about a month ago. However, as researchers delve deeper into the bug, the larger picture gradually unravels.



The vulnerability enables unauthenticated remote code execution through React Server Components, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected servers via a crafted request. In other words, a foundational web framework feature quietly became an initial access vector.



What followed was a familiar but increasingly compressed sequence. Within hours of disclosure, multiple security firms confirmed active exploitation in the wild. Google’s Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) and AWS both reported real-world abuse, collapsing the already-thin gap between vulnerability awareness and compromise.



“React2Shell is another reminder of how fast exploitation timelines have become,” said Nathaniel Jones, field CISO at Darktrace. “The CVE drops, a proof-of-concept is circulating, and within hours you’re already seeing real exploitation attempts.”



That speed matters because React Server Components are not a niche feature. They are embedded into default React and Next.js deployments across enterprise environments, meaning organizations inherited this risk simply by adopting mainstream tooling.



Different reports add new signals



While researchers agreed on the root cause, multiple individual reports have emerged, sharpening the overall picture.



For instance, early analysis by cybersecurity firm Wiz demonstrated how easily an unauthenticated input can traverse the React Server Components pipeline and reach dangerous execution paths, even in clean, default deployments. Unit 42 has expanded on this by validating exploit reliability across environments and emphasizing the minimal variation attackers needed to succeed.



Google and AWS have added operational context by confirming exploitation by multiple threat categories, including state-aligned actors, shortly after disclosure. That validation moved React2Shell out of the “potentially exploitable” category and into a confirmed active risk.



A report from Huntress has shifted focus by documenting post-exploitation behavior. Rather than simple proof-of-concept shells, attackers were observed deploying backdoors and tunneling tools, signalling that React2Shell was already being used as a durable access vector rather than a transient opportunistic hit, the report noted.



However, not all findings amplified urgency. Patrowl’s controlled testing showed that some early exposure estimates were inflated due to version-based scanning and noisy detection logic.



Taken together, the research painted a clearer, more mature picture within days (not weeks) of disclosure.



What the research quickly agreed on



Across early reports from Wiz, Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42, Google AWS, and others, there was a strong alignment on the core mechanics of React2Shell. Researchers independently confirmed that the flaw lives inside React’s server-side rendering pipeline and stems from unsafe deserialization in the protocol used to transmit component data between client and server.



Multiple teams confirmed that exploitation does not depend on custom application logic. Applications generated using standard tools were vulnerable by default, and downstream frameworks such as Next.js inherited the issue rather than introducing it independently. That consensus reframed React2Shell from a “developer mistake” narrative into a framework-level failure with systemic reach.



This was the inflection point. If secure-by-design assumptions no longer hold at the framework layer, the defensive model shifts from “find misconfigurations” to “assume exposure.”



Speed-to-exploit as a defining characteristic



One theme that emerged consistently across reports was how little time defenders had to react. Jones said Darktrace’s own honeypot was exploited in under two minutes after exposure, strongly suggesting attackers had automated scanning and exploitation workflows ready before public disclosure. “Threat actors already had scripts scanning for the vulnerability, checking for exposed servers, and firing exploits without any humans in the loop,” he said.



Deepwatch’s Frankie Sclafani framed this behavior as structural rather than opportunistic. The rapid mobilization of multiple China-linked groups, he noted, reflected an ecosystem optimized for immediate action. In that model, speed-to-exploit is not a secondary metric but a primary measure of operational readiness. “When a critical vulnerability like React2Shell is disclosed, these actors seem to execute pre-planned strategies to establish persistence before patching occurs,” he said.



This matters because it undercuts traditional patch-response assumptions. Even well-resourced enterprises rarely patch and redeploy critical systems within hours, creating an exposure window that attackers now reliably expect.



What exploitation looked like in practice



Almost immediately after the December 3 public disclosure of React2Shell, active exploitation was observed by multiple defenders. Within hours, automated scanners and attacker tools probed internet-facing React/Next.js services for the flaw.



Threat intelligence teams confirmed that China-nexus state-aligned clusters, including Earth Lumia and Jackpot Panda, were among the early actors leveraging the defect to gain server access and deploy follow-on tooling. Beyond state-linked activity, reports from Unit42 and Huntress detailed campaigns deploying Linux backdoors, reverse proxy tunnels, cryptomining kits, and botnet implants against exposed targets. This was a sign that both espionage and financially motivated groups are capitalizing on the bug.



Data from Wiz and other responders indicates that dozens of distinct intrusion efforts have been tied to React2Shell exploitation, with compromised systems ranging across sectors and regions. Despite these confirmed attacks and public exploit code circulating, many vulnerable deployments remain unpatched, keeping the window for further exploitation wide open.



The lesson React2Shell leaves behind



React2Shell is ultimately less about React than about the security debt accumulating inside modern abstractions. As frameworks take on more server-side responsibility, their internal trust boundaries become enterprise attack surfaces overnight.



The research community mapped this vulnerability quickly and thoroughly. Attackers moved even faster. For defenders, the takeaway is not just to patch, but to reassess what “default safe” really means in an ecosystem where exploitation is automated, immediate, and indifferent to intent.



React2Shell is rated critical, carrying a CVSS score of 10.0, reflecting its unauthenticated remote code execution impact and broad exposure across default React Server Components deployments. React maintainers and downstream frameworks such as Next.js have released patches, and researchers broadly agree that affected packages should be updated immediately.



Beyond patching, they warn that teams should assume exploitation attempts may already be underway. Recommendations consistently emphasize validating actual exposure rather than relying on version checks alone, and actively hunting for post-exploitation behavior such as unexpected child processes, outbound tunneling traffic, or newly deployed backdoors. The message across disclosures is clear: React2Shell is not a “patch when convenient” flaw, and the window for passive response has already closed.

What to look for in a wireless charger 
While it’s tempting to buy a wireless charging pad optimized for the specific phone you have now, resist that urge. Instead, think about the types of devices (phones included) that you could see yourself using in the near future. If you’re sure you’ll use iPhones for a long time, an Apple MagSafe-compatible magnetic wireless charger will be faster and more convenient. If you use Android phones or think you might switch sides, however, you’ll want a more universal design. If you have other accessories like wireless earbuds or a smartwatch that supports wireless charging, maybe you’d be better off with a 3-in-1 wireless charger or full wireless charging station. 
Where and how will you use your charger? 

 
 
 
Odds are that you have a specific use case in mind for your charger. You may want it by your bedside on your nightstand for a quick charge in the morning, or on your desk for at-a-glance notifications. You might even keep it in your bag for convenient travel charging instead of bulky portable chargers or power banks. Think about where you want to use this accessory and what you want to do with the device(s) it charges while it’s powering up. For example, a wireless charging pad might be better for bedside use if you just want to be able to drop your phone down at the end of a long day and know it’ll be powered up in the morning. However, a stand will be better if you have an iPhone and want to make use of the Standby feature during the nighttime hours. 
For a desk wireless charger, a stand lets you more easily glance at phone notifications throughout the day. For traveling, undoubtedly, a puck-style charging pad is best since it will take up much less space in your bag than a stand would. Many power banks also include wireless charging pads built in, so one of those might make even more sense for those who are always on the go. Some foldable chargers are also designed for travel, collapsing flat to take up less space. 
Wireless charging performance 
Although wireless charging is usually slower than its wired equivalent, speed and wattage are still important considerations. A fast charger can supply enough power for a long night out in the time it takes to change outfits. Look for options that promise faster charging and support standards like Qi2 certified charging for the best balance of efficiency and compatibility. 
In general, a 15W charger is more than quick enough for most situations, and you’ll need a MagSafe-compatible charger to extract that level of performance from an iPhone. With that said, even the slower 7.5W and 10W chargers are fast enough for an overnight power-up. If anything, you’ll want to worry more about support for cases. While many models can deliver power through a reasonably thick case (typically 3mm to 5mm), you’ll occasionally run into examples that only work with naked phones. 
There are some proprietary chargers that smash the 15W barrier if you have the right phone. Apple’s latest MagSafe charging pad can provide up to 25W of wireless power to compatible iPhones when paired with a 30W or 35W adapter — the latter being another component you’ll have to get right to make sure the whole equation works as fast as it possibly can. 
Quality and box contents 

 
 
 
Pay attention to what’s included in the box. Some wireless chargers don’t include power adapters, and others may even ask you to reuse your phone’s USB-C charging cable. What may seem to be a bargain may prove expensive if you have to buy extras just to use it properly. As mentioned above, you’ll want to make sure all of the components needed to use the wireless charger can provide the level of power you need — you’re only as strong (or in this case, fast) as your weakest link. 
Fit and finish is also worth considering. You’re likely going to use your wireless charger every day, so even small differences in build quality could make the difference between joy and frustration. If your charger doesn’t use MagSafe-compatible tech, textured surfaces like fabric or rubberized plastic are more likely to keep your phone in place. The base should be grippy or weighty enough that the charger won’t slide around. Also double check that the wireless charger you’re considering can support phones outfitted with cases — the specifications are usually listed in the charger’s description or specs. 
You’ll also want to think about the minor conveniences. Status lights are useful for indicating correct phone placement, but an overly bright light can be distracting. Ideally, the light dims or shuts off after a certain period of time. And while we caution against lips and trays that limit compatibility, you may still want some barriers to prevent your device falling off its perch on the charging station. 
Wireless chargers FAQs 
Do wireless chargers work if you have a phone case? 
Many wireless chargers do work if you leave the case on your phone. Generally, a case up to 3mm thick should be compatible with most wireless chargers. However, you should check the manufacturer’s guide to ensure a case is supported. 
How do I know if my phone supports wireless charging? 
Checking the phone’s specification should tell you if your phone is compatible with wireless charging. You might see words like “Qi wireless charging” or “wireless charging compatible.” 
Do cords charge your phone faster? 
Most often, wired charging will be faster than wireless charging. However, wired charging also depends on what the charging cable’s speed is and how much power it’s designed to carry. A quick-charging cable that can transmit up to 120W of power is going to be faster than a wireless charger.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-wireless-charger-140036359.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F1d885fe0-d769-11f0-b17a-040e2b47e430&resize=1400%2C840&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=76d1fb983b56b952a91fb8bfbff84f7389515542,https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-wireless-charger-140036359.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-29T08:00:36Z,8,Tech

Top 5 real-world AI security threats revealed in 2025,"
		
					  
						




The year of agentic AI came with promises of massive productivity gains for businesses, but the rush to adopt new tools and services also opened new attack paths in enterprise environments.



Here are some of the top security risks to the AI ecosystem that were revealed this year by security researchers, either in the wild or as researcher-demonstrated attacks.



Shadow AI and vulnerable AI tools



Giving free reign to employees to experiment with AI tools to automate business processes might sound like a good idea that could surface creative solutions. But it can quickly get out of control if not done under a strict policy and monitoring.



A recent survey of 2,000 employees from companies in the US and UK revealed that 49% use AI tools not sanctioned by their employers and that over half do not understand how their inputs are stored and analyzed by these tools.



The deployment of all AI-related tools and services on premises or in the cloud needs to involve the security team in order to catch insecure configurations or known vulnerabilities.



In its 2025 State of Cloud Security report, Orca Security reported that 84% of organizations now use AI-related tools in the cloud and that 62% had at least one vulnerable AI package in their environments.



A separate report from the Cloud Security Alliance reported that one third of organizations experienced a cloud data breach that involved an AI workload, with 21% of those incidents caused by vulnerabilities, 16% by misconfigured security settings, and 15% by compromised credentials or weak authentication.



Even the AI tools released by major vendors regularly have vulnerabilities identified and patched in them. Examples this year include:




A critical remote code execution (RCE) in open-source AI agent framework Langflow that was also exploited in the wild



An RCE flaw in OpenAI’s Codex CLI



Vulnerabilities in NVIDIA Triton Inference Server



RCE vulnerabilities in major AI inference server frameworks, including those from Meta, Nvidia, Microsoft, and open-source projects such as vLLM and SGLang



Vulnerabilities in open-source compute framework Ray




AI supply chain poisoning



Companies that are developing software with AI-related libraries and frameworks need to be aware that their developers might be targeted. Vetting the source of AI models and development packages is vital.



This year security researchers from ReversingLabs found malware hidden in AI models hosted on Hugging Face, the largest online hosting database for open-source models and other machine learning assets. Separately, they also found trojanized packages on the Python Package Index (PyPI) posing as SDKs for interacting with AI cloud services from Aliyun AI Labs, Alibaba Cloud’s AI research arm.



In both cases, the attackers exploited the Pickle object serialization format to hide their code, a Python format that is commonly used to store AI models meant to be used with PyTorch, one of the most popular machine learning libraries.



AI credential theft



Attackers are also adopting AI for their operations and would prefer to do so without paying and in other people’s names. The theft of credentials that can be used to access LLMs through official APIs or services such as Amazon Bedrock is now prevalent and has even received a name: LLMjacking.



This year Microsoft filed a civil lawsuit against a gang that specialized in stealing LLM credentials and using them to build paid services for other cybercriminals to generate content that bypassed the usual built-in ethical safeguards.



Large quantities of API calls to LLMs can rack up significant costs for the owners of stolen credentials, with researchers estimating potential costs of over $100,000 per day when querying cutting-edge models.



Prompt injections



AI tools also come with entirely new types of security vulnerabilities, the most common of which is known as prompt injection and stems from the fact that it is very hard to control what LLMs interpret as instructions to execute or as passive data to analyze. By design there is no distinction, as LLMs don’t interpret language and intent like humans do.



This leads to scenarios where data passed to an LLM from a third-party source — for example in the form of a document, an incoming email, a web page, and so on — could contain text that the LLM will execute as a prompt. This is known as indirect prompt injection and is a major problem in the age of AI agents where LLMs are linked with third-party tools to be able to access data for context or to perform tasks.



This year researchers demonstrated prompt injection attacks in AI coding assistants such as GitLab Duo, GitHub Copilot Chat; AI agent platforms like ChatGPT, Copilot Studio, Salesforce Einstein; AI-enabled browsers such as Perplexity’s Comet, Microsoft’s Copilot for Edge, and Google’s Gemini for Chrome; chatbots like Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Microsoft Copilot; and more.



These attacks can at the very least lead to sensitive data exfiltration, but can also trick the AI agent to perform other rogue tasks using the tools at its disposal, including potentially malicious code execution.



Prompt injections are a risk for all custom AI agents built by organizations that pass third-party data to an LLM and mitigating it requires a multi-layered approach as no defense is perfect. This includes forcing context separation by splitting different tasks to different LLM instances and employing the principle of least privilege for the agent or the tools it has access to, taking a human-in-the-loop approach for approving sensitive operations, filtering input for text strings that are commonly used in prompt injections, using system prompts to instruct the LLM to ignore commands from ingested data, using structured data formats, and more.



Rogue and vulnerable MCP servers



The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has become a standard for how LLMs interact with external data sources and applications to improve their context for reasoning. The protocol has seen rapid adoption and is a key component in developing AI agents, with tens of thousands of MCP servers now published online.



An MCP server is the component that allows an application to expose its functionality to an LLM through a standardized API and an MCP client is the component through which that functionality gets accessed. Integrated development environments (IDEs) such as Microsoft’s Visual Studio Code or those based on it, like Cursor and Antigravity, natively support integration with MCP servers and command-line-interface tools such as Claude Code CLI can also access them.



MCP servers can be hosted and downloaded from anywhere, for example GitHub, and they can contain malicious code. Researchers recently showed how a rogue MCP server could inject malicious code into the built-in browser from Cursor IDE.



However, MCP servers don’t necessarily have to be intentionally rogue to be a security threat. Many MCP servers can have vulnerabilities and misconfigurations and can open a path to OS command injection. The communication between MCP clients and MCP servers is also not always secure and can be exposed to an attack called prompt hijacking where attackers can get access to servers by guessing session IDs.

Apple escalates its appeal of a $2 billion fine from a UK antitrust lawsuit,"Apple isn&#39;t ready to pay a several billion-dollar fine to UK App Store users and is filing an appeal over a major antitrust lawsuit. As first reported by The Guardian, Apple has requested to appeal to the UK&#39;s Court of Appeal, which would escalate the case beyond the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT). 
The latest appeal attempt follows an October decision from the CAT, where the court found that Apple engaged in anticompetitive practices by exploiting its dominant market position with the App Store to charge higher fees. The CAT&#39;s ruling established a £1.5 billion, or roughly $2 billion, fine, but Apple said it planned to appeal and that the court &#34;takes a flawed view of the thriving and competitive app economy.&#34; The CAT didn&#39;t grant Apple the appeal, leading the iPhone maker to seek a higher court to overturn the ruling.
Apple hasn&#39;t made any official statements about its latest appeal application, but it&#39;s likely that it will argue against the CAT&#39;s proposed App Store developer fee rate of between 15 and 20 percent, which it reached through &#34;informed guesswork,&#34; instead of the existing 30 percent. If the fine does ultimately stick, the $2 billion fine would be split amongst any App Store user in the UK who made purchases between 2015 and 2024, according to The Guardian.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-escalates-its-appeal-of-a-2-billion-fine-from-a-uk-antitrust-lawsuit-201922558.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2Facb37e60-e426-11f0-987f-990ab8298b70&resize=1400%2C783&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=e4658ec7ce98536321d0851ba9617c37ca8548c0,https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-escalates-its-appeal-of-a-2-billion-fine-from-a-uk-antitrust-lawsuit-201922558.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-28T20:19:22Z,7,Tech

Ubisoft is rolling back Rainbow Six Siege servers after being forced to shut them down,"Ubisoft has shut down Rainbow Six Siege&#39;s servers and is in the process of rolling back the fallout of a widespread breach that left various players with billions of in-game credits, ultra-rare skins of weapons, and banned accounts. As of Sunday afternoon, the status page on Rainbow Six Siege&#39;s website still shows &#34;unplanned outage&#34; on all servers across PC, PlayStation and Xbox.
Update: Siege and the Marketplace have been intentionally shut down while the team focuses on resolving the issue. https://t.co/7k6Jsa5CiM— Rainbow Six Siege X (@Rainbow6Game) December 27, 2025
 


The fiasco began Saturday morning when Ubisoft said on X that they were &#34;aware of an incident currently affecting Rainbow Six Siege&#34; and &#34;working on a resolution.&#34; A couple of hours later, the Rainbow Six Siege servers were shut down, following plenty of user reports showing either zero or billions in R6 credits, rare skins in their lockers and either account bans or unbans. Ubisoft later clarified Saturday afternoon on X that nobody would be banned if they spent their ill-gotten credits, but that a rollback of all transactions starting from Saturday, 6AM ET would soon be underway.
On Sunday afternoon, Ubisoft informed the playerbase that they&#39;re currently performing a rollback, but that &#34;extensive quality control tests will be executed to ensure the integrity of accounts and effectiveness of changes.&#34; The company added that &#34;this matter is being handled with extreme care and therefore, timing cannot be guaranteed&#34; and didn&#39;t provide an estimate for when servers would be back online.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ubisoft-is-rolling-back-rainbow-six-siege-servers-after-being-forced-to-shut-them-down-191049440.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F50fd7350-e41c-11f0-97ed-30a1f41e5444&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=3cd1f953f675796cd3fc6c4b106aca0d63ce87ff,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ubisoft-is-rolling-back-rainbow-six-siege-servers-after-being-forced-to-shut-them-down-191049440.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-28T19:10:49Z,8,Tech

Ayaneo's latest Game Boy remake will have an early bird starting price of $269,"After the high price tag of the Ayaneo Pocket DMG turned some retro handheld fans away, Ayaneo is working on another remake of the classic Game Boy with a slightly more affordable cost. Ayaneo revealed the pricing for the Pocket Vert, which starts at $269 for early bird orders.
Compared to the Pocket DMG that retails for $449, Ayaneo skipped the OLED and configurations that go up to 16GB of memory and 1TB of storage for the Pocket Vert. Instead, the handheld maker went with a fully metal CNC body and an ultra-minimalist design with engraving-free buttons that resemble the Analogue Pocket&#39;s look. Ayaneo built the Pocket Vert with a smaller 3.5-inch LCD screen that has a 1,600 x 1,440 resolution and a Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 chip that should allow the handheld to handle anything up to PS2 and some Nintendo Switch games.
Ayaneo
To play more modern games, the Pocket Vert has a hidden touch pad below the buttons that acts as a makeshift joystick. Ayaneo also hid a fingerprint sensor in the power button and included a USB-C port, a 3.5mm headphone jack and a microSD slot for more storage capacity. The Indiegogo campaign for the Pocket Vert isn&#39;t open yet, but it will be the only place to snag the latest vertical handheld from Ayaneo at its lowest price before it reverts to the retail price of $339. You can even opt for the fully specced-out version that&#39;s only available in Lava Red and has 12GB of memory and 256GB of storage for an early bird price of $369 and a later standard price of $439.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ayaneos-latest-game-boy-remake-will-have-an-early-bird-starting-price-of-269-174553644.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2Fc0d5d680-e40e-11f0-a97e-68430d00d5dd&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=caeed2b24dd9054e45a58e3cefab1be2a1aa16fc,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ayaneos-latest-game-boy-remake-will-have-an-early-bird-starting-price-of-269-174553644.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-28T17:45:54Z,7,Tech

Samsung's two new speakers will deliver crisp audio while blending into your decor,"Samsung is adding two brand new speakers to its audio lineup, along with updated soundbars boosted with AI features. While not as inconspicuous as the Samsung Frame, the new WiFi speakers, called the Music Studio 5 and 7, were designed to blend into your living room&#39;s atmosphere with their minimalist design. However, if you&#39;re looking for a more convenient option, Samsung also updated its flagship HW-Q990H soundbar, while also introducing the more affordable choice of the HW-QS90H.
Samsung built the Music Studio 5 with a four-inch woofer and dual tweeters, pairing them with a built-in waveguide to deliver better sound. To customize the sound, Samsung added its new AI Dynamic Bass Control that can make bass sound better without any distortion. You can even control the &#34;gallery-inspired&#34; speaker via voice or Bluetooth and it&#39;s compatible with WiFi casting and streaming services.
Samsung
For an upgraded option, the Music Studio 7 comes with a 3.1.1-channel spatial audio that has top-, front-, left- and right-firing speakers to give a more immersive 3D audio experience. You can calibrate the sound even further with the Samsung Audio Lab Pattern Control Technology and the same AI Dynamic Bass Control feature seen with the Music Studio 5. Samsung says the Music Studio 7 can play Hi-Resolution Audio with up to 24-bit/96kHz audio processing and can either be used as a standalone speaker or paired with other Samsung audio devices.
Samsung
To round out its new audio offerings, Samsung debuted the HW-QS90H, or its All-in-One Soundbar, with a 7.1.2.-channel system that features 13 drivers, nine of which are wide-range speakers. The new soundbar&#39;s built-in Quad Bass Woofer system means you can achieve deeper bass without a separate subwoofer. The All-in-One Soundbar even features Samsung&#39;s Convertible Fit design that can handle being mounted on a wall or placed on a table, and a gyro sensor that can automatically adapt channel distribution depending on its orientation, like we saw with the QS700F.
Samsung even refreshed its flagship HW-Q990H soundbar this year and introduced to it the Sound Elevation feature that makes dialogue sound more natural and Auto Volume, which regulates a consistent volume across its channels for a more balanced sound. All of Samsung&#39;s latest soundbars and speakers will be on display at CES 2026.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/samsungs-two-new-speakers-will-deliver-crisp-audio-while-blending-into-your-decor-230053770.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F769dc050-e364-11f0-917c-ece877b60c27&resize=1400%2C770&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=579bc90b288160f12a3237357ef5fe4815bc1e2e,https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/samsungs-two-new-speakers-will-deliver-crisp-audio-while-blending-into-your-decor-230053770.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-27T23:00:53Z,9,Tech

OpenAI is hiring a new Head of Preparedness to try to predict and mitigate AI's harms,"OpenAI is looking for a new Head of Preparedness who can help it anticipate the potential harms of its models and how they can be abused, in order to guide the company&#39;s safety strategy. It comes at the end of a year that&#39;s seen OpenAI hit with numerous accusations about ChatGPT&#39;s impacts on users&#39; mental health, including a few wrongful death lawsuits. In a post on X about the position, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman acknowledged that the &#34;potential impact of models on mental health was something we saw a preview of in 2025,&#34; along with other &#34;real challenges&#34; that have arisen alongside models&#39; capabilities. The Head of Preparedness &#34;is a critical role at an important time,&#34; he said.Per the job listing, the Head of Preparedness (who will make $555K, plus equity), &#34;will lead the technical strategy and execution of OpenAI’s Preparedness framework, our framework explaining OpenAI’s approach to tracking and preparing for frontier capabilities that create new risks of severe harm.&#34; It is, according to Altman, &#34;a stressful job and you&#39;ll jump into the deep end pretty much immediately.&#34;Over the last couple of years, OpenAI&#39;s safety teams have undergone a lot of changes. The company&#39;s former Head of Preparedness, Aleksander Madry, was reassigned back in July 2024, and Altman said at the time that the role would be taken over by execs Joaquin Quinonero Candela and Lilian Weng. Weng left the company a few months later, and in July 2025, Quinonero Candela announced his move away from the preparedness team to lead recruiting at OpenAI. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-is-hiring-a-new-head-of-preparedness-to-try-to-predict-and-mitigate-ais-harms-220330486.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2F2025-12%2F2ee5dac2-d430-45f3-b113-d7bcca435c8b&resize=1400%2C816&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=1449d219528f6c53aaa42cdde4a38cf4c9a077c6,https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-is-hiring-a-new-head-of-preparedness-to-try-to-predict-and-mitigate-ais-harms-220330486.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-27T22:03:30Z,9,Tech

Here’s the first real look at the Retroid Pocket 6 running PS2 games,"The Retroid Pocket 6 may have gotten off to a rocky start, but the gaming handheld is officially completed and going to see its first shipments soon. The handheld maker revealed the final product shots of the Retroid Pocket 6 in black and orange on X. Along with in-person product pics, Retroid revealed gameplay videos of its handheld, running emulation of PlayStation 2 games.

For those looking to relive some classic Nintendo or PlayStation titles, the Retroid Pocket 6 offers a great entry point into the retro handheld world since it can emulate games up to Nintendo Switch and PS2. However, Retroid did have some initial blowback about its design and decided to go back to the drawing board. Following the early criticisms, Retroid decided to add an option for customers to choose between having the D-pad or a thumbstick at the top of the handheld&#39;s left side.
Retroid
The problems persisted for Retroid, as the handheld maker had to then cut short the early bird pricing thanks to the widespread memory shortage. Instead of offering the handheld for $209 until January, Retroid removed the discount in late December, leaving new buyers paying the full retail price of $229. However, the internal specs remained the same, with a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor, up to 12GB of memory and up to 256GB of storage that&#39;s expandable with a TF card slot.
Despite the hiccups, Retroid looks ready to start shipments of its latest retro gaming handheld as evidenced by the new photos and videos. According to the website, the first batch of Retroid Pocket 6 preorders are due to start shipping in January. Second bath preoders are still available on Retroid&#39;s website, which are expected to get to customers in March.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/heres-the-first-real-look-at-the-retroid-pocket-6-running-ps2-games-193624145.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2Fad36c090-e354-11f0-b7f2-c3cad2d9f9f3&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=fe56b614dc09121908019c3f5699d14378819be4,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/heres-the-first-real-look-at-the-retroid-pocket-6-running-ps2-games-193624145.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-27T19:36:26Z,7,Tech

Stardew Valley players on the Nintendo Switch 2 get a free upgrade,"Stardew Valley is truly the gift that keeps on giving. Fans of the farm life simulator, specifically those who already own it for the Nintendo Switch 2, can download a free upgrade that introduces new features and multiplayer modes. However, fans have reported some bugs following the free release, and Eric Barone, the game&#39;s developer that&#39;s better known as ConcernedApe, is working on fixes.
If you have Stardew Valley on the Switch 2, you can download the Upgrade Pack that introduces mouse controls to make it easier to place furniture and organize your inventory. The upgrade also adds local split-screen co-op for up to four players and online multiplayer that maxes out at eight players. On top of the co-op modes, the free content pack includes Game Share compatibility, meaning only one player needs a copy of Stardew Valley to share it with three others.
This Upgrade Pack may not have as much content as a numbered update, but some players are already reporting bugs. According to user accounts, the online multiplayer mode isn&#39;t working, while other reports noted that some crafting recipes had inaccurate material requirements or quantities. In a post on X, Barone said that he&#39;s taking &#34;full responsibility for this mistake&#34; and that the development team &#34;will fix this as soon as possible.&#34; On top of addressing the bugs from the latest Upgrade Pack, Barone and the rest of the development team are also working on the upcoming 1.7 update for Stardew Valley, while Haunted Chocolatier  is still under development.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/stardew-valley-players-on-the-nintendo-switch-2-get-a-free-upgrade-174849697.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F4dbd7de0-e348-11f0-b7fb-a4c5652c6d13&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=6887142b5a4c2b2f0eef1fb1d9df364c4f63c922,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/stardew-valley-players-on-the-nintendo-switch-2-get-a-free-upgrade-174849697.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-27T17:48:50Z,8,Tech

New York State will require warning labels on social media platforms,"The State of New York will now require social media platforms to display warning labels similar to those found on cigarettes. The bill was passed by the New York Legislature in June and signed into law by Gov. Kathy Hochul on Friday. It will apply to any platforms that feature infinite scrolling, auto-play, like counts or algorithmic feeds. The labels will caution those on the platform about potential harm to young users&#39; mental health.
Social media companies will be required to display these warning labels when a user first interacts with any of the features the state considers predatory. The warning will also be displayed periodically after that interaction. 
&#34;Keeping New Yorkers safe has been my top priority since taking office, and that includes protecting our kids from the potential harms of social media features that encourage excessive use,&#34; Gov. Hochul said in a statement. The law will apply when any of these platforms are being accessed from New York. Gov. Hochul also signed two bills into law last year aimed at protecting kids from social media.
Concerns over the mental health effects of social media platforms on younger users have been mounting and government bodies have been increasingly taking action. A bill similar to the one in New York has been proposed in California. This year Australia became the first nation to ban social media for children, with Denmark soon to follow.
Last year the US surgeon general said social media should come with warning labels and highlighted data associating social media use with increased anxiety and depression in youth. The risks of social media use on children&#39;s mental health are multifactorial and are still being studied.

High severity flaw in MongoDB could allow memory leakage,"
		
					  
						




Document database vendor MongoDB has advised customers to update immediately following the discovery of a flaw that could allow unauthenticated users to read uninitialized heap memory.



Designated CVE-2025-14847, the bug, mismatched length fields in zlib compressed protocol headers, could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code and potentially seize control of a device.



The flaw affects the following MongoDB and MongoDB Server versions:




MongoDB 8.2.0 through 8.2.3



MongoDB 8.0.0 through 8.0.16



MongoDB 7.0.0 through 7.0.26



MongoDB 6.0.0 through 6.0.26



MongoDB 5.0.0 through 5.0.31



MongoDB 4.4.0 through 4.4.29



All MongoDB Server v4.2 versions



All MongoDB Server v4.0 versions



All MongoDB Server v3.6 versions




In its advisory, MongoDB “strongly suggested” that users upgrade immediately to the patched versions of the software: MongoDB 8.2.3, 8.0.17, 7.0.28, 6.0.27, 5.0.32, or 4.4.30.



However, it said, “if you cannot upgrade immediately, disable zlib compression on the MongoDB Server by starting mongod or mongos with a networkMessageCompressors or a net.compression.compressors option that explicitly omits zlib.”



MongoDB, one of the most popular NoSQL document databases for developers, says it currently has more than 62,000 customers worldwide, including 70% of the Fortune 100.

What we listened to in 2025,"If streaming services’ year-in-review campaigns have shown us anything, it’s that we’ve spent a staggering amount of time drowning out the hum of everyday life with music, podcasts and audio series. And with some incredible new releases this year, we were really eatin’ good. Here are some of the Engadget team’s favorite things we listened to in 2025.Spiritbox - Tsunami SeaI became aware of Spiritbox in late 2024 shortly before the band dropped its latest album, Tsunami Sea. At the time, I was in a deep Sleep Token phase, and I don’t remember how I stumbled upon Spiritbox, but I’m sure glad I did. Not knowing anything about the band, I initially thought it had two singers: one for clean vocals and another for the harsh, guttural screams. Well, I was wrong. Vocalist Courtney LaPlante handles it all, and she is a force of nature. After learning of a new band, I do what any self-respecting music nerd does: I looked up live videos of them on YouTube. The way LaPlante seamlessly transitions from airy, ambient singing to some of the best growls you’ll hear in metal music is effortless. And after seeing Spiritbox live in person earlier in December, I can attest to her ability to consistently nail both vocal styles for the entirety of an hour-long set. My infatuation with Spiritbox isn’t just with the vocalist though. Guitarist Mike Stringer, LaPlante’s husband, also has a lot of unique abilities to offer. Stringer’s use of noise and whammy effects in his riffs create a signature style, not to mention his mix of nu-metal, djent and metalcore sensibilities. He also has some of the thickest guitar tones I’ve ever heard live, and I was mesmerized for the full set. Stringer’s guitar work on Tsunami Sea is a prime example of a  unique musician at the height of his powers. Tsunami Sea takes you on a ride. The first two tracks are all-out ragers, and after a slight respite in “Perfect Soul” and “Keep Sweet,” the album’s best song comes fifth. I’ve heard LaPlante dedicate it to “all the people I love to fucking hate,” and it’s clearly written about her enemies. It’s also the perfect example of what this band is capable of. It’s three minutes of LaPlante’s screams interlaced with plenty of Stringer’s trademark guitar work. The rest of the album showcases the band’s ability to blend dynamics, with “No Loss, No Love” and “Ride The Wave” providing the highlights on the back half of the record. The album’s title track is a great vehicle for LaPlante’s clean vocals, serving as the introduction to the album’s second act. If you’ve been enamored with Sleep Token this year like I have, give Spiritbox a go — you won’t be sorry you did. — Billy Steele, Deputy Editor, ReviewsBandsplainI didn’t discover Bandsplain in 2025, but I definitely listened to it more than any other podcast in terms of total time spent. Sure, that’s because most episodes are over three hours long, but I digress. Host Yasi Salek does a deep dive on “cult bands and iconic artists” to… ahem, bandsplain why people love them. There’s a deep catalog of back episodes, so there’s sure to be an in-depth analysis of a band you’re familiar with. But even if you think you know an artist, I’m willing to bet Salek will divulge parts of the story you weren’t aware of. Jimmy Eat World’s Clarity is a top 5 all-timer for me, and Salek had plenty to offer about the narrative around that album I didn’t know. Her grunge series from 2024 was a history lesson I wish I’d had in middle school when I first discovered Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains and the rest of the lot. An older episode about Nine Inch Nails served as the primer for me seeing the band live for the first time in September. And that’s the thing about the show: the back catalog holds up. If you’re waiting for the next installment to drop, there’s certainly something in the archives you’ll enjoy. No shade to Salek’s colleagues at The Ringer, but the best episodes of Bandsplain are when the guest is a musician. Thursday front man Geoff Rickly was excellent on that Nine Inch Nails episode, and Death Cab for Cutie singer Ben Gibbard had me on the edge of my seat when he was on to discuss The La’s — a band I’d never heard of before. I’d also highly recommend the episodes on Oasis and the more recent one on Alanis Morissette. But, really, you can’t go wrong starting from anywhere on the episode list. — B.S.Lucy Dacus - Forever is a Feeling I remember being a teenager and hearing from an adult that they did not religiously seek out, research, evaluate and introduce new bands and songs into their lives as if all existence would cease without the life-sustaining energy of new music. I was confused, concerned and damn sure that wouldn’t happen to me. You know where this story goes: Job. Kid. House. Spouse. Pets that will die if I don’t feed, walk, play with and/or medicate them. I allow the algorithm to feed me new songs but rarely does something stick, so I end up listening to tracks I bonded with in my teens and twenties. This year, Blossom &amp; Bones, a three-day music festival in Ghost Ranch, New Mexico, managed to push through the churn and lodge new music into my brain. Along with my kid and some friends, I camped among some of the most beautiful landscapes imaginable and ambled over to the stage each evening for performances by Santigold, Ani DiFranco and about a dozen more. Lucy Dacus, one third of the indie group Boygenius, did a one-hour set with plenty of songs from her latest album Forever is a Feeling. Hearing the songs for the first time, I felt like I’d been listening to them for years. Lilting harmonies and layered strings create a lovely backdrop for Dacus’s velvet voice, but there’s a sharpness to her observations about relationships, rejection and sex. I’ve been looping the album ever since. — Amy Skorheim, Senior Reporter, Buying AdviceBlanco White - “So Certain” (single)Early on the last concert of the day at that same festival, Blanco White took the stage. People were aimlessly milling about and the sun hadn’t yet set. Kids were playing on the lawn and the smell from the food trucks was intense, but I was enrapt by the four people on stage. The sad violin and strummy guitars floated with the hand-beat drum out into the red hills. The music sounded like I felt: rooted and wrapped in the harsh beauty of the desert and I was really glad to take that home with me. — A.S.Martian Revolution If you&#39;re as big a nerd as I am, you might know that Leo Tolstoy didn&#39;t consider War and Peace to be a novel. The story is what most people read for, but in the author&#39;s mind, all the drama was a parable to illustrate his grand theory of history.Over the last year, history podcaster Mike Duncan has accomplished a similar feat using a medium Tolstoy never imagined. Duncan&#39;s Revolutions podcast has covered ten different revolutionary upheavals across history, starting with the English Civil War and ending with the Russian Revolution. After wrapping up the Bolsheviks, Duncan took a few episodes to suggest a grand theory of how revolutions unfold. For a while, it seemed like that was all we&#39;d get. Then, in the middle of 2024, he started posting original sci-fi — without any indication that this tale, which followed future Martians revolting against their corporate overlords on Earth, was in any way different from the previous ten seasons.Part of what makes the Martian Revolution so excellent is Duncan&#39;s deadpan delivery. He never once breaks character. He rattles off lists of fictional sources, apologizes for inaccuracies in prior episodes, and introduces made-up historical figures with the same gravity he once used to mention George Washington or Simon Bolivar. If you&#39;re a fan of Revolutions, you&#39;ll have a blast recognizing character archetypes. (Mabel Dore is the Liberal Noble! Timothy Werner is the Man of Blood!)But the podcast is great even if you&#39;ve never listened to an episode of Revolutions. It has an excellent grasp of character and a sense of inevitable tragedy, but with moments of joy leavened throughout. I certainly hope we don&#39;t wind up in the megacorp-ruled future of the podcast, but if we do, it&#39;ll be a great consolation if it eventually turns out the way Duncan imagines. — Sam Chapman, Senior WriterRon Gallo - Checkmate My favorite artists are ones that surprise me, and Ron Gallo is a master of reinvention. He&#39;s dabbled in absurdist punk, psychedelia, garage rock, Beatles-tinged pop and, now, stripped-down acoustic music. This is not a genre I am typically a fan of, Elliott Smith withstanding, but Checkmate is something special. His lyrical prowess is off the charts here, trading his usual wordplay for simple and emotionally-gutting truisms about life, love and, well, the end of the world. Of course, the lyrics wouldn&#39;t work if the songs weren&#39;t good. The songs are very good. The title track is just about the perfect love song, with a primary hook that gets lost in your head for weeks. Other tracks offer hints of Mac DeMarco, Dan Fogelberg, Kevin Morby and just about everyone else who has crafted great songs on an acoustic guitar. It&#39;s fitting that Gallo has found a home on the label Kill Rock Stars, which released so much of Elliott Smith&#39;s work back in the day. As an aside, Gallo regularly posts songs about current events on TikTok and other social media platforms, which are worth checking out if you like stuff like Jesse Welles. — Lawrence Bonk, Contributing ReporterDe La Soul - Cabin in the SkyThere have been hip-hop albums that explored the finality and tragedy of death, but not many that truly tackled spirituality and long-term grief. De La Soul has done just that, following the passing of founding member Trugoy the Dove. This album serves as a final testament of sorts for Trugoy, as he&#39;s heavily featured throughout. In that way, Cabin in the Sky is reminiscent of A Tribe Called Quest&#39;s 2016 masterpiece We Got It from Here... Thank You 4 Your Service, which followed the death of rapper Phife Dawg. Like Tribe&#39;s modern classic, Cabin in the Sky is filled with absolute bangers. It features standout beats by DJ Premier, Pete Rock, Trugoy, Jake One and others. The rhymes are great and all three primary De La members are given time to shine. Guest rappers like Common and Nas got the memo, delivering some of their most memorable verses in years. Heck, even Giancarlo Esposito is on board as the narrator. Some reviewers have dinged this album for being too long but, come on, that&#39;s like complaining there&#39;s too much pizza. It&#39;s De La Soul. — L.B.FKA twigs - EusexuaThis was a really good year for new music IMO, so much that I&#39;ve been finding it pretty difficult to think back and settle on my favorite releases. But, FKA twigs&#39; Eusexua undeniably did some heavy lifting for me, pretty much carrying me through the first six or so months of the year without much competition, and I&#39;ve circled right back to it as the year closes. It&#39;s an album that somehow seems to meet every vibe. It&#39;ll have you in club mode and ready for a night of sweaty, filthy dancing in under three minutes, or feeling bright and upbeat like a midday walk on the first day of spring — yet it still hits when you&#39;re having a good ol&#39; car cry. &#34;Girl Feels Good&#34; is for sure one of my most-played songs of the year, followed closely by &#34;Eusexua,&#34; &#34;Perfect Stranger,&#34; &#34;Keep It, Hold It&#34; and &#34;Striptease.&#34; If ever I can&#39;t decide what I&#39;m in the mood to listen to, I throw this album on and it doesn&#39;t disappoint. — Cheyenne MacDonald, Weekend EditorFaetooth - Labyrinthine Faetooth&#39;s sophomore album, Labyrinthine, is face-melting, melancholic perfection. The band describes its sound as &#34;fairy doom,&#34; but don&#39;t let that first word fool you into thinking it isn&#39;t heavy as hell. Labyrinthine goes unbelievably hard, and will have you feeling like you&#39;re eternally wandering a cursed bog, surrounded by the wailing of the unfortunate souls who came before you. Don&#39;t believe me? Put on &#34;White Noise.&#34; This is really an album that should be enjoyed in its entirety, though, and I can&#39;t individually name half the songs on it because I tend to just keep the whole thing playing on rotation. — C.M. Orville Peck - Appaloosa This EP is truly a testament to my ability to run my obsessions into the ground, because it only came out in mid-November and somehow landed on my most-listened wrapup for the end of the year… which was released some two weeks later. It&#39;s front-loaded with its strongest songs, a powerful and kind of haunting trio that just flows beautifully from one into the other: &#34;Dreaded Sundown,&#34; to &#34;Drift Away&#34; into &#34;Atchafalaya&#34; (ft. Noah Cyrus). As a fan of musicals, I also loved the inclusion of &#34;Maybe This Time,&#34; a cover from Cabaret, especially since I was pretty bummed to have missed Peck&#39;s stint as the Emcee in Cabaret on Broadway this summer. — C.M.Case 63 I got into an audio series kick this year, and dove into shows like Unicorn Girl, Stalked! and more. But none of the dramatized fiction I listened to in 2025 had me hooked like Case 63. Setting aside that it’s voice-acted by A-listers Julianne Moore and Oscar Isaac, which is a phenomenal pairing that won me over on star power alone. The best thing about Case 63 is its storytelling. Moore stars as a psychologist, meeting Isaac for the first time in a prison interview. Isaac has been claiming to be a traveler of sorts, and through recorded sessions and voice notes, we hear his side of the story, as well as her reactions and ultimate involvement in the adventures. Every step of the way, particularly in the beginning, there is clear explanation as to why the exchange is being recorded. It isn’t necessary, but it’s helpful in my buying into the realism of the story. It isn’t just the method and technical aspects of the storytelling, of course. Narratively, Case 63 is a gripping ride, and thanks to its short episodes, it’s easy to binge really quickly. There is certainly a generous use of cliffhangers to help speed things along, but I found myself eager to devour the entire series in one commute. The story continued to linger in my mind days after I finished both existing seasons, and I’m hoping the new one drops soon. If you’re looking for a quick and easy sci-fi audio series, do not miss Case 63. — Cherlynn Low, Managing EditorSecure Love I spent a lot of time this year trying to learn more about my attachment style and how it shows up in all the relationships in my life. Between Stephanie Rigg’s On Attachment podcast, the TV show Couples Therapy and all the books on the topic of attachment styles, trauma and more, I’ve consumed them all. And while they’ve all been helpful in different ways, one podcast stuck out to me this year. It’s hosted by Julie Menanno, MA, LMFT, LCPC, creator of the @TheSecureRelationship account on Instagram and the author of Secure Love: Create a relationship that lasts a lifetime. You can probably tell from that introduction what Menanno’s work is all about. Relationships, from the lens of attachment styles. The Secure Love Podcast doesn’t just re-deliver the same information we’ve seen published across various media and platforms, though. Each season of the podcast (it’s partway through the second as of this writing) sees Menanno work with one couple through their negative cycles, using somatic practices to help each partner understand their emotions, triggers and reactions. Because we’re listening to real people talk about real-life happenings, it’s not only easy to relate, but listeners often see themselves in these scenarios. At the start of each episode, too, Menanno reads out or plays notes from the audience, and you can see how fellow listeners have reacted. This season, for example, my friend and some other listeners seemed to really dislike Brian, the anxious male partner in this season’s pair. While I’ve certainly found some of Brian’s ways of speaking borderline offensive, I had a lot more sympathy for him as I started seeing his traits in my loved ones. I also started to identify with his partner Bethany, who Menanno typed as having an avoidant attachment style. As I listened to Bethany and Brian describe the reasons they got into fights and explain where they were coming from, suddenly it felt like the world made sense. I saw similar patterns and reasonings in my own relationship, as well as those of my parents, relatives and friends. It is slightly voyeuristic to listen to something so intimate, of course, but Menanno makes it all educational rather than just entertaining. She gently interrupts parts of each episode to tell the audience why she asks certain questions or what she’s attempting to achieve by asking Brian or Bethany to sit with their difficult feelings. I found her method familiar, as I recently started working with a somatic coach whose approach is similar to Menanno’s, which is rooted in emotion-focused therapy (EFT). Staying with uncomfortable feelings makes me want to jump out of my skin, but being able to endure them, question why they arise and then understand where they come from is crucial to helping uncover the thinking that causes them. Sometimes they’re the result of flawed logic, catastrophic thinking or a simple lack of context, but often they’re very reasonable reactions. If you’re looking to understand yourself and your emotions a bit better, or just want to get an idea of what EFT or couples therapy sounds like, I can’t recommend The Secure Love Podcast highly enough. — C.L.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/what-we-listened-to-in-2025-201308584.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2Fphoto-collage.png_%252812%2529_7356.png&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=a8f71d04547f9835abef458de86c2f7c2bef77a5,https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/what-we-listened-to-in-2025-201308584.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-26T20:13:08Z,8,Tech

The best iPad accessories for 2026,"The best iPad accessories can make an aging tablet feel like new again, or give you additional ways to use that new slab you just bought. Whether it&#39;s a slim folio case, an Apple Pencil, a docking station or a paper-like screen protector, there are so many iPad accessories out there that can transform how you use your tablet on a regular basis — and make your iPad last longer, too. We&#39;ve tested a plethora of accessories over the years, and these are the best iPad accessories you can get right now.

Which iPad generation do you own? 
Before you splurge on a bunch of accessories, you should double check which iPad generation you own. There are a couple of ways to do this: first, you can check the back of your tablet for its model number, which will start with an “A” and end with a series of numbers. You can also go into Settings on your iPad, then General and look up the model number in the top section. If you see a series of letters and numbers with a slash (“/“) in it, just tap that to reveal the iPad’s true model number. 
The most important iPad details to consider before buying accessories are the charging port, screen size and Apple Pencil compatibility. Most iPads now have USB-C charging, save for the now discontinued 9th-gen iPad that still requires a Lightning cable. Make sure to double check your iPad’s screen size before buying a folio for iPad or a screen protector — especially if you have the new iPad Air 11-inch. As for the Apple Pencil, check out this guide to how to choose the right Apple Pencil (and even replacement pencil tips) to make sure you&#39;re getting the right one for the tablet you have.

iPad screen protectors 
If you’re a heavy user of the Apple Pencil or some other stylus, you should consider getting a screen protector for your new iPad. They pull double-duty: Not only do they act as a first line of defense if your iPad goes careening onto concrete, but they can also enhance the digital drawing and writing experience. Using a stylus on an iPad is strange at first because gliding the stylus nib over a glass surface feels nothing like “normal” writing. Matte screen protectors can get closer to replicating the pen-on-paper experience, and they also prevent the stylus nib from wearing down as quickly.

LG announces line of premium gaming monitors that offer 5K visuals,"LG has revealed a new lineup of gaming monitors just ahead of CES. The UltraGear evo displays offer 5K visuals. Many incorporate on-device AI upscaling, taking some of the burden away from the GPU. 
LG says the tech will let consumers skip out on some card upgrades. This could end up being extremely beneficial because the AI boom has been impacting GPU prices.
LG
There are three displays in the lineup so far, with more to come down the line. There&#39;s a 39-inch OLED (39GX950B) that includes the aforementioned AI upscaling to 5K, but also algorithms for scene optimization and sound. The company says this will &#34;refine images and audio performance for a more immersive audiovisual experience.&#34;
This monitor can easily switch from the standard resolution with a refresh rate of 165Hz to a much zippier WFHD resolution with a refresh rate of 330Hz. This is supported by a 0.03ms response time. It&#39;s curved with a 21:9 aspect ratio.
LG
There&#39;s also a 27-inch MiniLED (27GM950B) in the lineup. This display has been &#34;designed to dramatically improve blooming control&#34;, which is done by minimizing halo effects and stuffing in 2,304 local dimming zones. LG promises it &#34;preserves fine details across bright and dark scenes alike.&#34;
This one features AI algorithms for upscaling to 5K, scene optimization and sound. It can also switch between 165Hz at 5K and 330Hz at QHD, with a 1ms response time. The screen boasts a peak brightness of 1,250 nits.
LG
Finally, there&#39;s the beastly 52-inch (52G930B) large-format gaming display. You didn&#39;t read that wrong. This is a 52-inch gaming monitor. This 5K display offers a speedy 240Hz refresh rate. The 1000R curvature wraps around the peripheral, which should be great for flying sims and stuff like that.
LG hasn&#39;t released any information as to when we&#39;ll be able to get our mitts on these displays, or how much they will cost. With all the tech on offer, it&#39;s likely they&#39;ll cost a pretty penny.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/lg-announces-line-of-premium-gaming-monitors-that-offer-5k-visuals-165224945.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F95f32c20-e278-11f0-bddd-141aca74464e&resize=1400%2C778&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=f49a53dd6c673b929b3d38dcef816040e0a41e9f,https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/lg-announces-line-of-premium-gaming-monitors-that-offer-5k-visuals-165224945.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-26T16:52:24Z,7,Tech

Our favorite books we read in 2025,"This was the kind of year that felt 100 years long, so who could blame us for leaning into a bit of escapism? Some of us buried our noses in books in 2025, and thankfully, there were plenty of good reads to get lost in. Here are some of the Engadget team’s top picks from the year.Wild Dark Shore by Charlotte McConaghyWild Dark Shore pulls off a magnificent balancing act of telling an intimate, personal story coupled with the backdrop of impending climate disaster. A father and two children are living on a remote island near Antarctica, taking care of a vast seed bank that was part of an abandoned research facility. They’re literally trying to stay above water for a few months until they get bailed out from the island along with as much of the seed bank as they can save before it goes under when a woman named Rowan washes up on shore. She survives, is nursed back to health, and starts forming bonds with her rescuers and their mission — but at the same time, she has some unexpected connections to the island and the former research team that lived there that she keeps to herself.The magic of this book is in the way Charlotte McConaghy builds tensions from many sources throughout the book; you feel a lingering sense of discomfort through, waiting for the other shoe to fall even as Rowan gets closer and closer to the family. It’s a small-scale story at its heart, but with the backdrop of disaster looming the stakes feel extremely high. And McConaghy is a master at putting these feelings on the page in gorgeous prose. As she showed in her previous work Migrations, she has a real talent for realistically describing near-future climate disasters, but Wild Dark Shore raises the personal stakes in a visceral way. — Nathan Ingraham, Deputy EditorMoonflow by Bitter Karella This book is a chaotic and deeply weird rollercoaster ride that repeatedly gave me whiplash, and I loved it. Fair warning, it&#39;s not for the weak-stomached. It is horrifying, hilarious, nauseating and somehow a very good time and a very bad time simultaneously. Moonflow is told through dual narratives, one following Sarah, a trans woman and mushroom dealer who has found herself in a desperate situation, and the other following the henchwomen of a deranged cult that&#39;s made its home in a cursed forest. After Sarah ventures into these woods in search of the King&#39;s Breakfast, a rare mushroom said to grant divine understanding to those who consume it, all hell breaks loose.Karella&#39;s writing is immersive, and this is the kind of book you can see, feel, hear and smell, for better and worse. Every person in this book is like a caricature of someone I&#39;ve crossed paths with at some point in life, and the names of the cult members are just… chef&#39;s kiss. Some of them had me howling. It is completely unpredictable — except in those few moments where it seems the author wants you to know exactly where things are going just to make you dread the inevitable. Reading Moonflow was a visceral, unforgettable experience. — Cheyenne MacDonald, Weekend EditorSimplicity by Mattie LubchanskyAnother one about a cult, except this cult rules. I picked up Simplicity knowing nothing about it except that everyone cool on the internet seemed to be praising it, and was excited to discover that it&#39;s set near where I live in New York&#39;s Hudson Valley, in a future version of the Catskills. And here in the Hudson Valley, it often feels like I&#39;m one or two innocuous decisions away from accidentally joining a cult, so there was an immediate connection. In Simplicity, it&#39;s the year 2081 and New York City is a high-tech dystopia run by a billionaire. North of the city, though, various communities have settled off-grid, including a group called The Spiritual Association of Peers.Lucius Pasternak, a trans man, is sent on an anthropological assignment from the mayor to SAP&#39;s compound, Simplicity, and it doesn&#39;t take long for their uninhibited way of life to start growing on him. But Lucius soon begins to have strange dreams, and a series of violent attacks shakes up the community. Through his mission to understand the people of SAP and later to find and stop the entity that&#39;s targeting them, a beautiful story about queerness and identity and belonging and fighting for what&#39;s important unfolds. This feels like the kind of book that should be passed around between friends who just get it, and I imagine many readers will feel incredibly seen by it like I did. — C.M. The Buffalo Hunter Hunter by Stephen Graham JonesOr Stephen Graham Jones&#39; Interview with the Vampire. The Buffalo Hunter Hunter blends historical fiction and horror to give us one of the most impactful vampire novels of our time — one that serves as an uncomfortable but necessary reminder of the atrocities committed against indigenous people in the US by white settlers. It begins with the discovery of a crumbling journal that claims to contain the confession of a Blackfeet man-turned-vampire named Good Stab, as told to Lutheran pastor Arthur Beaucarne. What follows is a gutting chronicle of slaughter, heartbreak and revenge. It&#39;s a classic in the making. — C.M.Isola by Allegra GoodmanHistorical fiction is how I trick my brain into possibly learning something. And because the endings are set, the author has to hook you into the drama with more than just the peril of an unknown outcome. I fell deep into Wolf Hall even though I knew which heads Henry VIII chopped off. I thought Isola might be similarly gratifying.  It tells the story of Marguerite de la Rocque de Roberval, a young noblewoman from France who was intentionally marooned on an island off the coast of Canada in 1542. The story is based on historical records so you know the plot won’t adhere to safe formulas, but mon dieu, I was not prepared for how rough things would be for Marguerite. Her troubles began long before she found herself fighting for survival on a wild uninhabited island with brutal winters. From birth, nearly every happiness was undercut by more dominant forces, yet the woman never stopped moving forward. Thankfully, Goodman draws Marguerite’s character not as some tired brand of plucky heroine with grit and a wink, but as a perceptive, pragmatic being who also gives in to impulse and doesn’t have everything figured out. Isola is beautifully rendered, from the stone chateaus to creaking ships and rough abundance of the island. Despite being set over 400 years ago, nothing feels dated. Human versus universe is an unfair battle, but I rooted for Marguerite on every page — and those pages turned quickly. — Amy Skorheim, Senior Reporter, Buying AdviceOld Soul by Susan BarkerThis was one of the first books I read this year, and it&#39;s really stuck with me. Old Soul travels through time and all over the world, across multiple storylines to trace the devastating impact of one mysterious woman who seems to defy the rules of mortality and always leave tragedy in her wake. Barker&#39;s writing in Old Soul pulls the reader in and doesn&#39;t let go. It&#39;s an unsettling slow burn that did a great job of getting under my skin.  — C.M.Meet Me at the Crossroads by Megan GiddingsIf a door appeared out of nowhere, would you go through it not knowing what lies beyond or if you&#39;d be able to return? In Meet Me at the Crossroads, seven doors pop up one day around the world, and people are unsurprisingly captivated by them. Regular people tempt fate, the ultra-wealthy plan exclusive excursions through them, religions form around their mystique. Ayanna is a teenager who was brought up in one of these religions. She&#39;s also a twin, with a sister named Olivia who she&#39;s been separated from after their parents&#39; split. When it comes time for Ayanna to go through one of the doors as part of a ceremony, Olivia makes a last-second decision to go with her. What follows is the aftermath of that decision. Meet Me at the Crossroads is a haunting and emotional journey.  — C.M.Woodworking by Emily St. JamesI am cisgender, white middle-aged man, so the experience of learning and accepting a different gender identity is something I will never fully understand. But Woodworking, the debut novel by Emily St. James, is a hilarious, tragic and ultimatley hopeful look at two trans women navigating different moments of acceptance in their lives. Erica is a mid-30s high school teacher who is recently divorced and just figuring out that she’s trans, something no one else knows about her at the start. Her student, 17-year-old Abigail, is her opposite: proudly out about her identity in a way that’s uncommon and dangerous in her small, conversative town in South Dakota. Their paths intersect, and Abigail ends up in the uncomfortable and somewhat unethical role of helping Erica find herself. After all she’s confident and not afraid of who she is — but she’s also still a teenager, one dealing with massive trauma of her own. The dual look into these two protagonists, each with sections of the book narrated from their own points of view, gave me a vivid picture of the different challlenges, emotions and dangers trans people face. But the unexpected community that develops around both characters plainly shows the value of living as your true self in a way that (hopefully) anyone should be able to relate to. — N.I.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/our-favorite-books-we-read-in-2025-160000704.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2Fphoto-collage.png_%252811%2529.png&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=02636e1e712461ea17b209a9906a1c5c34af0e80,https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/our-favorite-books-we-read-in-2025-160000704.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-26T16:00:00Z,7,Tech

LG will show off a humanoid robot for household chores at CES 2026,"LG will present a home robot named CLOiD at CES 2026 in Las Vegas. With humanoid robotics sure to feature heavily at this year&#39;s tech conference, LG has teased its home assistant before a full unveiling in January.
The company says CLOiD&#39;s two articulated arms with five individually actuated fingers are designed to help with a variety of household tasks. However, LG has not yet given a specific example of a task CLOiD can handle. We&#39;re also not sure what it looks like, because aside from a couple of very close-up images of CLOiD&#39;s hands, LG is keeping what the robot looks like under wraps until the show. 
LG said CLOiD is part of the company&#39;s vision that “Zero Labor Home, Makes Quality Time.” It said its robot is a step toward a company goal of &#34;freeing customers from the time-consuming demands of housework.&#34; 
CLOiD&#39;s chipset is housed in its head, which also sports a display, speaker, camera and a bevy of sensors meant to enable expressive communication. LG says its new robot is powered by its &#34;Affectionate Intelligence&#34; technology and is designed to interact in a neutral, user-friendly way. It&#39;s also designed to refine its responses through repeated interactions with a user.
CES often plays host to proof-of-concept products that offer a window into the future but may not make it to market. It remains to be seen if CLOiD is simply a booth-side attention-getter or something with real potential. Visitors can see CLOiD handle some real-life scenarios at LG&#39;s booth in the Las Vegas Convention Center.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/lg-will-show-off-a-humanoid-robot-for-household-chores-at-ces-2026-145411218.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2Fde28fe30-e268-11f0-b863-143f6e823715&resize=1400%2C910&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=617864b90ca94961ca7906072b841d8374b219c6,https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/lg-will-show-off-a-humanoid-robot-for-household-chores-at-ces-2026-145411218.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-26T14:54:11Z,10,Tech

Apple will allow third-party app stores and payment processing in Brazil,"Brazilian regulators have reached a settlement with Apple after a yearslong investigation into the company&#39;s App Store fee practices as well as its policies against third-party app stores. As first reported by Brazilian tech site tecnoblog, the nation&#39;s Administrative Council of Economic Defense (CADE) said it has accepted Apple&#39;s proposed agreement that will address claims of anticompetitive practices.
The agreement will allow for third-party payment processing methods for in-app purchases and reins in Apple&#39;s anti-steering efforts by allowing links to external websites for transactions. The settlement requires that these payment options be shown next to Apple&#39;s own. Apple must also allow third-party app stores to be installed on its devices, though the company is allowed to display warnings to users if they are written in a neutral and objective way.
A new fee structure has also been agreed to, with Apple applying no fee if users are directed to outside payment methods in a text-only way. The use of a clickable link or button for an external payment option will incur a 15 percent fee. Purchases made within Apple&#39;s App Store will still be subject to a 10 percent or 20 percent commission. Developers using Apple’s payment system would also be subject to a 5 percent transaction fee.
Additionally a 5 percent &#34;Core Technology Fee&#34; would be levied against all app downloads from third-party app stores. This new structure bears similarities to policy and fee changes made after the EU passed its Digital Markets Act, with Apple allowing third-party app stores and external purchases subject to varying fees.
Apple will have 105 days to comply under the new agreement and could face fines of up to $27 million for failure to implement the changes. The iPhone maker has been facing mounting pressure from regulators worldwide over its anti-steering practices and was recently handed a $587 million fine by the EU for violating its Digital Markets Act. Apple is appealing the fine. In the US, Apple has been embroiled in a court battle with Fortnite maker Epic Games over commissions on purchases that take place on third-party payment platforms.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-will-allow-third-party-app-stores-and-payment-processing-in-brazil-135114824.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F886c2140-dc44-11f0-af5f-72baa770d1dc&resize=1400%2C914&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=a6b161d59455ff01133e8eb753351e8f69f5fb96,https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-will-allow-third-party-app-stores-and-payment-processing-in-brazil-135114824.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-26T13:51:15Z,7,Tech

How to find lost AirPods,"Losing AirPods happens to the best of us. They’re small, they slide into couch cushions and they love disappearing into bags or pockets when you least expect it. Luckily, Apple’s Find My system makes it easy to track down misplaced AirPods, whether you dropped the case somewhere or can’t find one of the individual earbuds. With the right settings enabled, your iPhone can show the last place they were connected, play a sound to help you hunt them down or even guide you with on-screen directions. Here’s how to use Find My to locate lost AirPods and how to track down the left or right earbud if only one has gone missing.How to use Find My to locate AirPodsIf your AirPods are paired with an Apple device linked to your Apple ID, they automatically appear in the Find My app. You don’t need to enable this manually, but you do need Bluetooth turned on during regular use so the system can refresh their location.Open the Find My app on your iPhone, iPad or Mac and go to the Devices tab. Your AirPods should appear in the list. If they’re online or recently connected to your device, Find My will show their current location on a map. If they’re offline, the app will show the last place they were detected, which can help narrow down where to start searching.For many people, this alone is enough to jog a memory. Find My might show your gym, a friend’s house or the bus stop where they slipped out of your pocket. If the location seems familiar, head there first and refresh the app once you arrive so it can update if the AirPods reconnect.If Find My says your AirPods are nearby but you still can’t see them, you can make them play a locating sound. Tap Play Sound in the device menu and the earbuds will emit a rising chirp that gets louder over a few seconds. This is especially helpful for finding AirPods hiding under blankets, inside bags or behind furniture.Keep in mind that AirPods need enough battery to make noise, and the charging case itself cannot play sound unless you have AirPods 4 (ANC), AirPods Pro 2, or AirPods Pro 3 that support that feature. If nothing plays, try refreshing the app or checking the last location again.AirPods models, like the AirPods Pro (2nd gen) and AirPods Pro (3rd gen) with MagSafe charging cases support Precision Finding. This feature uses the U1 chip inside your iPhone to show a directional arrow, distance estimate and haptic feedback as you get closer. Not all models have this feature, but if yours do, the Find My app will display a Find Nearby button.Follow the on-screen prompts and slowly rotate your phone. The iPhone will show when you’re walking in the right direction and tell you when you’re close enough to start looking under cushions or inside drawers.How to locate individual AirPodsAirPods have a habit of separating from each other, and losing only the left or right earbud may happen as frequently as misplacing the entire case. One of the most useful features in Find My is the ability to track each earbud individually. Here’s how to do it:Locate your AirPods in the Find My app and select the option to locate the Left or Right earbud.Select the earbud that’s missing. The map will update to show its location. If the missing bud has nearby location support, you can use Find Nearby to get directional guidance. If not, you can still use Play Sound, as long as it has enough battery.If Find My shows your lost earbud as Offline, you’ll still see its last known location. This can be enough to help you retrace your steps. Once you get within Bluetooth range again, the status may change to Online and let you use Play Sound.If you think the earbud is still somewhere in your home, try refreshing Find My while walking slowly from room to room. The device may reconnect once you get close enough.How to find a missing AirPods caseFinding the AirPods case is a little trickier because only newer models have support for sound playback or Precision Finding. If your case supports Find My, you’ll see options similar to locating the earbuds themselves. If it doesn’t, the app will only show the last place the case was connected.If your earbuds are in the case but the case is not supported by Find My, you may not be able to play sound until you open it or pull one of the earbuds out.Find My is a powerful tool for tracking down misplaced AirPods, and knowing how to use all of its features makes the search much easier. Whether you’re trying to find the entire set, one stray earbud or a case that wandered off, the app can lead you back to them with sound alerts, location markers and even directional guidance on supported models. With a few minutes of searching, you’ll usually have your AirPods back in your ears and your music playing again.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/how-to-find-lost-airpods-120000144.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2Fcf0245d0-73cc-11ef-bf59-6a0c4050409d.jpeg&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=c91fa864eb48fd9afb706aad8c17c437e04f40d9,https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/how-to-find-lost-airpods-120000144.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-26T12:00:00Z,9,Tech

The best SSDs for PS5 in 2026,"Storage fills up fast on a PS5, especially when a single game can take up as much space as an entire last-gen library. Adding moreSSD space is the easiest way to stop playing Tetris with your installs, and once it is set up, your console loads games just as quickly as it does from the built-in drive. It is a small upgrade that makes a big difference if you jump between several titles at once.The tricky part is knowing which SSDs actually work with the PS5. You need a drive that meets Sony’s speed requirements and stays cool under long play sessions. Some models include a heatsink, while others let you use your own to save a little money. We tested the top options and picked the best SSDs for PS5 to help you upgrade without hassle.Read more: These are the best SSDs in 2026

How we test PS5 SSDs 
I’ve tested most of the SSDs recommended on this list, either for PS5 or computer use. I also bought and used our top pick in my own PS5. 
PS5 SSD FAQs 
How much PS5 storage do I need? 
The PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro can accept internal drives with between 250GB and 8TB of storage capacity. If you already own a PS5, chances are you have a reasonable idea of how much storage you need ​​for your game library. If you’re buying an SSD with a new PS5 or PS5 Pro, or buying for someone else, it’s more difficult to tell what you might need for a high-performance experience. 
PS5 games are smaller on average than their PS4 equivalents, typically taking up between 30GB and 100GB, with some notable (and very popular) exceptions. If you’re a fan of the Call of Duty series, installing Black Ops 6 and Warzone 2.0 can eat up to 240GB. In other words, a full Call of Duty install will take up more than one-third of the PS5’s internal storage. If you’re not a CoD fan, though, chances are you’ll be good to store between six to 10 games on a regular PS5 internally before running into problems. 
You also need to consider your internet speed. If you live in an area with slow broadband, the “you can just download it again” rationale doesn’t really work. At my old home, a 100GB download took me around eight hours, during which time it was difficult to simultaneously watch Twitch or, say, publish articles about upgrading PS5 SSDs. Keeping games around on the off-chance you’ll want to play them at some point makes sense.

Off the bat, there&#39;s basically no point in going for a 250GB PS5 SSD. Economically, 250GB drives aren’t that much cheaper than 500GB ones — and practically, that really isn’t a lot of space for modern games to live on. 500GB drives can be a decent option, but after years of declining prices, I think the sweet spot for most people is to opt for a high-capacity 1TB or 2TB drive, which should run you at most $200. The latter will more than double the PS5 Pro’s storage without breaking the bank. 
Unless you’re rolling in cash and want to flex, 4TB and 8TB models should mostly be avoided, as you’ll end up paying more per gigabyte than you would with a 1TB or 2TB drive. 
While the 825GB PS5 only provides 667GB of storage, that’s largely due to storage being reserved for the operating system and caching. If you install a 1TB PS5 SSD, you&#39;ll have, within a margin of error, 1TB of storage available for games. Out of the box, the PS5 Pro offers 1.86TB of storage for games, though you can eke out more if you delete the pre-installed Astro’s Playroom (gasp). 
Since neither the PS5 Slim nor PS5 Pro feature updated CPU architecture, all of our recommendations will work with whatever PS5 model you own. 
Can you play PS5 games on an external SSD? 
External hard drives tend to cost less than internal SSD counterparts (and there’s a good chance you might own one already). Unfortunately, there are restrictions on what you can do with them. An external SSD connects to your PS5 via USB, and is only suitable for playing PlayStation 4 games, or storing PS5 titles. That’s useful if you have anything but the best high-speed internet — it’s faster to move a PS5 game out of “cold storage” on an external drive than it is to re-download it — or want to keep your PS4 library on hand. 
Due to the limitations here, you don’t need the highest-performing model, although you should opt for SSDs over HDDs for improved transfer speeds and load times. Any basic portable drive from a reputable brand will do, with the Crucial X9 Pro and Samsung T7 being options we’ve tried and can recommend. 
Which SSD cards are compatible with the PS5? 
The official answer to this question is an “M.2 Socket 3 (Key M) Gen4 x4 NVME SSD.” But even within that seemingly specific description, there are additional factors to consider. The main requirements Sony has laid out for compatibility come down to speed, cooling and physical dimensions. 
For speed, Sony says drives should be able to handle sequential reads at 5,500MB/s. Early testing showed that the PS5 would accept drives as slow as 4,800MB/s, and that games that tap into the SSD regularly — such as Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart — would cause no issues. Pretty much the only thing the PS5 will outright reject is one that doesn&#39;t match the Gen4 x4 spec. 
In our opinion, though, using a drive slower than the specification is a risk that, if you don’t already have that drive lying around, is not worth taking. Just because we haven’t found issues yet doesn’t mean there won’t be games that could be problematic in the future. The price difference between these marginally slower Gen4 drives and the ones that meet Sony’s spec isn’t huge, and you might as well cover all your bases. 
Slightly more complicated than speed is cooling and size. Most new SSDs are going to be just fine; the PS5 can fit 22mm-wide SSDs of virtually any length (30mm, 40mm, 60mm, 80mm or 110mm, to be precise). The vast majority of drives you find will be 22mm wide and 80mm long, so no problem there. 
It should be noted that the system can fit a 25mm-wide drive, but that width must include the cooling solution. Speaking of, Sony says SSDs require “effective heat dissipation with a cooling structure, such as a heatsink.” The maximum height supported by Sony’s slot is 11.25mm, of which only 2.45mm can be “below” the drive. 
This previously meant some of the most popular heatsinked Gen4 SSDs, including Corsair’s MP600 Pro LP, would not fit within the PS5’s storage expansion slot. Since Engadget first published this guide in 2021, most NVMe makers, including Samsung, have come out with PlayStation-specific models that meet those requirements. That said, if you want to save some money, bare drives are often cheaper and it’s trivial to find a cooling solution that will work for the PS5. 
The only component in an NVMe SSD that really requires cooling is the controller, which without a heatsink will happily sear a (very small) steak. Most SSDs have chips on only one side, but even on double-sided SSDs, the controller is likely to be on top, as manufacturers know it needs to be positioned there to better dissipate heat. 
So, head to your PC component seller of choice and pick up basically anything that meets the recommended dimensions. A good search term is “laptop NVME heatsink,” as these will be designed to fit in the confines of gaming laptops, which are even more restrictive than a PS5. They’re also typically cheaper than the ones labeled as “PS5 heatsinks.” 
One recommendation is this $6 copper heatsink, which attaches to the PS5 SSD with sticky thermal interface material. It works just fine, and in performing stress tests on a PC, we couldn’t find anything metal that didn’t keep temperatures under control. When you’re searching, just make sure the solution you go for measures no more than 25mm wide or 8mm tall (including the thermal interface material) and has a simple method of installation that’s not going to cause any headaches. 
One last thing: When shopping for a PS5 NVMe, there’s no reason to buy a Gen5 model over a more affordable Gen4 model. As things stand, Sony’s console can’t take advantage of the new standard, and though Gen5 drives are backward compatible, they’re more expensive than their Gen4 counterparts. Just buy the fastest and highest-capacity Gen4 model you can afford. 
How to install an SSD into your PS5 
If you need guidance on how to install your new NVMe into your PS5 or PS5 Pro, we have a separate guide detailing all the steps here. Installation is pretty straightforward, but our how-to can help you if you&#39;re stuck. Just make note: Before attempting to add more storage via a PS5 SSD, ensure that you have Sony’s latest software installed.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/best-ssd-for-ps5-130004175.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F50a20500-d446-11f0-b767-014e12bc0e9e&resize=1400%2C840&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=ffac50a96145c63ea92a90ad096f73466f319096,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/best-ssd-for-ps5-130004175.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-26T10:00:35Z,13,Tech

Xiaomi's 17 Ultra Leica Edition smartphone comes with a manual zoom ring,"Xiaomi just launched its flagship 17 Ultra by Leica phone that may make you feel bad about your current device&#39;s cameras. Naturally it&#39;s a spec monster, with a 1-inch sensor 50MP f/1.67 main camera and 1/1.4-inch 200MP periscope telephoto camera. But it also offers an interesting new mechanical feature: a manual zoom ring that also activates the camera automatically when you rotate it.
Both the regular Xiaomi 17 Ultra and Leica edition come with a Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 SoC with up to 16GB of LPDDR5X RAM and 1TB of UFS 4.1 storage, along with a 6.9-inch 120Hz AMOLED display that can hit up to 3,500 nits of peak brightness. On top of the impressive main and telephoto lenses, they also offer a 50MP ultrawide and a 50MP selfie camera. And battery life shouldn&#39;t be an issue, thanks to the 6,800mAh silicon-carbon battery that supports 90 watt wired and 50 watt wireless charging.
Xiaomi
The 17 Ultra by Leica adds some very, well Leica touches. Those include a two-tone finish, red dot status symbol on front, textured edges and film simulations like Leica&#39;s Monopan 50 black and white. As for the zoom ring, Xiaomi says &#34;its rotation [eliminates] the need for tedious screen taps... and can detect displacements as small as 0.03mm.&#34; It can also be reprogrammed for functions like exposure compensation and manual focus. 
Other features unique to that model include a &#34;Leica Moments&#34; 3:2 aspect ratio, special encryption chip, and dual-satellite connection. And as befits a special edition, it comes in a custom box with a lens cap, lanyard, magnetic case and branded cleaning cloth.
The one caveat is the price. Where phones for the Chinese market are often cheaper than North American models, Xiaomi&#39;s 17 Ultra by Leica and the regular 17 Ultra start at CNY 7,999 ($1,140) and CNY 6,999 ($995) respectively with 512GB or storage and 16GB of RAM — right up there with the latest high-end Pixel 10 and Galaxy 25 models. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/xiaomis-17-ultra-leica-edition-smartphone-comes-with-a-manual-zoom-ring-093502893.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F6a406ff0-e234-11f0-b69d-d531011cf51b&resize=1400%2C795&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=a770ce30e48323f6801c764c5674d5470b05af41,https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/xiaomis-17-ultra-leica-edition-smartphone-comes-with-a-manual-zoom-ring-093502893.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-26T09:35:02Z,7,Tech

How to set up a PS5 for a child,"Setting up a PS5 for a child means you can offer an age-appropriate and safe platform for them to play. Sony made its parental control tools more comprehensive in recent years and they allow families to manage screen time, block unsuitable content, guide online interactions and approve purchases. The process is straightforward once the right menus are in view, but it helps to understand how each feature works before handing over the controller.
The system uses individual accounts for each family member, and these accounts determine what a child can access. A parent or guardian assigns restrictions to the child’s profile and the console enforces them more consistently than earlier PlayStation systems. The process begins with creating a child account, then linking it to the Family Management section of the adult account, and finally adjusting controls on the console itself.
Create a child account through Family Management
A child account is required before you can use any parental controls. This account is linked to the family manager’s PlayStation account and cannot be converted into an adult account until the child reaches the appropriate age under local regulations.
From the PS5 Home screen, navigate to Settings, Family and Parental Controls then choose Family Management. The system will request the family manager’s password before any changes can be made. Select Add Family Member and choose Add a Child. The console generates a QR code that opens a secure PlayStation webpage on a phone or browser. This page guides the setup process and ties the new account to the family group.
The form asks for the child’s date of birth first. Sony uses this to assign default age restrictions and to determine which features are allowed. A small credit card charge may be requested to verify the adult’s identity. The next steps involve entering an email address for the child, creating a password and selecting basic settings for content access, communication and spending. The child account must then be verified through a link sent to the provided email address. This ensures the account can use PlayStation Network features including any future purchases through the PlayStation Store.
Once complete, the new profile appears in the Family Management list on the PS5. This profile is now ready for fine-tuning.
Manage parental controls on the console
The PS5 keeps all parental controls in Family and Parental Controls within the main Settings menu. This section is organized into Playtime Settings, Content Restrictions, Communication and User-Generated Content and Spending controls. Each area can be adjusted separately for every child account in the family group.
How to set limits on playtime
Playtime controls help set boundaries for gaming sessions. Select the child’s profile, then open Playtime Settings. Limits can be set by total daily hours or by specific time windows. The console can be configured to notify the child when time is nearly up, or to log them out automatically once the limit is reached. These settings apply across the child’s account, so they remain active even if the child switches between PS5 consoles in the same household.
Parents can choose how strictly the system enforces these rules. For example, the console can continue to display warnings without blocking gameplay or it can stop activity when the allotted time ends. Playtime reports can also be viewed through the family manager’s PlayStation account or the PS App.
How to restrict content based on age ratings
Sony’s content filters are based on age ratings from the ESRB in the United States and equivalent regional boards in other countries. In Family Management, select the child’s profile and then select Parental Controls. Here, parents can set an age level for games. Titles above this level will not launch without approval from the family manager.
Blu-ray and DVD content can also be restricted and the system browser can be disabled entirely. If the family uses services that stream movies or TV shows through the console, those apps often apply their own content filters, but the PS5 can serve as a first line of control.
Engadget
How to manage communication and online interactions
Online communication can be limited to prevent unwanted contact. In Parental Controls, select Communication and User-Generated Content. This area controls messaging, voice chat, profile sharing and the ability to see or share player-created media such as screenshots and video clips.
Online play can also be adjusted. For younger kids, it may be helpful to block online multiplayer entirely until they better understand online etiquette and safety. For older children, communication can be limited to friends only. The PS5 respects these limits across all supported games.
How to set spending limits for purchases
A child account cannot use payment cards directly, but it can spend funds from the family manager’s wallet. Spending limits can be set in the child’s profile under Family Management. Parents can choose a monthly spending cap or block purchases altogether. Any attempt to exceed the limit requires approval from the family manager.
This feature covers games, add-ons, subscriptions and in-game currency. It ensures surprises on the credit card are less likely, especially in titles that promote quick digital purchases.
How to sign your child into the PS5
Once controls are set, the child can be added as a user on the console. Return to the home screen and select the user icon to switch users. Choose Add User, then select Get Started. Sign in using the child account’s email address and password.
The console guides the profile setup process and prompts for an online ID, avatar and privacy preferences. These steps help personalise the child’s space on the PS5. The system may request a locally created passcode that prevents access to parental controls without the family manager’s approval. This passcode should be unique and not shared with the child.
After setup is complete, the child will see a version of the PS5 tailored to the restrictions applied. Games that exceed the assigned age rating will appear with a lock icon and the console will block any actions that the family manager has limited.
Use the PS App and PlayStation’s online tools for ongoing management
Playtime and permissions can be managed remotely through Sony’s PS App or the PlayStation website. This makes it easier to adjust rules without taking over the TV. The app also provides notifications when playtime is running low or when the child attempts to access restricted content.
Sony’s Family Management tools synchronise across devices. Changes made from a phone appear on the PS5 within seconds. This helps maintain consistent rules, especially in homes with more than one console.
A child-ready PS5 is more than a restriction tool. It creates a safer environment for learning how to navigate digital spaces, interact with friends and handle screen time. Sony’s updated controls take much of the pressure off parents by enforcing rules in predictable ways that are difficult to bypass.

How to transfer your games to the Nintendo Switch 2,"Upgrading to the Switch 2 is a big step forward, thanks to the larger screen, new features and improved performance. But shifting to a new console naturally raises the question of what happens to all your games and save data on the one you already have. Thankfully, Nintendo has built a clear System Transfer process that lets you move your account, digital purchases, save files and other key data from your original Switch to the Switch 2. If you prepare ahead of time, you can be back to playing your favorite titles on new hardware in minutes.We’ll walk you through everything you need to know, including what transfers, how to start the process and what to check once you’re set up. Before you transfer: A quick checklistRunning through these steps first will save you time later:Charge your original Switch and your Switch 2, and keep them near each other.Connect to a stable Wi-Fi connection, as this is required to verify your Nintendo Account and manage redownloads.Update your original Switch by installing the latest system software so the transfer can run without interruptions.Confirm your Nintendo Account is linked, and each user you want to move is tied to a Nintendo Account.Most Switch titles work on Switch 2, but a few may have issues, so it’s worth checking Nintendo’s compatibility list ahead of time.Back up screenshots and videos if needed. These should transfer, but it never hurts to have your own copy.How to start the transfer of data from your old Switch to the Switch 2With your original Nintendo Switch to hand, navigate to System Settings, select Users then select Transfer Your User &amp; Save Data. Pick the user profile you want to move, confirm your Nintendo Account information and follow the on-screen prompts.Power on your Switch 2 and go through the initial setup. When the console asks if you want to transfer data from another system, select Start System Transfer. Make sure both consoles are connected to the same Wi-Fi network and remain powered on during the process.Once the Switch 2 detects your original console, it will guide you through pairing the systems for the transfer. After the connection is established the original Switch will begin sending your user information, save data and settings.When the transfer is complete, your new console will automatically log in using your Nintendo Account. Your digital games will appear in the Redownload section of the eShop so you can pull them onto your Switch 2 as needed.What to do after your transfer is completeOnce everything has moved to the Switch 2, there are a few final steps that help round out the process. You can redownload your digital games from the eShop and start reinstalling your favorites. Any controllers, Joy-Con or Bluetooth accessories you used with your original console will need to be paired again (provided they are Switch 2-compatible accessories), which only takes a minute. It’s also a good time to update your games to their latest versions and restore any parental controls or family group settings you had before. When you’re confident that all your data has transferred and everything is working as expected, you can then decide whether to keep your old console, hand it down or perform a factory reset if you plan to sell it.What data transfers to the Switch 2Nintendo’s System Transfer moves everything tied to your Nintendo Account, including digital games you’ve purchased, save data, user profiles, parental controls, system settings and screenshots and video captures. Your Nintendo Switch Online membership moves as well, and you’ll be able to immediately re-download your digital games on the Switch 2 once the transfer completes. Physical Switch game cards also work on the new console, though some titles may require patches or updates for the best performance. Nintendo has noted that a small number of older games may have temporary compatibility issues, but these are being reviewed.What data doesn’t transfer automaticallyA few settings won’t carry over on their own, so you may need to handle them manually once your Switch 2 is set up. Bluetooth pairing for controllers or headphones will need to be reconnected, since those device links stay tied to the original console. Your Wi-Fi passwords also won’t transfer, so you’ll have to sign in to your home network again. Some game-specific preferences, as well as language or region settings, may require another quick adjustment on the Switch 2, but these are simple to reconfigure and only take a few moments.Troubleshooting and other things to considerIf you run into issues while getting settled, a few common scenarios are worth keeping in mind. Some older titles may have temporary compatibility problems on the new console, so if a game behaves unexpectedly, check Nintendo’s updated compatibility list for known issues. You may also notice slower download speeds as the Switch 2 queues up your full library after the transfer. It helps to prioritize the games you want to play first so they can download ahead of the rest. Storage can also play a role. If you use a microSD card, wait until the system transfer is complete before inserting it into the new console, since the Switch 2 may need to reformat the card. And finally, don’t reset your old Switch right away. Keeping it powered on and accessible ensures you can confirm that all your saves and data made it across safely.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/how-to-transfer-your-games-to-the-nintendo-switch-2-130000702.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2Fca0b0760-20e7-11f0-bdfb-01b20d73cac9.jpeg&resize=1400%2C840&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=e1305b6dbe87475f018960b5ca4272a809a2ecaf,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/how-to-transfer-your-games-to-the-nintendo-switch-2-130000702.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-25T13:00:00Z,12,Tech

The best microSD cards in 2026,"Most microSD cards are fast enough for stashing photos, recording video and transferring files, but some will get you a little more bang for your buck than others. If you’re looking to boost the storage of your Nintendo Switch 2, Steam Deck, GoPro or any other device that still accepts microSD cards, we can help. We’ve thoroughly researched the market and several cards through a suite of benchmark tests. Here are the best that we’ve tested, along with some general advice on what to look for when buying a new card.

Best microSD Express cards for the Nintendo Switch 2 

 
 
 
  Jeff Dunn for Engadget
 
 
Read our full guide to the best microSD Express cards for the Nintendo Switch 2 
Let’s be clear about this: Unless you plan to own a Nintendo Switch 2 in the near future, you do not need a high-speed microSD Express card just yet. Nintendo’s gaming handheld is the only popular device that natively supports this standard right now, and microSD Express cards themselves are highly expensive compared to more traditional options. 
Still, if you do want to increase a Switch 2’s storage, they’re your only choice. Fortunately, determining exactly which model to buy for the console is pretty straightforward: Get whichever one you can find in stock, in the capacity you want, at a price you can stomach. 
We benchmarked several microSD Express cards for a separate Switch 2 guide, and for the most part, the performance differences between them weren’t great enough to justify paying extra for any particular model. Loading times weren’t quite identical with every test we ran, but the cards were extremely close in most games and common scenarios. The few times when there was a notable gap — fast-traveling to a particularly resource-heavy region in Cyberpunk 2077, for instance — the gulf between the slowest and fastest card was only ever about four or five seconds at most. That’s not nothing, but it’s also not something most people are likely to fret over unless they have a stopwatch handy. 

 
 
  The SanDisk microSD Express Card and Lexar Play Pro.
 
 
  Jeff Dunn for Engadget
 
 
The only time you’d notice a major speed difference is if you transfer games to your Express card from the Switch 2’s internal storage (and vice versa). In that case, the SanDisk microSD Express Card and Lexar Play Pro were generally the quickest, while PNY’s microSD Express Flash Memory Card had particularly slow write speeds. 
Moving Mario Kart World to the SanDisk and Lexar models, for example, took around four minutes and 35 seconds on average; with the PNY card, it took a little over seven minutes. That said, the PNY model was the fastest when it came to moving games back to the system storage. Walmart’s Onn microSD Express Card was significantly slower to move games from the card to system storage, but it’s also the most affordable card we’ve seen by a good distance. Either way, most people aren’t constantly shuffling their games back and forth like this. Performance in actual games is more important, and in that regard the results were consistently much tighter. 
What matters most is getting the most space for your budget. Unfortunately, stock for all microSD Express cards has been spotty since the Switch 2’s launch. For your convenience, we’ll list out all of the models we’ve tested thus far and their respective list prices below. Note that some lower-capacity versions — the 128GB SanDisk card, for one — advertise slower speeds than their more spacious counterparts. 
 
 SanDisk microSD Express Card: 128GB ($64), 256GB ($78), 512GB ($128) 
 Lexar Play Pro: 256GB ($60), 512GB ($120), 1TB ($220) 
 PNY microSD Express Flash Memory Card: 128GB ($48), 256GB ($62), 512GB ($124) 
 Samsung microSD Express Card for Nintendo Switch 2: 256GB ($60) 
 Samsung P9 Express: 256GB ($55), 512GB ($100) 
 GameStop Express microSD Card for Nintendo Switch 2: 256GB ($60), 512GB ($100), 1TB ($190) 
 Walmart Onn microSDXC Express Card: 256GB ($47), 512GB ($85)

  Jeff Dunn for Engadget
 
 
Broadly speaking, we recommend getting at least 256GB of storage, as Switch 2 games tend to have much larger file sizes than games for Nintendo’s previous handheld. But we also recommend holding off upgrading for as long as you can, if only because all of these cards should (tariff shenanigans aside) come down in price as time goes on. 
There’s no point in buying a microSD Express card for anything besides the Switch 2, but we did run the models above through our usual PC benchmarks as well. Unsurprisingly, they are miles faster than any traditional card on the market. 
With the 256GB SanDisk card, for instance, sequential read speeds checked in just under 900 MB/s in CrystalDiskMark and ATTO, while sequential writes topped out around 650 MB/s. Sustained writes speeds were slower (around 210 MB/s), but that was still fast enough to move our 12GB test file to the card in 52 seconds on average. It took a mere 20 seconds to read the file back to our PC. The write test with our smaller 1.15GB test folder, meanwhile, averaged just 4.5 seconds. 
It all adds up to performance that&#39;s at least twice as fast as the best UHS-I models we’ve tested in terms of sequential reads and writes, with three or four times the speeds in some cases. The gulf in random reads and writes is similar, and in some benchmarks even greater. But you need a pricey SD card reader to even see those increases on a PC, so only those with a Switch 2 in hand or serious cash to burn should consider one of these things. 
Other notable microSD cards 

 
 
 
Samsung Pro Ultimate 
The Samsung Pro Ultimate was the closest competitor to the Lexar Professional Silver Plus across our benchmark tests, but it&#39;s tangibly worse in terms of sequential write speeds, typically costs more and doesn’t offer a 1TB option. The Samsung Pro Plus is a bit slower for sequential reads, but it’s close enough otherwise and usually easier to find at a lower price. 
Lexar Professional Gold 
We haven&#39;t used it ourselves, but if you’re willing to pay for a more powerful UHS-II card built for heavy-duty video recording, the Lexar Professional Gold has tested well elsewhere and should deliver significantly faster sequential write speeds than our UHS-I picks above. It’s one of the few UHS-II cards we could actually find in stock, but it’s pricey, with a 128GB model normally priced in the $35 to $40 range. 

 
 
 
SanDisk Extreme 
The SanDisk Extreme effectively matched the Pro Plus in a few of our sequential tests, but that was partly due to us only being able to secure the 256GB model, which is higher-rated than the 128GB version. It’s a fine choice if you see it on sale at a reputable seller, but it’s broadly slower than our top pick and often costs more. 
SanDisk GamePlay 
The SanDisk GamePlay performs similarly to the SanDisk Extreme but costs a good bit extra as of our latest update. We couldn’t get it to reach its advertised speeds with the company’s own “Pro” card reader or other third-party options, so it fell short of our top picks. 
SanDisk Pokémon 
The SanDisk Pokémon does outperform its advertised read and write speeds, but not by enough to outpace the Lexar Silver Plus or Samsung Pro Plus. It essentially charges extra for having a picture of Pikachu (or Gengar, or Snorlax) on a product you’ll never look at. 

 
 
 
SanDisk Extreme Pro 
The SanDisk Extreme Pro is a close analog to the Samsung Pro Ultimate but, as of this writing, is either unavailable at most trusted retailers or priced too high by comparison. The Lexar Professional Silver Plus has faster sequential write speeds as well. 
PNY XLR8 Gaming 
The PNY XLR8 is an affordable card that comes with up to 512GB of space. Its sequential and random writes speeds checked in a little bit above those of Samsung’s Evo Select, plus it comes with a lifetime warranty. But its sequential reads were much, much slower, putting it out of contention. 
PNY Elite-X 
The PNY Elite-X often goes for cheap and wasn’t too far off the random read/write performance of Samsung&#39;s Pro Plus in CrystalDiskMark. Like the XLR8, it’s also slightly above the Evo Select in write speeds. But its sequential reads were too far behind all of our top picks, and it no longer appears to be available in capacities above 256GB. 
What to look for in a microSD card 
Capacity 
The first thing to figure out when buying a microSD card is how much storage space you need. Modern cards are commonly available in sizes ranging from 32GB to 512GB, with several models now available in 1TB or 1.5TB capacities as well. The first 2TB cards from major brands have started to arrive as well, which is exciting, but those are still fairly rare (and very expensive) by comparison. 
For many, a 128GB or 256GB model should be a sweet spot between price and storage space. But if you need more room — say, for stashing a bunch of games on a Steam Deck — a 512GB card or greater could make more sense and often provides a better cost-per-GB ratio.  
Pricing and stock levels are all over the place as of our most recent update thanks to ongoing AI-driven shortages, but you can typically still find a decent 128GB card for around $15, a good 256GB card for less than $30 and a solid 512GB card for around $40 (with faster models priced a little higher). There’s a starker increase when you go up to 1TB cards, which often cost closer to $100, though we’ve seen some fall into the $70 to $80 range over the last year. The first 2TB cards are a bigger leap: the 2TB SanDisk Extreme, for example, currently has a list price around $290, which is way up from what we saw in 2025. 
Note that a microSD card’s performance may differ depending on what capacity you buy. SanDisk says its 128GB Extreme card delivers sequential write speeds up to 90 MB/s, for example, while the higher-capacity models in the same line offer up to 130 MB/s. 
When we talk about microSD cards today, we mostly refer to cards that use the microSDXC (eXtended Capacity) standard, which have a capacity between 32GB and 2TB. Your device needs to support this for it to work with a microSDXC card. This will almost never be an issue these days, but some older devices (a Nintendo 3DS, for instance) are only compatible with microSDHC (High Capacity) cards, which range from 2GB to 32GB. 

 
 
 
Read and write speeds 
MicroSD cards are primarily judged on their read and write speeds, which are usually measured in megabytes per second (MB/s). Generally, most microSD cards have faster read speeds than write speeds. 
These metrics can then be broken down into sequential and random performance. Sequential read and write speeds matter when you’re trying to access (read) or save (write) long, constant streams of data, such as opening a large video or copying a big batch of files from a PC. If you want to use a microSD card for media storage, this is particularly important. Random performance, meanwhile, is about how quickly a card can read and write small files scattered throughout the device. 
Since random read/write speeds are much lower than sequential ones, storage device makers tend not to advertise them as loudly. But they’re important if you use a card with a gaming device or a single-board computer like the Raspberry Pi, where it often has to rapidly save and access small bits of data in random locations. 

 
 
 
Speed ratings 
If you look at a microSD card, you’ll see a buffet of numbers, letters and symbols. Most of these refer to the card’s speed class and performance ratings, which are determined by the SD Association. 
A card’s Video Speed Class, or V-rating, details its minimum sequential write speed, which is especially important when recording video from a camera. It ranges from V6 to V90. Most of the cards we tested had a V30 rating, so they have a sequential write speed of at least 30 MB/s. This should be enough to support up to 4K video at lower bitrates. Higher-rated V60 and V90 cards are usually better for capturing 8K, but they come at a much higher cost. 
The UHS Speed Class, or U-rating, also refers to a card’s minimum sequential write speed. It comes in two varieties: U3, which mandates a minimum of 30 MB/s, and U1, which is rated for 10 MB/s. 
The older Speed Class rating overlaps with the other two systems. It’s signified by a C symbol and goes from Class 2 to Class 10, with the number (again) indicating minimum sequential write speed. This rating is less relevant nowadays, but you may still see a “C10” logo on some cards. 
The Application Performance spec, marked by an A symbol, is an indicator of random read/write speeds. This is measured in IOPS, or input/output operations per second, rather than MB/s. There are two categories here: A1 cards offer a minimum random read speed of 1,500 IOPS and a minimum random write speed of 500 IOPS, while A2 cards bump those up to 4,000 IOPS and 2,000 IOPS, respectively. Both ratings also guarantee sequential write speeds of at least 10 MB/s. 
To keep it simple, most people should look for a card with V30, U3 and A2 ratings. It’s totally possible to get a solid card without those: A U1 card might be worth it if you just need a cheap, high-capacity option, for example. V60 and V90 cards are worth a look if you’re serious about shooting high-resolution photos and video as well. But overall, cards with the certifications above should provide the best blend of price and performance today. 
It’s important to emphasize that these ratings are baselines. Most V30 cards offer significantly higher write speeds than 30 MB/s, for instance, and some A1 cards can outperform some A2 models in practice. The speeds advertised by manufacturers aren’t always 100 percent accurate, either: Sometimes the card will be slower in real-world use, other times it may actually be a bit faster.

UHS bus speeds 
The other spec to note is the card’s bus interface. Most microSD cards available today are UHS-I, which has a theoretical maximum speed of 104 MB/s. There are also UHS-II cards, which have an extra row of pins on the back and can reach up to 312 MB/s. (A UHS-III standard technically exists as well but hasn’t seen wide adoption.) These are labeled on the card with a Roman numeral I or II. 
UHS-II cards are typically the ones with those higher V60 or V90 ratings. If you shoot lots of 4K to 8K video or frequently use burst mode to capture ultra high-res photos, the performance gains of a good UHS-II card can save you time. 
However, these are typically much more expensive than UHS-I cards: This 128GB Lexar Professional Gold model, for instance, is a relative bargain at $35. While that&#39;s less than many UHS-II models we’ve seen in the past, it&#39;s still more than double the common street price of our top pick above. You need a device that’s compatible with the UHS-II interface to see any benefits, too, and stock for UHS-II cards is often spottier. For now, the higher speeds aren’t worth the price premium for most people, so we stuck mostly to UHS-I cards with our recommendations. 

 
 
  Unlike traditional UHS-I cards, a microSD Express card like the SanDisk model on the right comes with a second row of pins to enable its improved performance.

microSD Express and the Nintendo Switch 2 
The absolute fastest microSD cards you can buy, however, are based on a different interface called SD Express. This has technically been around for several years and now includes its own subset of speed classes, but the gist is that it&#39;s much faster than UHS-I or UHS-II: SanDisk’s recently released microSD Express card, one of the first commercially available models, advertises sequential read speeds up to 880MB/s. That’s quicker than some older SSDs. 
It’s a substantial upgrade that has largely held up in our testing, but very few popular devices natively support SD Express today. The first major exception is the Nintendo Switch 2, which is only compatible with the newer standard, as it’s needed to keep up with the performance demands of new handheld games. 
Besides SanDisk, manufacturers like Samsung, Lexar and PNY have already launched microSD Express cards to go with the console. The presumption is that having such a popular device embrace the tech will only further its adoption and drive prices down. 
But it’s still early days, and right now all microSD Express cards cost much more than the best UHS-I or even UHS-II options. Beyond the Switch 2, it’s possible to take advantage of these cards’ superior speeds with a dedicated SD Express card reader, but that adds even more to the final cost. It’s also worth noting that SD Express cards are not backwards compatible with UHS-II (or UHS-III), so if you try to plug one into a device with a UHS-II slot, it’ll be limited to UHS-I speeds. Still, they’re a must for Nintendo fans going forward, and the tech should have plenty of appeal if more gadgets that support the interface do arrive.  
For more on how the first wave of Express cards perform on the Switch 2, we&#39;ve put together a dedicated buying guide just for Nintendo&#39;s console.  

 
 
 
A note on card readers and reaching advertised speeds 
While the UHS-I interface has a theoretical maximum of 104 MB/s, some UHS-I cards can exceed that speed through proprietary extensions. However, you need a compatible card reader and host device to take advantage of that extra performance. If you find a UHS-I card advertising speeds higher than 104 MB/s, this is what’s going on. You can see these limits in action with an original Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck: Both of those gaming devices support the UHS-I interface but don’t go beyond its official speed, flattening any sequential gains some cards may have elsewhere. (Differences in random read and write speeds can still matter, though.) The same thing will happen if you plug a more powerful UHS-II or SD Express card into a device that doesn’t accept those interfaces. 
The takeaway: Your microSD card will only be as fast as the slowest link in your chain. 
Warranty 
Many microSD cards are designed to be durable, with protection from water, extreme temperatures, X-rays and drops. Still, in case of catastrophe, a long warranty is always good to have. Many manufacturers offer lifetime or 10-year limited warranties, though we’ve noticed that “endurance” cards marketed to withstand more hours of writing are usually covered for a shorter period of time. For example, Samsung&#39;s Pro Endurance, a model aimed at security cameras and other monitoring devices, comes with a five-year warranty. 
Avoiding counterfeits 
The memory card market has had a particular problem with scammers selling fake products. To guard against this, only buy from a known brand and a reputable retailer such as Best Buy, B&amp;H Photo or Adorama. If you shop at Amazon, only buy if the shipper and seller is Amazon.com. (That said, a handful of users have reported receiving counterfeits even from Amazon directly in the past, so exercise caution.) Remember: If a price seems too good to be true, it probably is. Be wary of any retailer offering a significantly lower price than everyone else. 
Once you receive a card, check its packaging for any irregularities. You can run benchmark tests like CrystalDiskMark or BlackMagic Disk Speed Test to verify its speeds aren’t drastically lower than what’s advertised (or possible, given its specs). You can also use software that’s designed to verify the true capacity and performance of your card, such as H2testw and FakeFlashTest.

How we test microSD cards 
We&#39;ve put about 20 microSD cards through a series of tests to verify their sequential and random performance. These included benchmarks like CrystalDiskMark, BlackMagic Disk Speed Test, ATTO Disk Benchmark and AJA System Test, as well as a few “real-world” tests. We copied and pasted a small folder of photos about 1.15GB in size to and from each card, then did the same with a larger 12.2GB folder containing multiple file types and subfolders, timing the process each time. We also checked how each card performed on the Steam Deck, downloading games of varying sizes — including Stardew Valley, Aperture Desk Job, Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance and Apex Legends — then timing how long it took to launch each game and load save files. We do multiple runs of each test to verify our findings and account for potential outliers.  
Where applicable, we used a Kingston USB 3.2 UHS-II reader to test each card on both Windows 11 and macOS Sequoia. However, if a card could be bundled with (or is specifically advertised to use) a proprietary reader, we mainly tested with that, since we figure that’s the one most interested buyers will end up using. For Windows testing, we used an Alienware gaming PC with an Intel Core i9-10900F, Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 GPU, 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. For macOS, we used a 2021 16-inch MacBook Pro with an Apple M1 Pro chip, 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. If a reader couldn’t connect over USB-C, we used CalDigit’s TS4 dock to test the corresponding card on the MacBook. 
We tested the 128GB version of each card whenever we could, though we were only able to test higher-capacity models for a few options. We also reformatted each card before testing with the SD Association’s Memory Card Formatter tool. 
For microSD Express cards, we ran each model through a series of tests specific to the Switch 2, since that is the only popular device that actually supports the tech. You can read more about that process in our separate buying guide linked above. 
Recent updates 
December 2025: We’ve tested the Samsung P9 Express microSD Express card and noted it in our Switch 2 section above. We’ve also made a few edits to highlight recent price increases and stock shortages driven by the ongoing AI boom. 
November 2025: We’ve tested Walmart’s Onn microSD Express Card and edited our notes on the best cards for the Nintendo Switch 2 accordingly. 
September 2025: We’ve fleshed out our advice on buying a microSD Express card for the Nintendo Switch 2.

CERN: how does the international research institution manage risk?,"
		
					  
						




There are few research institutions in the world with the size and scope of the European Organization for Nuclear Research, CERN. Founded in 1954 by 12 European countries, the European Laboratory for Elementary Particle Physics is located in the Swiss town of Meyrin, in the canton of Geneva, although its facilities extend along the Franco-Swiss border. Among them is the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the world’s largest particle accelerator. International collaboration is at the core of its origin: more than 3,500 people make up its permanent staff. A small village that expands to 17,000 when adding the scientific staff of around 950 institutions from more than 80 different countries that collaborate on projects at the center. In this homegrown ecosystem, IT risk management poses a challenge.



“The main problem is that we are managing a huge organization,” explains Stefan Lüders, CERN’s CISO. “We are one of the most important particle physics research institutes on the planet. We do sophisticated and interesting things, which makes us a target for attacks from different communities.” He lists several of these potential threats: script kiddies or hackers with basic knowledge, who all pose a potential security risk; ransomware or data exfiltration; sabotage of CERN’s work; espionage actions and criminal groups trying to infiltrate through computers or other devices.



“This is where people come in. Because we have a very large, heterogeneous and very fluctuating research community. There are many physicists who join the organization every year. They come in and leave to do their PhD, do research at CERN and then leave,” he describes, pointing to the challenge of “taking care of this community of users. The other challenge is the flexible and fast-developing world of IT.” This includes programming — importing open-source libraries, their security, etc. — and AI. “The more sophisticated AI becomes, the greater the likelihood that those AI-driven security or attack tools will try to infiltrate the organization.”



Securing CERN



How do you ensure effective implementation of cybersecurity initiatives that don’t disrupt scientific work? “You can’t,” Lüders asserts. “Cybersecurity is inconvenient. Let’s face it.” Lüders equates it to locking your front door or using your PIN to get cash out of the ATM; they can be annoying, but necessary. “We try to explain to our community why security measures are needed,” he says. “And if we adapt our security measures to our environment, people adopt them. Yes, it makes the research a little more complicated, but only a little.”



Lüders insists on the research work factor. “We are not a bank. We don’t have billions of dollars. We are not a military base, which means we don’t have to protect a country. We do research, which means adapting the level of security and the level of academic freedom so that the two go hand in hand. And that’s an ongoing conversation with our user community.” This ranges from scientific personnel to industrial control systems management, IT or human resources. “To meet this challenge, it is essential to talk to people. That’s why, I insist, cybersecurity is a very sociological issue: talking to people, explaining to them why we do this.” 



For example, not everyone willingly uses multifactor authentication because “let’s face it, they’re a pain. It’s much easier to type in a password, and who even wants to type in a password? You just want to log in. But for protection needs, today we have passwords and multifactor authentication. So you explain to people what you’re protecting. We tell them why it’s important to protect their work, as well as research results. And the vast majority understand that you need a certain level of security,” he says. “But it’s a challenge because there are so many different cultures here, different nationalities, different opinions and thoughts, and different backgrounds. That’s what we are constantly trying to adapt to.”


Stefan Lüders and Tim Bell of CERN.CERN



Employing proprietary technology can introduce risks, according to Tim Bell, leader of CERN’s IT governance, risk and compliance section, who is responsible for business continuity and disaster recovery. “If you’re a visitor to a university, you’ll want to bring your laptop and use it at CERN. We can’t afford to remove these electronic devices upon arrival at the facility. It would be incompatible with the nature of the organization. The implication is that we must be able to implement BYOD-type security measures.”



Because at the core of everything always remains the collaborative nature of CERN. “Academic papers, open science, freedom of research, are part of our core. Cybersecurity needs to adapt to this,” Lüders notes. “We have 200,000 devices on our network that are BYOD.” How then does the adaptation of cyber protection apply? “It’s called defense in depth,” explains the CISO. “We can’t install anything on these end devices because they don’t belong to us, (…) but we have network monitoring.” In this way, even if you don’t have direct access to each device, you are warned when something is being done against the center’s policies, both at the level of cybersecurity and inappropriate uses, such as employing the technology they provide for particular interests.”



These measures also extend to obsolete systems, which the organization is able to assimilate because they have a network resilient enough that even if one piece of equipment is compromised, it won’t damage any other CERN systems. The legacy technology problem extends to the equipment needed for the physics experiments being performed at the center. “These are protected by dedicated networks, which allows the network protection to kick in and protect them against any kind of abuse,” Lüders explains. On IoT connected devices not designed with cybersecurity in mind, “a problem for all industries,” Lüders is blunt: “You will never get security in IoT devices.” His solution is to connect them to restricted network segments where they are not allowed to communicate with anything else, and then define destinations to which they can communicate.



General framework



This is part of a larger challenge: aligning the IT and OT sides so that security continuity is established throughout the organization. A challenge that goes through centralization. “Today the OT part, the controls systems at CERN, are using IT virtualization,” explains Lüders. “The strategy is to bring IT and control people together so that the control people can use the IT services to their advantage. From the technology department, a central system is provided with different functionalities for operations, as well as for other areas of the organization, accessible through a single point of entry. “That’s the power of centralization.” This system also includes new tools such as AI tools in LLM, where they have a working group in place to find the best way to employ them. “We are facing a big discovery and, later on, we will centralize it through a central IT service. And that’s how we do it with all technologies.”



Just as the subjects they research at CERN are evolving, so is their IT governance framework. This has been keeping up with industry developments, Bell explains, hand in hand with audits that allow it to operate according to best practice. “The governance part is becoming more formal. In general, everything was well organized; it was just a matter of standardizing it and developing policy frameworks around it.” Despite the establishment of these standards, the result is the opposite of rigid, explains Bell, who exemplifies this with the case of a recent cybersecurity audit in which CERN was assessed against one of the international standards, which served to improve the level of maturity. “We are adopting a fairly flexible IT governance policy, learning from the experience of others in adopting industry standards.”

Eufy just revealed a tech-heavy baby bottle washer at CES,"Anker&#39;s sub-brand Eufy just revealed a high-tech baby bottle washer at CES 2026. The Bottle Washer S1 is filled to the brim with nifty features that should please frazzled parents.
It&#39;s been designed to clean deeper than rival models. The Bottle Washer S1 features a built-in water softener, a first in the product category, which should help remove stubborn minerals. It also includes proprietary HydroBlast technology that cleans baby bottles from every angle. This is assisted by the inclusion of a multi-layer rotating spray.
It sterilizes up to 212 degrees Fahrenheit and dries in just 40 minutes. These are both fantastic metrics for baby bottle washers. It also holds more bottles than comparable units, with the ability to clean eight bottle sets at once.
Anker/Eufy 
The device allows for complete app control, which lets users set cleaning schedules and perform simple maintenance routines. After cleaning, it can keep bottle sets in a sterile standby mode for up to 72 hours. This really looks like the best bottle washer out there, but quality comes at a price.

Steam and Valve's online games are down,"Steam is experiencing an outage that’s impacting users ability to access the game store and play games online. Valve hasn’t acknowledged the outage publicly, but SteamDB’s unofficial Steam Status page reports that the Steam Store, Steam Community, and Steam Web APIs are all offline.DownDetector received over 6,000 outage reports around 1:15PM ET, and Steam is also inaccessible from Valve’s mobile apps. The outage appears to be affecting APIs for Valve’s online games, like Team Fortress 2, Dota 2 and Counterstrike 2, as well.Steam’s last major outage was in October, when the store and online services were unavailable for an hour. Earlier in September, the launch of Hollow Knight: Silksong temporarily took down Steam, the Xbox Store and Nintendo’s eShop due to how many people tried to download the game at the same time.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/steam-and-valves-online-games-are-down-191033978.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-09%2F3809b8f0-9975-11f0-bbdf-ec530b745628&resize=1400%2C779&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=3b5a6a88269f5ff7e4a4299f31dbe2dcf19cc90c,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/steam-and-valves-online-games-are-down-191033978.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-24T19:10:33Z,7,Tech
Today's the last day to get $100 off the PS5 and PS5 Pro,"Back in November, Sony started selling PS5 consoles at a $100 discount as part of a Black Friday/Cyber Monday promotion. The deal officially sunsets at 3AM ET, so now is a good time to bite the bullet on a gaming console given that prices aren&#39;t likely to go down anytime soon. 
You can pick up a regular disc-based PS5 for $450 and a digital model for $400. The beefy PS5 Pro is available for $650. All of these deals are active on Amazon, but also directly from Sony. 
If the costs here still sound a bit high, that&#39;s because Sony raised console prices by $50 back in August. In other words, these $100 discounts are pretty much $50 discounts when factoring in that recent increase. Still, cheaper is cheaper. This puts the digital PS5 at the same price as an Xbox Series S and the disc-based version at the same price as a Switch 2. 
Both standard PS5 configurations won&#39;t arrive until December 28. The PS5 Pro, however, is available for same-day shipping if you&#39;re jonesing for one last holiday gift. 
The PS5 has a fairly large stable of exclusive titles made by Sony-owned studios. These include games like Horizon Forbidden West, Astro Bot, Death Stranding 2 and Ghost of Yotei.

The best live TV streaming services to cut cable in 2026,"Price hikes, media consolidation and contract disputes that turn channels dark have made live TV streaming services feel a lot more like cable. But, for most people it’s still a better deal to cut the cord. For sports fans and news junkies, there’s still no better option than one of the best live TV streaming services. We tried all the major players and currently recommend YouTube TV for most people. But we also spelled out just what you get from other providers (along with what we think about them) so you can decide for yourself.Editor’s note: YouTube TV will start offering genre-specific plans in early 2026. We don’t have word on the pricing or specifics yet, but will update this guide when we do. Fans looking to watch Christmas football games will need access to Netflix as well as Prime Video. We’ve detailed the schedule in the NFL streaming section below.

How to stream live NFL games 
The rights to air regular-season NFL games belong to a number of networks. Around 200 games are scheduled to appear Sundays on CBS/Paramount+ and Fox/Fox One. NBC/Peacock will host one Sunday night competition each week while Prime Video will air Thursday night contests (except for Thanksgiving week) and ABC/ESPN will show Monday night matchups. A few games will be exclusive to the NFL Network and Christmas-day games will air live on Netflix. YouTube aired a single week-one game. You can see the complete NFL schedule here (the airing network appears just below the game time on the list). 
On many Sundays, multiple games are scheduled to air at the same time by the same broadcaster. That means Fox and CBS will broadcast regional games through the associated local affiliate station. Select national games will air through Fox One and Paramount+. To see all Sunday (daytime) matchups, you’ll need the NFL Sunday Ticket that’s now exclusive to YouTube TV and costs between $35 and $115 per month depending on the type of subscription you choose (YouTube recently announced monthly options for the Sunday Ticket). Note that the subscription doesn’t include Sunday night games — for that, you’ll need Peacock and/or local NBC station access through YouTube TV or elsewhere. 
Most of the paid live TV streaming services we recommend here include the stations you’ll need to see most of the games. YouTube TV, Fubo TV (including the new, cheaper Fubo Sports package), Hulu + Live TV and DirecTV (Signature packages and MySports Genre packs) offer local Fox, CBS, ABC and NBC stations in most (but not all areas). They also carry sports-focused channels from those networks, like Fox Sports, CBS Sports and ESPN. Sling’s Orange plan includes access to a few local channels (varying by area), and also carries ESPN, but you’ll need the combined Orange and Blue plan to also get the Fox Sports channel — but neither plan carries CBS Sports. 
How to watch Christmas pro football 
Viewers looking to watch games on Christmas day and the weekend after will need more than just a live TV streaming service. Two games on December 25 will air on Netflix. You can catch the Dallas Cowboys play the Washington Commanders at 1PM ET, followed by the Detroit Lions and Minnesota Vikings at 4:30PM ET. The third game will air on Prime Video as part of its regular Thursday Night Football programming and will showcase the Denver Broncos versus the Kansas City Chiefs at 8:15PM ET. 
Friday is football-free, but the following Saturday, the Houston Texans and Los Angeles Chargers game will air on the NFL Network — which is carried by YouTube TV, Hulu+ Live TV, Fubo, DirectTV and Sling Blue and Select. 
How can I stream NFL games for free? 
If you have a digital antenna hooked up to your TV, you can grab games that are broadcast over the airways for your region by tuning into your local CBS, Fox, NBC and ABC stations. You can buy a digital antenna for between $20 and $60. Of course, that won’t get you the games that are exclusive to the NFL Network, Prime Video or Netflix, and you won’t be able to watch games broadcast outside your area. 
Nearly all paid live TV streaming services are currently offering free trials ranging from a few days to a week. You could hop from service to service, catching a few games before cancelling and not pay anything, but with 18 weeks in the regular season, you’ll obviously not be able to watch all games for free. 
Alternatively, you can check out your local sports bar and watch a game for the price of a soda and maybe some nachos. As it turns out, bars and restaurants that provide those games to customers have to pay a ton of cash to do so, so you may as well take advantage of the opportunity. 
Does Paramount Plus stream live NFL games? 
Yes. Paramount owns CBS, which has historically held the rights to air many NFL games each season. This year, NFL on CBS includes more than 100 regular-season games, most of them Sunday matchups. You can see which NFL games will air on CBS/Paramount + here. Note that to watch your local CBS station you need Paramount+ Premium (formerly Paramount+ with Showtime) for $13 per month. 
Can you stream live football on YouTube? 
September 5, 2025 marked the first time YouTube was an official live NFL broadcaster when it aired a Friday night, week-one game of the 2025 NFL season from São Paulo, Brazil. It pit the Los Angeles Chargers against the Kansas City Chiefs (LA won 21-27) and aired worldwide on YouTube for free as well as for subscribers to YouTube TV. 
There are no other plans for YouTube to air live NFL games for the 2025 season for free, but paid YouTube TV customers will be able to watch many live matchups on their local CBS, Fox, NBC and ABC stations as part of their subscription. Both YouTube TV subscribers and anyone with the YouTube app can subscribe to the NFL Sunday Ticket add-on for $35 to $60 monthly, depending on promotions. Through the YouTube app, you can also purchase access to other Primetime Channels including Paramount+, but it costs the same as paying for those accounts directly.

Best free live TV streaming services for 2026 
There are loads of ways to get free TV these days. To start, many standard streaming apps have added live components to their lineups — even Netflix. Peacock Premium Plus subscriptions include regional NBC stations. Paramount+ Premium subscribers can watch on-air CBS programming. The new Fox One service includes multiple live Fox stations. True, if you’re already paying for a service it’s not technically “free” but at least the live content isn’t extra. 
The smart TV operating system (OS) you use likely provides free live content too: Amazon’s Fire TV, Google/Android TV, Roku’s built-in Roku Channel and Samsung’s TV Plus all have hundreds of live channels and original programming. Some of the paid services we recommend above have a free version — namely Sling Freestream, Fubo Free (available after you cancel) and DirecTV’s MyFree. But if you’re looking for more, here are the best free ad-supported TV (FAST) apps with live TV that we tried:

What to look for in a live TV streaming service 
How to stream live TV 
Streaming live TV is a lot like using Netflix. You get access through apps on your phone, tablet, smart TV or streaming device and the signal arrives over the internet. A faster and more stable connection tends to give you a better experience. Most live TV apps require you to sign up and pay via a web browser. After that, you can activate the app on all of your devices. 
Monthly Price 
When I started testing these cord-cutting alternatives, I was struck by the price difference between live TV and a standard video streaming app. Where the latter cost between $5 and $20 per month, most live TV services hit the $80 mark and can go higher than $200 with additional perks, channel packages and premium extras. The higher starting price is mostly due to the cost of providing multiple networks — particularly sports and local stations. And, in the past year or so, every service has raised base plan prices. 
Local channels 
Only two of the services I tried don’t include full local channel coverage for subscribers and one of those makes no effort to carry sports at all. That would be Philo and, as you might guess, it’s the cheapest. The next most affordable option, Sling, only carries three local stations — and only in larger markets — but it still manages to include some of the top sports channels. 
When you sign up with any provider that handles local TV, you’ll enter your zip code, ensuring you get your area’s broadcast affiliates for ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC. Of course, you can also get those stations for free. Nearly all modern television sets support a radio frequency (RF) connection, also known as the coaxial port, which means if you buy an HD antenna, you’ll receive locally broadcast stations like ABC, CBS, PBS, FOX and NBC. And since the signal is digital, reception is much improved over the staticky rabbit-ears era. 
But local channel access is another area where traditional streaming services, like Netflix, are bleeding into broadcast territory. For example, you can watch your local NBC station with a Peacock subscription and you can tune into your area’s CBS station through your Paramount+ subscription. Netflix is even getting into the mix with a recently announced deal with one of France’s broadcast companies, TF1. The streaming service will now air TF1&#39;s live TV channels and on-demand content inside the Netflix app. No word if the concept will expand to other regions, but it’s an interesting move to anyone interested in the future of streaming. 
Live sports coverage 
One reality that spun my head was the sheer number and iterations of sports networks in existence. Trying to figure out which network will carry the match-up you want to see can be tricky. I found that Google makes it a little easier for sports fans by listing out upcoming games (just swap in NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL and so on in the search bar). When you click an event, the “TV &amp; streaming” button will tell you which network is covering it. 
That just leaves figuring out if your chosen service carries the RSNs (regional sports networks) you want. Unfortunately, even with add-ons and extra packages, some providers simply don’t have certain channels in their lineups. It would take a lawyer to understand the ins and outs of streaming rights negotiations, and networks leave and return to live TV carriers all the time. That said, most major sporting events in the US are covered by ESPN, Fox Sports, TNT, USA and local affiliates. 
I should also point out that traditional streaming services have started adding live sports to their lineups. Peacock carries live Premier League matches, Sunday Night Football games and aired the 2024 Olympic Games from Paris. Thursday Night Football as well as NBA and WNBA games are on Amazon Prime and Christmas Day Football airs on Netflix. HBO Max (formerly, er, HBO Max) now airs select, regular season games from the NHL, MLB, NCAA and NBA with a $10-per-month add-on.  
You can watch MLS games with an add-on through the Apple TV app, and Apple TV+ (now just called Apple TV) includes some MLB games. Roku users can watch the just-added free sports channel and those who subscribe to Paramount Plus can see many of the matches aired on CBS Sports, including live NFL games. In 2025, January&#39;s Super Bowl was live-streamed for free on Tubi. While all of these alternatives may not cover as much ground as live TV streamers, they could end up being cheaper avenues to the sports you want. 
And if sports is all you’re after, there are sports-only plans that are a touch cheaper, too. The promised sports streaming service from ESPN, Fox and Warner Bros. called Venu was cancelled early this year. But on August 21, ESPN launched its own streaming service that includes all ESPN channels and costs $30 per month. Fubo Sports is $56 monthly and includes local broadcast stations from ABC, CBS and FOX plus a slew of sports networks (CBS Sport and FS1 among them) as well as all networks included with ESPN Unlimited.   
Fox launched its own standalone service in August as well and it includes Fox Sports and all other Fox properties (News, Business, Weather) for $20 monthly. DirecTV also has a $70-per-month, sports-only streaming package called MySports and Comcast has a sports and news bundle for that same price (as long as you&#39;re an Xfinity customer with auto-pay, otherwise it&#39;s more expensive). 
Traditional cable networks 
Dozens of linear programming networks were once only available with cable TV, like Bravo, BET, Food Network, HGTV, CNN, Lifetime, SYFY and MTV. If you only subscribe to, say, Netflix or Apple TV+, you won’t have access to those. But as with sports, standard streamers are starting to incorporate this content into their offerings. After the Warner Bros. merger, Max incorporated some content from HGTV, Discovery and TLC. Peacock has Bravo and Hallmark shows, and Paramount+ has material from Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy Central. 
Other entertainment channels like AMC+ have stand-alone apps. The Discovery+ app gives you 15 channels ad-free for $10 per month (or with ads for $6 monthly). And a service called Frndly TV starts at a mere $7 per month and streams A&amp;E, Lifetime, Game Show Network, Outdoor Channel and about 35 others. Of course, most live TV streaming options will deliver more sizable lists of cable networks, but just note that you may already be paying for some of them — and if all you need is a certain channel, you could get it cheaper by subscribing directly. 
On-demand streaming 
Most live TV subscriptions include access to a selection of video-on-demand (VOD) content, like you would get with a traditional streaming service. Much of this content is made up of the movies and TV series that have recently aired on your subscribed networks. This typically doesn’t cover live events and news programming, but I was able to watch specific episodes of ongoing shows like Top Chef or BET’s Diarra from Detroit. Just search the on-demand library for the program, pick an episode and hit play. 
Partnerships, like Hulu’s relationship with Disney, and add-ons, such as bundling Max with your YouTube TV subscription or Starz with your Sling plan, will let you watch even larger libraries of on-demand content. But again, if VOD is all you’re after, paying for those networks directly instead of through a live TV plan will be far cheaper. 
Digital video recordings (DVR) limits 
Every option I tried offers some cloud DVR storage without needing a separate physical device. You’ll either get unlimited storage for recordings that expires after nine months or a year, or you’ll get a set number of hours (between 50 and 1,000) that you can keep indefinitely. Typically, all you need to do is designate what ongoing TV series you want to record and the DVR component will do all the hard work of saving subsequent episodes for you to watch later. You can do the same thing with sports events. 
Aside from being able to watch whenever it’s most convenient, you can also fast-forward through commercials in recorded content. In contrast, you can’t skip them on live TV or VOD. 
Simultaneous streams and profiles per account 
Each plan gives you a certain number of simultaneous streams, aka how many screens can play content at the same time. And while most providers will let you travel with your subscription, there are usually location restrictions that require you to sign in from your home IP address periodically. Stream allowances range from one at a time to unlimited screens (or as many as your ISP’s bandwidth can handle). Some plans require add-ons to get more screens. 
Most services also let you set up a few profiles so I was able to give different people in my family the ability to build their own watch histories and libraries, set their favorite channels and get individual recommendations. 
Picture-in-picture mode and multiview 
Picture-in-picture (PiP) usually refers to shrinking a video window on a mobile device or computer browser so you can watch it while using other apps. Sling, YouTube TV, FuboTV, Philo, DirecTV Stream and Hulu + Live TV all have PiP modes on computers and mobile devices.  
Another feature, multiview, lets you view multiple (usually four) sports matches or other live content at once on your TV screen. YouTube TV, FuboTV and now DirecTV all let you do this. With YouTube TV, you can select up to four views from a few preset selection of streams. FuboTV offers the same feature, but only if you&#39;re using an Apple TV or Roku streaming device. DirecTV lets you do so through “mixes” which include sports, news, business and kids variants with a set four channels in each mix. 
4K live streams 
Right now, just FuboTV, YouTube TV and DirecTV Stream offer 4K live streams — but with caveats. YouTube TV requires a $20-per-month add-on, after which you’ll only be able to watch certain live content in 4K. DirecTV Stream has three channels that show live 4K content — one with shows and original series, and two with occasional sporting events. You don’t have to pay extra for these but you do need to have either DirecTV’s Gemini receiver, or a device from Fire TV, Apple TV or Roku. You’ll need those same streaming devices to watch the select 4K programming on Sling as well. FuboTV shows certain live events in 4K but access is limited to the Elite and Premier packages, not the base-level Pro plan. 
Of course, watching any 4K content also requires equipment that can handle it: a 4K smart TV or 4K streaming device paired with a cord and screen that can handle 4K resolution. 
Tiers, packages and add-ons 
Comparing price-to-offering ratios is a task for a spreadsheet. I… made three. The base plans range from $28 to $85 per month. From there, you can add packages, which are usually groups of live TV channels bundled by themes like news, sports, entertainment or international content. Premium VOD extras like Max, AMC+ and Starz are also available. Add-ons cost an extra $5 to $20 each per month and simply show up in the guide where you find the rest of your live TV. This is where streaming can quickly get expensive, pushing an $80 subscription to $200 monthly, depending on what you choose. 
How to stream live TV for free 
I also downloaded and tried out a few apps that offer free ad-supported TV (FAST) including Freevee, Tubi, PlutoTV and Sling Freestream. These let you drop in and watch a more limited selection of live networks at zero cost. Most don’t even require an email address, let alone a credit card. And if you have a Roku device, an Amazon Fire TV or Stick, a Samsung TV, a Chromecast device or a Google TV, you already have access to hundreds of live channels via the Roku Channel, the live tab in Fire TV, through the Samsung TV Plus app or through Google TV.

How we tested live TV streaming services 
When I begin testing for a guide, I research the most popular and well-reviewed players in the category and narrow down which are worth trying. For the paid plans, just six services dominate so I tried them all. There are considerably more free live TV contenders so I tested the four most popular. After getting accounts set up using my laptop, I downloaded the apps on a Samsung smart TV running the latest version of Tizen OS. I counted the local stations and regional sports coverage, and noted how many of the top cable networks were available. I then weighed the prices, base packages and available add-ons. 
I then looked at how the programming was organized in each app’s UI and judged how easy everything was to navigate, from the top navigation to the settings. To test the search function, I searched for the same few TV shows on BET, Food Network, HGTV and Comedy Central, since all six providers carry those channels. I noted how helpful the searches were and how quickly they got me to season 6, episode 13 of Home Town. 
I used DVR to record entire series and single movies and watched VOD shows, making sure to test the pause and scan functions. On each service with sports, I searched for the same four upcoming NHL, NBA, MLS and NCAA basketball matches and used the record option to save the games and play them back a day or two later. Finally, I noted any extra perks or irritating quirks.

Live TV Streaming FAQs 
What is live streaming? 
Streaming simply refers to video content that is delivered to your screen over the internet. Live streaming can be split into two categories: linear programming and simultaneous transmission. That first one is similar to what you get with cable or broadcast TV, with channels that play a constant flow of movies and shows (sort of what TV looked like before Netflix). Simultaneous streaming lets you watch live events (like a basketball game) or a program (like the evening news) as they happen. 
What is the difference between streaming and live streaming? 
Standard streaming, the most popular example being Netflix, lets you pick what you want to watch from a menu of choices. It’s also referred to as “video on demand.” Live streaming refers to sports and news events that you can stream as they happen in real time. It also refers to channels that show a continuous, linear flow of programming. 
What streaming service is best for live TV? 
FuboTV does the best job of letting you organize live channels to help you find just what you want to watch. The interface is uncluttered and when you search for something, the UI clearly tells you whether something is live now or on-demand. YouTube TV also does a good job making that info clear. Both have just over 100 live channels on offer. 
What is the most cost effective TV streaming service? 
Free TV streaming services like PlutoTV, Plex, Tubi and FreeVee show plenty of ad-supported TV shows and movies without charging you anything. Of course, they won’t have the same channels or content that more premium subscriptions have. Ultimately it depends on what you want to watch and finding the service that can supply that to you in the most streamlined form so you’re not paying for stuff you don’t need. 
Is it cheaper to have cable or streaming? 
A basic cable package used to be more expensive than the base-level live TV streaming service. But now that nearly all major providers have raised their prices to over $75 per month, that’s no longer the case. And with add-ons and other premiums, you can easily pay over $200 a month for either cable or a live TV streaming service. But those who want to cut the cord will appreciate that streaming services don&#39;t have contracts.  
What streaming service has all the TV channels? 
No service that we tested had every available channel. Hulu + Live TV and DirecTV Stream carry the the highest number of the top rated channels, according to Neilsen. Hulu’s service also gets you Disney+ fare, which you can’t get elsewhere. FuboTV has the most sports channels and YouTube TV gives you the widest selection of add-ons. 
What is the most popular live TV streaming platform? 
YouTube TV has the most paying customers. According to 2024&#39;s letter from the CEO, the service has over eight million subscribers. Disney’s 2024 third quarter earnings put the Hulu + Live TV viewer count at 4.6 million. Sling’s customer count dipped from two million to about 1.9 million in 2024 and FuboTV grew its subscriber list to 1.6 million. 
How safe are free streaming services and websites? 
You may have heard certain sites that provide free content can be dangerous, leading to stolen info and/or exposing you to malware. That’s likely in reference to certain peer-to-peer (P2P) networks and file-sharing sites that let people download free movies and series — which can come bundled with malicious code. 
But if you’re talking about the free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) services listed here, from providers like PlutoTV, Tubi and Plex, they are just as safe as any other streaming service. Since you sometimes don’t even have to provide your email address or credit card info, they can even be more anonymous for cord cutters than apps that require login credentials.

How to set up an iPad for a child,"Creating a child-friendly iPad takes a few extra steps, but Apple’s tools make the process relatively straightforward. From creating a child’s Apple ID to adjusting Screen Time and privacy settings, you can shape how your child uses the device and protect them from inappropriate content. The process varies slightly depending on whether the iPad is new or already in use, but the principles are the same: set up a managed account, connect it to Family Sharing and fine-tune the controls that keep your child’s digital space safe.
Create an Apple ID for your child
Every kid using an iPad should have their own Apple ID. This allows you to manage their account through Family Sharing and gives them access to features like iCloud, the App Store and Messages under your supervision. Apple requires parents to create accounts for children under 13, which can be done directly from your own device.
Open the Settings app on your iPhone or iPad, tap your name at the top and select Family. Tap Add Member, then Create Child Account, and follow the onscreen prompts. You’ll need to provide your child’s name and birth date, along with parental consent using your own Apple ID password. Once created, the account is automatically added to your Family Sharing group.
If your kid already has an account, you can invite them to join your Family Sharing setup instead. On the iPad, go to Settings &gt; Family &gt; Add Member, then select Invite People to send a request to their existing Apple ID email address. When they accept, you’ll be able to manage parental controls from your own device.
Add your child to Family Sharing
Family Sharing brings all your family’s Apple devices together under one umbrella. It lets you share subscriptions, purchases and iCloud storage, while giving you oversight of your child’s activity. The Ask to Buy feature, for example, requires your approval before your child can download apps or make in-app purchases, helping to avoid surprise charges.
To enable Family Sharing on your iPad, go to Settings &gt; [your name] &gt; Family, then tap Add Member if your child isn’t already added. You can manage shared purchases, location sharing and Screen Time settings from here. Linking devices through Family Sharing also makes it easier to locate a lost iPad and maintain consistent restrictions across all your family’s devices. For broader setup advice, see Engadget’s guide on how to set up a phone or tablet for a child.
Set up Screen Time and parental controls
Once your child’s account is linked, you can use Screen Time to manage how the iPad is used. Screen Time is found under Settings &gt; Screen Time, and it lets you set time limits, restrict certain apps, and monitor usage reports.
When first opening Screen Time on your child’s iPad, tap This is My Child’s iPad. You’ll be prompted to create a unique Screen Time passcode. This passcode is different from the iPad’s unlock code and prevents your child from changing settings without permission, so make sure you remember it. From here, you can configure several key features.
Downtime allows you to block all but essential apps and calls during certain hours, such as bedtime or homework time. App Limits sets daily time limits for categories such as games, entertainment or social networking. You can also set Communication Limits to control who your child can contact throughout the day and during Downtime, which is useful for if you only want them to message family members or trusted friends. The Always Allowed section lets you choose essential apps, such as Messages or educational tools, that remain accessible at all times.
You can adjust these settings from your own device if your child is part of your Family Sharing group. Screen Time reports provide detailed insight into how the iPad is used, so you can see which apps are used the most and make adjustments as needed.
Enable Content and Privacy Restrictions
Content and Privacy Restrictions offer finer control over what your kid can and cannot do with their iPad. To enable them, go to Settings &gt; Screen Time &gt; Content &amp; Privacy Restrictions, and toggle them on.
Within this menu, you can manage App Store purchases and downloads, disabling in-app purchases or preventing your child from installing or deleting apps. You can also filter explicit content in Apple Music, TV, and Books, and apply web restrictions in Safari to limit adult content. Under Web Content, choose Limit Adult Websites or specify certain sites that are allowed or blocked.
Privacy controls extend beyond content. You can manage location services, camera and microphone access and other sensitive permissions. For example, turning off location sharing in certain apps can help safeguard your child’s privacy. You can also prevent changes to accounts, passcodes and cellular settings, ensuring that restrictions remain consistent.
Fine-tune privacy and safety settings
Beyond Screen Time, Apple includes additional tools to make iPads safer for children. In Safari, you can enable SafeSearch to filter explicit results in search engines. Restrict AirDrop under Settings &gt; General &gt; AirDrop to limit sharing to Contacts Only or turn it off completely, reducing the potential for exposure to unsolicited files.
Messages includes a Communication Safety feature that uses on-device machine learning to detect sensitive images. When enabled, the iPad will blur images that contain nudity and offer guidance before the child can view them. You’ll find this under Settings &gt; Screen Time &gt; Communication Safety. It works entirely on the device and doesn’t send data to Apple, preserving privacy while offering extra protection.
If your child uses Game Center, you can limit multiplayer games, profile visibility and the ability to add friends. These small adjustments can prevent unwanted social interactions or exposure to inappropriate content in online games.
Use Guided Access for younger children
For younger children or toddlers, Guided Access can keep them focused on a single app and prevent them from accidentally navigating elsewhere. To enable it, open Settings &gt; Accessibility &gt; Guided Access, then toggle it on and set a passcode.
Once it’s active, open the app you want your child to use and triple-click the top button (or the Home button on older models). Guided Access locks the iPad to that app until you end the session with your passcode. You can disable hardware buttons or touch input areas to avoid navigating elsewhere in the app or accessing playback controls. This feature is ideal when you want your child to watch a video or use an educational app without interruption.
Keep everything up to date
After initial setup, it’s important to revisit these settings occasionally. Children’s needs change as they grow, and Apple regularly adds new parental features with each iPadOS update. Keep the iPad updated by going to Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update, and review restrictions periodically to ensure they still fit your child’s age and usage patterns.
Setting up an iPad for your child isn’t just about managing screen time or blocking certain apps. It’s about creating a space that encourages safe exploration while maintaining healthy boundaries. With Apple’s parental tools, you can find the right balance between freedom and supervision, making the iPad a secure and educational part of your child’s digital world.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/how-to-set-up-an-ipad-for-a-child-160001671.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-10%2F3d0b8b50-a50d-11f0-bfc5-c093aca2ed21&resize=1400%2C840&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=d558278c3aef7654a375222a7c52e9bffabbf784,https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/how-to-set-up-an-ipad-for-a-child-160001671.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-24T16:00:01Z,18,Tech

Pro-Russian hacker group claims responsibility for DDoS attack on French postal service,"A pro-Russian hacker group has come forward as the perpetrator of a DDoS attack on the French national postal service La Poste that took place on December 22, according to Reuters. The distributed denial-of-service attack took central computer systems at La Poste entirely offline and caused major disruptions in package deliveries just days before Christmas.
Reuters reported that the cyberattack on La Poste was still not fully resolved as of Wednesday morning. While regular letters were not affected, postal workers were unable to track packages and online payments through La Banque Postale, the service&#39;s banking division, were also disrupted.
The group, known as Noname057, has taken responsibility for or been accused of cyberattacks across the globe. Though attacks have occurred in over a dozen nations, the group has mostly targeted Ukraine as well as Ukraine-friendly nations.
Europol, the EU&#39;s law enforcement agency, launched an extensive operation against the group this summer. The US Justice Department has also been involved in actions against the hacker group.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/pro-russian-hacker-group-claims-responsibility-for-ddos-attack-on-french-postal-service-140015323.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-07%2Fc488e060-643e-11f0-afff-e34962257558&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=32e7096c0d32491cce3f16cb90b3f0442a135b7b,https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/pro-russian-hacker-group-claims-responsibility-for-ddos-attack-on-french-postal-service-140015323.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-24T14:00:15Z,7,Tech

Toyota's Prius Prime saved me gas money but probably not the environment,"I’ve always wondered what it would be like to own a plug-in hybrid, and recently, fate handed me that opportunity. On a recent trip to Vancouver, I rented a 2024 Toyota Prius Prime for nearly two months — the ideal scenario to try out North America’s most popular PHEV.
My experience with the Prius Prime
Previously, the words &#34;Prius&#34; and &#34;sexy&#34; were rarely used in the same sentence. However, I think the wedge-shaped Prius Prime introduced for 2023 is much sexier than its frumpy predecessors. The sleek shape also pierces the wind better to improve efficiency. It’s lower to the ground than before, though, which can make entry tough for taller or older people.
I was comfortable in the Prius Prime once seated, even though the materials and options aren’t quite as luxurious as other PHEVs sold in the US. On two 10-hour highway drives up to northern Canada I never felt sore (or cold) in the well-bolstered, heated seats. However, visibility wasn’t the greatest due to the low seating position and thick front pillars that occasionally blocked my view of traffic.
Steve Dent for Engadget
With its wraparound dash and 8-inch touchscreen, the interior is reasonably high-tech but not to the standard of some EVs I’ve tried recently. It came with wireless CarPlay and Android Auto support that gave me seamless streaming entertainment on long highway stretches. The driver safety features (lanekeeping, adaptive cruise, automatic braking and more) also boosted my confidence in Vancouver’s gnarly traffic. The Prius Prime doesn’t offer true one-pedal implementation, but it has a mode that’s close to that.
With a two-liter 150 HP gas motor and 161 HP electric motor (net 220 HP combined), the 2024 (fifth generation) Prius Prime has a whopping 100 more horsepower than the previous model. The electric drivetrain is supplied by a 13.6kWh battery (10.9kWH usable) that takes four hours to charge at 240 volts, or double that with 120-volt household electricity. That means you can juice it fully overnight, but it doesn’t have DC fast-charging for speedy power-ups on longer trips. The EPA electric range is 44 miles, 19 more than the fourth-gen Prius.
It accelerated surprisingly well (from 0 to 60mph in 6.7 seconds) and was agile, but had a fair amount of body roll since it’s not designed for the race track. Still, considering the Prius’s reputation as a staid hippie econobox, the new model was downright sporty. I enjoyed driving in the all-electric mode much more than the hybrid mode, though — it was quieter and smoother, with lower noise levels and vibration.
So, how far was I able to drive on that electric motor alone? On the highway at about 65 MPH, I eked out 30 miles and just over 40 miles in the city. On one trip, I drove from the city center to a suburb 30 miles away and made it there and partially back on a full charge. On another voyage, I was able to drive back and forth between the east- and west-most points of Vancouver (13 miles) — a typical commute for many city-dwellers — with about a quarter charge to spare.
Steve Dent for Engadget
With consistent charging, my fuel consumption over a two week period (averaging 25 miles per day) was about a quarter of a tank or around $7.50. In terms of electricity, I used nearly 70.5kWh during that time at $.085/kWh, for a total of $6. All told, I spent $13.50 for gas and electricity over 350 miles of mixed driving, so the Prius Prime was clearly cheap to operate.
For longer trips, it’s still as inexpensive as it gets for a gasoline-powered vehicle, thanks to the efficient ICE motor and hybrid system that’s among the best in the industry. With a full battery charge and tank, I set out on a 547-mile drive and travelled 470 miles before stopping for gas, with a quarter tank to spare. That fill-up cost around $25.
The true savings and the problem with plug-in hybrids
The timing for my test of this car was ideal. In October, I spotted a European study concluding that PHEVs aren’t as economical as expected over a large sample size. Engadget’s article about that stirred up some passion among owners and potential buyers, so I wanted to compare my experience with points in the study.
First, let’s see if a PHEV is worth the extra money compared to a regular hybrid. My calculations are for the average US buyer and don’t take state or federal clean air rebates into account.
When I chose to rent a &#34;compact&#34; car, Avis assigned me a mid-range Prius Prime XSE — a model that lists at $37,320 but typically sells for $34,590, according to Edmunds. That suited me well as it only lacked a few features of the high-end XSE Premium, notably the larger 13.2-inch infotainment display and solar roof option. A fully equipped 2026 XSE Premium model with those features costs $41,665.
Steve Dent for Engadget
Since Toyota also makes a regular hybrid Prius, that vehicle offers an ideal comparison. The equivalent Prius XTE model has a list price of $31,995 in a similar configuration, making it $5,325 cheaper than the Prius Prime XSE.
The average US driver covers 13,662 miles per year and gasoline currently has a median $3 per gallon price. Over that distance, a non-PHEV Prius driver could expect to burn 273 gallons at 50 MPG (EPA combined) in a year, spending $819 on fuel.
A Prius Prime driver, on the other hand, would use 70 to 85 percent less fuel by current EPA or WLPT estimates. If we generously take the high end of those numbers at 85 percent, that cuts fuel costs to $160. That would require using about 2,500 kWh of electricity, though, so at an average US price of $0.18/kWh, that amounts to $450, for a total of $610 (gas plus electricity). That means you’d save just $209 in a year, or $2,090.00 over 10 years — not enough to justify the extra price. (Fuel and electricity prices, usage and other factors vary by region and can have a big impact on those figures.)
It could be even worse than that, according to a European automotive thinktank called Transport &amp; Environment (T&amp;E). After gathering real-world OBFCM data from 800,000 vehicles, they determined that PHEVs only run in all-electric mode 27 percent of the time, rather than 84 percent as estimated by Europe’s WLPT standard. As a result, plug-in hybrids in Europe emit five times more emissions and cost users €500 ($586) more per year than previously thought. Those figures are likely similar in the US.
Steve Dent for Engadget
How could regulators be so wrong about this key data? The first, obvious reason is that they underestimated how often people charge their vehicles. With their relatively short range, plug-in hybrids often need a full charge to get through the day in electric-only mode — but many people aren’t doing that.
Why? One reason may be a lack of easy charger access away from home. I found them to be difficult to find and use, often requiring a sign-up or app rather than just letting me tap a credit card (I’m looking at you, ChargePoint, Flo and Switch Energy). It can also be more expensive than just buying gasoline, since many companies charge triple or more the market rate for electricity. Another factor is that drivers of company or fleet PHEVs charge their vehicles less often than private owners.
There&#39;s one additional and especially pernicious reason: The ICE engine often kicks in when PHEVs are supposedly running in all-electric mode, particularly with heavier sedans or SUVs. That’s because the electric motors alone aren’t powerful enough for maneuvers like passing.
Larger batteries can boost all-electric usage, but only to a point. Beyond 45 miles of range, emissions actually increase. The reason is simple: &#34;Long-range PHEVs are the heaviest in the dataset, averaging 28 percent more mass and 33 percent more engine power than the group just below,&#34; T&amp;E wrote.
Steve Dent for Engadget
Overall, I enjoyed my time with the Prius Prime and found it to be fun, practical and cheap to drive. It’s the most economical PHEV because it has excellent electric range and enough power that the ICE engine rarely needs to kick in. At the same time, it offers the highest EPA mileage rating of any non-EV sold in North America. If I were in the market for a new vehicle, the Prius Prime would be high on my list.
However, I also learned that PHEVs aren’t reducing emissions or saving buyers as much as regulators and manufacturers have promised. Governments are to blame for much of that, as they overestimated all-electric use in PHEVs and failed to support the charging infrastructure needed to make them practical.
Responsibility also falls to automakers and buyers. Consumers want SUVs, but manufacturers aren’t making the electric motors in PHEVs powerful enough to run all the time in EV mode or offering fast DC charging. At the same time, drivers are failing to charge their vehicles consistently. Until those issues are solved, in my experience plug-in hybrids are a poor substitute for EVs in terms of emissions and a less economical choice than regular hybrids.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/toyotas-prius-prime-saved-me-gas-money-but-probably-not-the-environment-133027378.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2Fc4143db0-e0a2-11f0-b345-4c9156df154f&resize=1400%2C870&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=5360ce15d63df53c497aeb706f9ffa22af2c43c7,https://www.engadget.com/transportation/toyotas-prius-prime-saved-me-gas-money-but-probably-not-the-environment-133027378.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-24T13:30:27Z,7,Tech

How to redeem game codes on the Nintendo Switch 2,"Digital game codes remain one of the simplest ways to add new titles to a Nintendo library. The Nintendo Switch 2 handles code redemption in a familiar way, building on the same process used on the original Switch. You can redeem a download code directly from the eShop on the console, or through a browser on a phone or desktop. Both routes link the purchase to the same Nintendo Account so the redeemed title appears on any compatible device tied to that account. The process is quick once you know where to look. Here is how to redeem game codes on Switch 2 through the console and online.
Things to know before you start
A Nintendo Account is required and the Switch 2 must be connected to the internet for on-device redemption. Most codes contain sixteen characters made up of letters and numbers. The characters are displayed on a physical card, on a receipt or in a confirmation email from a retailer. The characters should be entered exactly as supplied. Each code can only be redeemed once and becomes linked to the Nintendo Account used during the process.
How to redeem a game code on the Switch 2 via the eShop
Redeeming a code through the Switch 2 itself is the most direct approach because the download begins as soon as the code is accepted.
Start on the Switch 2 home screen and open the Nintendo eShop icon. The console will prompt you to choose the user profile that should receive the content. Each user profile has a separate eShop purchase history, so pick the correct one before moving on.
Once the eShop loads, look for the Redeem Code option in the main menu. On the Switch 2, this appears in the left navigation panel alongside the store’s standard browsing categories. Select Redeem Code to open a screen with an input field and the on-screen keyboard.
Enter the sixteen-character code carefully. Codes may contain similar-looking characters particularly when numbers and letters appear in the same sequence. After entering the full set of characters select OK to move forward. The system checks the code and shows a confirmation page with the game or content tied to it.
If the code is valid, select Redeem to finish the process. The game will appear on the home screen as soon as the redemption is complete. A progress bar shows the download status until the installation finishes. If the game includes a Switch and Switch 2 version, the system will prompt you to choose which version to download.
If the game does not begin downloading head to the All Software view or the Download Management screen to confirm the status. The redeemed title should be visible with either a queued or active download.
How to redeem a Switch 2 code online
Nintendo also supports online redemption through its digital store, which is useful if you are away from the console or prefer to type the code on a full keyboard. The redeemed title will still appear in your account’s purchase history and can be downloaded later from the Switch 2.
Open a browser on a phone, tablet or computer and go to the Nintendo Account login page. Sign in using the account linked to your Switch 2. Once logged in navigate to the code redemption page for the Nintendo eShop. This page contains a text box where you can paste or type the code.
Enter the code exactly as provided and select Next. A confirmation screen appears with the game details. Select Redeem to finalize the action. The content is now tied to your account and ready to download on your console.
If the console is in sleep mode and has auto downloads enabled, the game may start downloading immediately. Otherwise open the eShop on the Switch 2 later and check the Download Management section for your queued title.
What to expect after redeeming a code
Every redeemed game becomes part of your Nintendo Account’s digital library. This applies across devices tied to the same account, which means that games purchased on a Switch or a browser will still appear when you sign in on a Switch 2. If the game supports cloud backup through Nintendo Switch Online, save data will sync once the game is installed.
Some games offer separate versions for the original Switch and Switch 2. When this applies, you’ll be asked to pick which version you want to download. The choice does not usually affect your ownership but it determines which software build is installed on the device.
If a code fails, Nintendo advises checking that the characters are entered correctly and confirming that you are using a download code rather than a control number, which often appears on the same card. Codes for DLC downloads require the base game on the destination console. Region restrictions also apply so the code must match the region of your Nintendo Account’s eShop.
Why Switch 2 uses the same redemption system as the original Switch
The Switch 2 keeps the familiar eShop structure that users have relied on since the original console. Keeping this process consistent simplifies the transition for families with multiple consoles and reduces the friction of carrying existing purchases forward. Nintendo Accounts continue to serve as the backbone for digital ownership which makes it easy to claim a code on one device and access the game on another.
The updated interface on the Switch 2 adds clarity to navigation but code redemption still works the same way on both platforms. This continuity ensures that retailers can distribute standard sixteen-character download codes and users can rely on simple steps to activate them.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/how-to-redeem-game-codes-on-the-nintendo-switch-2-130059847.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-06%2F0a096060-55df-11f0-ba9d-0a6ff3cbbb07&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=bafc419ede38e1ffcd99dcb962746592be6cbfea,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/how-to-redeem-game-codes-on-the-nintendo-switch-2-130059847.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-24T13:00:59Z,12,Tech

Samsung's latest Odyssey gaming monitor has a 32-inch 6K screen with glasses-free 3D,"Ahead of CES 2026, Samsung has unveiled a number of impressive gaming monitors that flaunt 3D and very high refresh rates. The headliner is the 32-inch Odyssey 3D, &#34;the world&#39;s first 6K display with glasses free 3D,&#34; according to Samsung. Along with the high resolution, it offers a 165Hz refresh rate (boosted to 330Hz through Dual Mode), along with a 1ms GtG response time. Optimized 3D effects that enhance terrain, distance and object separation &#34;beyond 2D&#34; will work with featured games like Stellar Blade and The First Berserker: Khazan,&#34; according to Samsung.
Another model, the 27-inch Odyssey G6, brings refresh rates to a new level. It&#39;s the world&#39;s first 1,040 Hz monitor through Dual Mode and offers native QHD support up to 600Hz &#34;to help players track targets and see fine details during high-speed movement,&#34; Samsung claims. It can provide instant performance boosts and is AMD FreeSync and NVIDIA G-Sync compatible. 
Samsung
If it&#39;s OLED you want, Samsung has that covered as well with the 32-inch Odyssey OLED G8. It pairs a 4K QD-OLED panel with a 240Hz refresh rate, while offering glare-free viewing and VESA DisplayHDR True Black 500 certification, though brightness is limited to 300 nits. It&#39;s DisplayPort 2.1 and HDMI 2.1 compatible with up to 80Gbps bandwidth, while supporting both AMD FreeSync Premium Pro and NVIDIA G-Sync. 
Finally, Samsung introduced two other new high-resolution Odyssey G8 models as well. The first is the 32-inch G80HS model with 6K resolution at up to 165Hz and the other  is the 5K, 27-inch Odyssey G8 with native support up to 180Hz and Dual Mode boosting that to 360Hz in QHD. There&#39;s no word on pricing yet for any of these models, but we&#39;ll likely learn that early next year.

US bans former EU Commissioner and others over social media rules,"The Trump administration has issued travel bans that prohibit five European tech researchers, including one former EU Commissioner, from entering the United States. “For far too long, ideologues in Europe have led organized efforts to coerce American platforms to punish American viewpoints they oppose. The Trump Administration will no longer tolerate these egregious acts of extraterritorial censorship,” said US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.That official is Thierry Breton, the former European Commissioner for Internal Markets and Digital Services, who Sarah Rogers called the “mastermind” of the Digital Services Act. Rogers, the Under Secretary of State, said Breton threatened Elon Musk about ongoing formal proceedings for X’s noncompliance with “illegal content” and “disinformation” under the DSA just before his meeting with President Trump. The administration has also banned Imran Ahmed from the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), who apparently called for American anti-vaxxers to be deplatformed. One of those people is Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who’s now the US Secretary of Health.Clare Melford from the UK-based Global Disinformation Index has also been banned. Her group monitors online platforms for hate speech. Anna-Lena von Hodenberg and Josephine Ballon from German organization HateAid, have been banned, as well. HateAid flags hate speech online for the EU under DSA rules.As The New York Times notes, these travel bans emphasize the administration’s close relationship with internet and tech companies, which would benefit from having DSA rules loosened or abolished. The Global Disinformation Index called the travel bans “an authoritarian attack on free speech and an egregious act of government censorship.” Meanwhile, von Hodenberg and Ballon said the bans mark a new escalation. “The US government is clearly questioning European sovereignty,” they said. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/us-bans-former-eu-commissioner-and-others-over-social-media-rules-121804097.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-10%2F7bb64670-a818-11f0-bf7f-0cfcec9ec778&resize=1400%2C971&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=19504e8dd74466c51eb75d38cfe9b1e6f50112ac,https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/us-bans-former-eu-commissioner-and-others-over-social-media-rules-121804097.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-24T12:18:04Z,7,Tech

Webrat turns GitHub PoCs into a malware trap,"
		
					  
						




Security professionals hunting PoCs and exploit code on GitHub might soon walk into a trap, as attackers redirect a known RAT toward them.



Researchers have uncovered a stealthy campaign in which the Webrat Trojan, known for months to hide inside game cheats and cracked software, is now posing as proof-of-concept exploit repositories on GitHub to trick unsuspecting security researchers.



The clever decoy and the unexpected target set the campaign apart from typical malware distribution attacks.



Kaspersky’s security analysts spotted this evolution where attackers uploaded seemingly legitimate vulnerability exploit code, complete with structured documentation, only to lure targets into downloading a backdoor.



From Game cheats to GitHub exploits



Webrat isn’t new. It has a history of hiding in plain sight under familiar lures like game cheat packages (including Rust, Counter-Strike, and Roblox) and cracked software installers. But in the latest campaign, dating back to at least as far as September 2025,  attackers started to change their approach by hosting repositories on GitHub that appear to offer exploit code for high-profile vulnerabilities with high CVSSv3 scores.



The vulnerabilities they pushed exploits for included a critical heap-based buffer overflow in Internet Explorer (CVE-2025-59295/ CVSS 8.8), a max severity authentication bypass in a WordPress plugin (CVE-2025-10294/ CVSS 9.8), and an improper access control in Windows Remote Access Connection Manager (CVE-2025-59230/ CVSS 7.8).



Apart from dumping the exploit code, the repositories included detailed sections with overviews of the vulnerability, system impact, install guides, usage steps, and even mitigation advice. The consistency of the format to a professional PoC writeup suggests the descriptions are machine-generated to avoid detection by seasoned professionals, Kaspersky researchers noted in a blog post.



The malicious payload and behavior



Beneath the polished README, the attackers dumped a password-protected ZIP linked in the repository. The archive password was hidden in file names, something easily missable by unsuspecting eyes. Inside, the key components include a decoy DLL, a batch file to launch the malware, and the primary executable (like rasmanesc.exe) capable of escalating privileges, disabling Windows Defender, and retrieving the real Webrat payload from hardcoded command-and-control (c2) servers.



Once executed, Webrat installs a backdoor on the host system. The backdoor can exfiltrate credentials, access cryptocurrency wallets, spy through webcams and microphones, log keystrokes, and steal data from messaging apps like Telegram, Discord, and gaming platforms such as Steam.



The capabilities amount to a full-blown surveillance and theft platform under the attacker’s control.



Significance of the shift



Researchers found the shift from tricking casual users with game cheats to targeting tech professionals with exploit code as notable as well as concerning. “They are targeting researchers who frequently rely on open sources to find and analyze code related to new vulnerabilities,” they said.



However, experienced security researchers typically analyze such exploits within isolated environments like virtual machines or sandboxes, minimizing risk. Which is perhaps why the campaign is seen as deliberately tuned to target novices, including students, junior analysts, and those eager to explore PoCs without safe handling practices.



“Cybersecurity professionals, especially inexperienced researchers and students, must remain vigilant when handling exploits and any potentially malicious files,” the researchers advised. “To prevent potential damage to work and personal devices containing sensitive information, we recommend analyzing these exploits and files within isolated environments like virtual machines or sandboxes.” The disclosure noted that Webrat itself hasn’t undergone any significant technical changes. Instead, attackers have reframed the risk by turning open-source curiosity into an attack surface.

Implementing NIS2 — without getting bogged down in red tape,"
		
					  
						




NIS2 is symbolic of the core problem with European directives and regulations: They generate unnecessary red tape and too rarely have the desired effect.



Whether it’s the Supply Chain Act, GDPR impact assessments, or the IT Security Act — the common theme is that companies have to produce mountains of documentation, something that neither increases actual security nor is realistically verifiable.



A compliant entity is typically one that can provide comprehensive documentation of all processes and regular audits. This documentation is usually so detailed that its creation already entails an almost unreasonable effort, and manual review becomes practically impossible. Even if it were reviewed, the information would not be precise enough to demonstrate genuine security.



Security should be included in the planning



This leads to an absurd practice at many companies: The technical team builds functioning infrastructure, and separately, a compliance officer subsequently writes a lengthy justification as to why the solution is supposedly secure.



That’s roughly equivalent to Volkswagen building a car and only afterwards someone writing 40 pages about why that car should meet safety standards. In real-world industry, of course, things work differently: Safety requirements are already integrated into the planning, minimum technological standards are defined, and quality processes automatically monitor implementation. Compliance results from technology — not from ring binders.



In other areas, such as tax audits, this problem has long been recognized, and the automation of relevant processes is legally mandated (keyword: electronic cash register, audit-proof accounting software). This not only saves honest business owners enormous amounts of manual work but, above all, reduces the risk of fraud.



Unfortunately, few things are implemented as consistently in Germany as the collection of our taxes.



Unlike the issue of tax burden, companies should have an intrinsic interest in correctly implementing their IT security. The fine for a NIS2 violation can amount to up to €10 million or 2% of global annual revenue. The economic damage caused by successful cyberattacks is often existential and already amounts to hundreds of billions of euros per year.



Even though it is not explicitly required by law, it is now possible — not least thanks to AI-supported tools — to automate security processes and their complete documentation to such an extent that security, compliance, and auditability can be combined in a single technical process. This not only saves resources but also increases actual security.



An example of a SaaS application in the cloud shows what this can look like in detail.



IT in transition: From text documents to declarative technology



NIS2 essentially requires three things: concrete security measures; processes and guidelines for managing these measures; and robust evidence that they work in practice.



Process documentation — that is, policies, responsibilities, and procedures — is not fundamentally new for most larger companies. ISO 27001-based information security management systems, HR processes, and management manuals have often been in place for years. Therefore, two levels are crucial for NIS2: the technical measures and the evidence that they are effective.



This is precisely where the transformation of recent years becomes apparent. Previously, concepts, measures, and specifications for software and IT infrastructures were predominantly documented in text form. Program code was too complex, and configurations were scattered across files, ticketing systems, or in the minds of individual administrators. Documents were then written afterward — often by colleagues from other disciplines. This approach was problematic for two main reasons: It doesn’t scale in growing, distributed environments, and it doesn’t align with the goal of consistently automating technical processes.



Modern systems therefore rely on methods such as test-driven or behavior-driven development and infrastructure as code (IaC), which — when consistently applied — largely replace text documentation. The technical specifications required by NIS2 can directly reference these artifacts: IaC definitions define encryption, network segments, or backup scenarios, and CI/CD pipelines deploy them to production in an audit-proof manner.



Changes are thus not only described with technical precision, but also traceable chronologically via commits and deployments. Evidence for aspects that cannot be fully declared — such as the security of the software supply chain or the application code — can be mapped via security checks in the CI/CD pipeline and ongoing evaluation by SIEM and CNAPP systems.



The following areas provide a particularly clear example of what this can look like in practice:




Identity and access management



Vulnerability management in the software supply chain and in monitoring



Incident handling



Reporting obligations




Identity and access Management: Policies as code instead of Excel roles



Identity and access management is one of the central pillars of NIS2. What’s required is not just “any” roles, but an access concept based on Need-to-Know, Least Privilege, and Separation of Duties. In practice, this can be effectively conceived in three levels: the deliberate granting of rights, a realistic lifecycle for these rights, and an architecture that prevents lateral movement as much as possible.



Instead of managing permissions in Excel, admin UIs, and scattered wikis, roles and access rights are defined as “policies as code” or IaC — for example, as Terraform modules or JSON/YAML policies in a Git repository. All changes are made exclusively via merge requests and deployed through a CI/CD pipeline.



This makes it clearly traceable who changed which permissions, who approved the change, and when it went live. The documentation and accountability requirements of NIS2 thus arise directly from Git history and pipeline logs, without anyone having to write additional Word documents.



A role model alone does not guarantee the principle of least privilege. NIS2 requires that rights be regularly reviewed and unnecessary permissions removed. In cloud environments with hundreds of accounts, services, pods, and functions, this is virtually impossible to manage manually.



This is where cloud identity entitlement management (CIEM) systems come in. They read all effective permissions from the environment, correlate them with audit logs, and show which rights are actually being used and where overprivileging exists. This is particularly crucial for non-human identities (service accounts, workloads), because this is precisely where very broad rights are often granted, which can later serve as a springboard for attackers.



Some startups now even offer CIEM systems that can automatically generate IAM policies for the relevant roles using AI.



Vulnerability management and software supply chain: SBOM instead of scanner PDF



The second area that NIS2 and the new Implementing Regulation 2024/2690 for digital services are enshrining in law is vulnerability management in the company’s own code and supply chain. This requires regular vulnerability scans, procedures for assessment and prioritization, timely remediation of critical vulnerabilities, and regulated vulnerability handling and — where necessary — coordinated vulnerability disclosure. Cloud and SaaS providers also face additional supply chain obligations, for example, towards cloud, CI/CD, and registry service providers.



In traditional vulnerability management, SCA, SAST, and DAST scanners are simply “dragged across everything.” The result is endless lists of findings, most of which are false positives or irrelevant to the specific system. This data then ends up in Excel spreadsheets or a vulnerability database, where teams try to prioritize. Especially with zero-day vulnerabilities, this leads to frantic ad-hoc analyses: Which of our components are affected? Is the vulnerability even exploitable in our architecture? What do we do until a patch is available?



The modern approach is to consolidate all DevSecOps findings in a central system. Results from SCA, SAST, and DAST are combined there, enriched with context from the software bill of materials (SBOM), architecture, and exposure, and pre-filtered using AI. This drastically reduces false positives, leaving a significantly smaller set of truly relevant vulnerabilities, including an assessment of their criticality in the specific setup.



These consolidated findings can be directly forwarded to ticketing systems and the SOC, where they are treated like incidents, tracked, and evaluated for NIS2 reports. This transforms a proliferating scanner output into a manageable process that reflects both legal requirements and operational realities.



Monitoring, incident handling, and reporting center



The third area where NIS2 quickly becomes a paper tiger is the combination of monitoring, incident response, and the new reporting requirements. The directive sets clear deadlines: early warning within 24 hours, a structured report after 72 hours, and a final report no later than one month. Many organizations are reacting by creating new templates, Excel spreadsheets, and reporting manuals — often largely detached from their existing SOC.



In a critical situation, this means that the SOC tackles the incident while, simultaneously, an “NIS2 task force” tries to process information from tickets, emails, and ad-hoc chats so that it fits into a form. The result is duplicated work, loss of information, and reports that fill pages but reveal little about how well detection and response actually work.



In a cloud SaaS environment, a different approach is possible: Instead of treating NIS2 reporting as a separate document project, a modern DevSecOps-based SOC is built, so that all security-relevant signals converge in one place from the outset: cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, applications, IdP, and IAM.



The rules governing how this data is correlated, enriched, and transformed into incidents are defined and versioned as code. Threat detection and response logic, thresholds, and playbooks reside in the repository and are deployed via pipelines, just like application code. This allows for the automation of large portions of traditional SOC work: Raw logs are transformed into consistent, contextualized incidents without requiring manual copying and pasting of text snippets. 



Cloud-native application protection platforms (CNAPP) and similar platforms simultaneously handle data storage and archiving, ensuring that the evidence of monitoring activity is generated within the system rather than through separate documentation loops. Machine learning and AI components further assist in reducing false positives, clustering similar events, and highlighting unusual patterns — allowing the SOC to focus on the few incidents that truly require attention.



At the process level, playbooks and reporting channels remain important — but streamlined. An incident response playbook defines incident classes, escalation paths, and communication rules, including the criteria for when an incident is considered “NIS2 significant.” A reporting process governs who consolidates the information from the SOC and business units and submits it via the BSI reporting center.



The actual documentation is also generated largely automatically here: Incident tickets contain a timeline, affected services, impact, cause, and measures; a “NIS2-relevant” indicator and a reporting status link them to external reports. Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as MTTD, MTTR, or the time between detection and initial reporting can be calculated directly from SIEM and IR data — precisely the metrics that reveal whether NIS2 is a lived process or just another drawer in the document cabinet.



NIS2 as an architecture test, not just a documentation exercise



NIS2 forces companies to explicitly define their security measures, processes, and documentation. This is inconvenient — ​​especially for organizations that have previously operated largely on an ad-hoc basis. Whether this becomes a mere formality or a genuine security improvement, however, depends not on the legal text, but on the architecture.



Anyone attempting to simply “document away” the policy using Word, PowerPoint, and Excel will generate a lot of effort and little resilience. However, if IdP and IAM, CI/CD pipelines, SBOM and vulnerability tools, SIEM, and IR platforms are configured to provide the required controls and evidence almost incidentally, NIS2 compliance is achieved as a side effect of a modern security landscape.

ServiceNow’s $7.75 billion cash deal for Armis illustrates shifting strategies,"
		
					  
						




ServiceNow on Tuesday announced that it would buy cybersecurity vendor Armis for $7.75 billion in cash.  This builds on its December purchase of identity security vendor Vezas, and the closing of its acquisition of AI vendor Moveworks.



Analysts and cybersecurity practitioners mostly applauded the move, but cautioned that this could force CIOs and CISOs away from a best-of-breed strategy and into a classic suite approach, where the individual elements may be merely good enough.



“This is an extension of what we have been seeing at the ERP application layer,” said Scott Bickley, an advisory fellow at the Info-Tech Research Group. “ServiceNow is basically saying ‘We don’t want to be a point solution. We want to be the platform by which you coordinate and solve all of your problems.’”



Bickley noted that this trend has been ongoing for a few years, with many of the largest vendors trying to offer suites that deliver everything. “Microsoft was the initial poster child of this,” he said. “They are going to start to embed [AI and cybersecurity] capabilities into their suites and bundles, where you don’t necessarily have an opt-out solution. You will get ‘maybe good enough’ versus best of breed.”



But looking at ServiceNow’s two other recent acquisitions, Vezas and Moveworks, could suggest parallel strategies. “ServiceNow has hedged their bets without saying that they are hedging their bets,” Bickley said. 



Pablo Stern, EVP and general manager of tech workflow products at ServiceNow, confirmed in an interview that the Armis acquisition is the largest in ServiceNow’s history. He added that the companies have been partnering “for well more than two years.”



ServiceNow’s statement about the Armis deal described the two firms as creating “a unified, end-to-end security exposure and operations stack that can see, decide, and act across the entire technology footprint.” It said that it expects to fund the transaction through a combination of cash on hand and debt. The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2026, subject, as always, to regulatory approvals and closing conditions.



Pressure from Agentic AI



The statement quoted ServiceNow COO Amit Zavery suggesting that agentic developments are a key part of the strategy.



“In the agentic AI era, intelligent trust and governance that span any cloud, any asset, any AI system, and any device are non-negotiable if companies want to scale AI for the long-term,” Zavery said in the announcement. “Together with Armis, we will deliver an industry-defining strategic cybersecurity shield for real-time, end-to-end proactive protection across all technology estates. Modern cyber risk doesn’t stay neatly confined to a single silo, and with security built into the ServiceNow AI Platform, neither will we.”



The soaring popularity of autonomous agents that figure out on their own how to perform various tasks has concerned many cybersecurity executives, as the risk of security holes created by enterprise agentic trials is becoming clear. 



Most cybersecurity practitioners saw the move as the latest indicator that CIOs and CISOs must rethink how they do their jobs, given how AI is forcing changes in data management and data leakage. 



Visibility is the key



“For decades, the CIO’s white whale has been a precise, real-time Configuration Management Database [CMDB]. Most are outdated the moment they are populated,” said Whisper Security CEO Kaveh Ranjbar. The Armis acquisition “is an admission that in an era of IoT, OT, and edge computing, you cannot rely on manual entry or standard agents anymore. The system of action needs to own the system of record for the unmanaged world. For CIOs, this signals that automated, continuous discovery is now the only acceptable standard for IT asset management. You can’t automate workflows on assets you don’t know exist.”



The lesson, Ranjbar said, is different for the CISO. “CISOs have historically suffered from the swivel-chair problem: one screen shows the vulnerability and another screen is needed to patch it. This deal collapses that gap. It validates that visibility is the new perimeter. As OT and IT converge, the attack surface has become too complex for fragmented tools. CISOs should view this as a mandate to consolidate their visibility stacks.”



Sanchit Vir Gogia, the chief analyst at Greyhound Research, agreed that this acquisition will likely accelerate IT and security structural changes. 



“This acquisition represents a fundamental repositioning of ServiceNow from a coordination layer into an operational authority. Buying Armis is not about expanding a security portfolio. It is about owning the upstream constraint that determines whether modern enterprises can govern complexity at all,” Gogia said. But without knowing what is connected across IT, OT, IoT, and other physical environments, “workflow automation, AI governance, and risk prioritization all collapse into theatre,” he observed, adding that the deal could remove long standing fragmentation between discovery tools, CMDBs, service mapping, ticketing, change management, and remediation. “If executed well, it could finally address one of the enterprise’s most persistent failures,” he said.



Gogia added, “continuous discovery tied to business context has the potential to turn the CMDB from a negotiated artefact into a living system. That would change how incidents are resolved, how changes are governed, how audits are passed, and how accountability is assigned.”



Reveals architectural debt



Given that the deal is not expected to be closed until next summer, executives should temper their timeline expectations.



The 2026 second half closing date “implies a prolonged transition period where integration depth, roadmap clarity, and packaging decisions will evolve. CIOs should plan for ambiguity, not assume instant unification. Early value will come from visibility, [therefore] full platform value will take time,” Gogia said. 



Another consultant, Yvette Schmitter, CEO of the Fusion Collective consulting firm, said the deal is sitting atop years of bad enterprise IT strategy.



“This acquisition exposes more than ServiceNow’s strategy. It reveals the architectural debt hiding in every enterprise security stack that CIOs have been promising to address ‘next quarter’ for the past three years,” Schmitter said. “ServiceNow just signaled that platform plays will dominate over point solutions, and they’re willing to fund it with debt to move quickly while enterprises are still running budget committee meetings about tool sprawl.”



She observed, “the valuation for Armis tells you the market assigns premium multiples to cyber-physical capabilities spanning IT, OT, and medical devices. Translation: that patchwork of legacy security tools you’ve been defending as ‘best of breed’ just became technical debt you can’t explain to the board. CIOs need to audit their current security tool sprawl and map total cost of ownership before vendors make that case for them with renewal pricing that reflects your lack of alternatives.”



The question, she said, “is no longer whether to consolidate, but whether your organization controls the timing and terms of that consolidation.”



Cybersecurity consultant Brian Levine, a former federal prosecutor who today serves as executive director of FormerGov, said that Armis executives were evaluating going public before they decided to accept the ServiceNow offer.



“For Armis, skipping the IPO and joining ServiceNow is a signal that the market for standalone device‑security platforms is consolidating fast, and scale wins,” Levine said. “The line between workflow, risk, and security is disappearing, and ServiceNow wants to own the convergence point.” 



Aaron Painter, CEO of authentication vendor Nametag, added that part of the IT confusion is that product names no longer mean what they once meant. 



“Many of the workflows ServiceNow already automates are now security workflows, even if they’re still labeled as operations. Onboarding and offboarding, incident response, asset exceptions, vendor access, and change management all involve decisions that directly shape security outcomes,” Painter said. “Looked at alongside ServiceNow’s earlier acquisition of Veza, the strategy becomes clearer: ServiceNow is trying to connect asset visibility with identity and access intelligence, so the platform understands not just what devices exist, but who has access, why they have it, and whether that trust still makes sense over time.”

Interpol sweep takes down cybercrooks in 19 countries,"
		
					  
						




A ransomware expert lauded a recent crackdown on cybercrooks in Africa that resulted in the decryption of six ransomware strains, smashing of links to malicious websites, and hundreds of arrests as major action.



“This may not be the same headline as taking down LockBit, but I think it is significant,” said Jon DiMaggio, chief security strategist, Analyst1 and co-author of an upcoming book on chasing ransomware gangs. “Because law enforcement can’t arrest Russian ransomware criminals, it’s smart to focus on areas of the world where we can make a difference and get people.”



He was commenting on the statement today by Interpol that in Operation Sentinel, which ran between October 27 and November 27 of this year, law enforcement agencies in 19 African countries arrested 574 suspects, decrypted six ransomware variants, took down 6,000 malicious links, cracked a business email compromise scam that almost cost a major petroleum company $7.9 million, and recovered approximately $3 million.



Interpol didn’t identify the ransomware strains that were decrypted. DiMaggio suspects they were modified variants of strains available on dark web sites.



Important to disrupt gangs before they expand



In describing the operation, Interpol cited efforts in multiple countries. In Ghana, it said that an unnamed financial institution, which saw 100TB of its data encrypted, was one of the victims. Ghanaian authorities conducted advanced malware analysis that led to the creation of a decryption tool and the recovery of nearly 30TB of the data.



Ghanaian authorities also dismantled a major cyber-fraud network operating across Ghana and Nigeria that defrauded more than 200 victims of over $400,000. Using professionally designed websites and mobile apps, the scammers mimicked well-known fast-food brands, collecting payments but never delivering orders. Ten suspects were arrested in Ghana, and over 100 digital devices seized and 30 fraudulent servers taken offline. 



In Benin, 43 malicious domains were taken down, and 4,318 social media accounts linked to extortion schemes and scams were shut down, leading to 106 arrests. And in Cameroon, law enforcement reacted quickly after two victims reported a scam involving an online vehicle sales platform. The phishing campaign was traced to a compromised server, and an emergency bank freeze was issued within hours.



A ‘very good thing’



The fact that the same operation broke ransomware operations and a business email compromise (BEC) operation is “unique,” said DiMaggio, because most people think of Africa as the source of BEC and fraud scams.



The fact that authorities are working to disrupt ransomware operations in Africa before they grow to the size of those run by gangs in other areas of the world “is a very good thing,” he said. Africa is “a few steps behind where the Russian ransomware scene is,” so targeting gangs there now before they grow bigger is important, he said.



The breaking of a BEC operation could also be significant, he added, because, in aggregate, crooks around the world pull in more money from business email scams than from ransomware, DiMaggio said.

Operation Sentinel is the second major anti-cybercrime operation in Africa this year. In August, Interpol announced the second stage of Operation Serengeti that saw the arrest of 1,209 people, the dismantling of over 11,400 malicious IT infrastructures, and the recovery of just over $97 million. This operation also dealt with high-impact cybercrimes including ransomware, online scams, and BEC scams.



Other enforcement efforts



These operations were among significant moves against threat actors globally in 2025.



Operation Endgame, an ongoing international anti-botnet effort coordinated by Europol, went after threat actors subscribing to the Smokeloader pay-per-install botnet, took down some 300 servers behind the malware used to distribute ransomware, and, in November, took down or disrupted 1,025 servers including the Elysium botnet, the enabler of the Rhadamanthys infostealer and VenomRAT remote access trojan.



Separately, authorities in the US, Finland, and the Netherlands teamed up to take down AVCheck, one of the largest counter-antivirus services used by criminals around the world.



As well, the Five Eyes intelligence sharing group, consisting of the US, the UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, accused China of supporting threat actors who are attacking critical infrastructure in a number of countries, and Microsoft got a court order allowing it to seize and block 2,300 domains behind the distribution of another infostealer, Lumma Stealer.

An uphill battle



Ed Dubrovsky, chief operating officer of incident response firm Cypfer, said the breaking of six ransomware strains is good news. But, he added, the cybercrime industry is more than ever focused on data theft as opposed to data encryption, and in some cases, data destruction after theft.



“Law enforcement action against cybercrime is of critical importance,” he added. “Without some level of deterrence, and given the upside from a financial [perspective] and other motives, cybercrime would have been much more prevalent and impactful.



“With that said, cybercrime is still a multibillion dollar market, and law enforcement suffers from limited resources and proper ongoing training. Some countries, such as the US, are far ahead of others from a sophistication and effectiveness perspective … Law enforcement is effective, partially, and in very specific areas of cybercrime, and in other areas, the effectiveness is still a work in progress.”



Some threat actors have great IT expertise, he added, and are taking advantage of AI. “Therefore, I believe law enforcement is achieving great impact in reducing cybercrime while also fighting an uphill battle.”



Attackers likely to expand efforts worldwide



Christian Leuprecht, a Canadian university professor and expert on national security, cybercrime, and money laundering, noted Africa’s population is set to double in the next 25 years, and it has the youngest population structure of any continent. The combination of a highly innovative and increasingly sophisticated workforce in some of the most politically, economically, and socially unsustainable countries in the world will be likely to generate a host of sophisticated local threat actors vying for economic survival and prosperity, with a potentially global reach. 



For now, he said, they are going after local targets, likely because they’re less resilient to attack and exploitation. But as local firms harden their cyber defenses, these African-based threat actors are bound to expand their operations globally. 



More, better, and proactive local disruption and enforcement capacity against these threat actors is critical to prevent them from becoming global in scale, he said.



“The scale and sophistication of cyberattacks across Africa are accelerating, especially against critical sectors like finance and energy,” Neal Jetton, Interpol’s director of cybercrime, said in a statement. “The outcomes from Operation Sentinel reflect the commitment of African law enforcement agencies, working in close coordination with international partners. Their actions have successfully protected livelihoods, secured sensitive personal data, and preserved critical infrastructure.”



Operation Sentinel not only used the resources of law enforcement agencies, but also was assisted by efforts from cybersecurity companies including Team Cymru, The Shadowserver Foundation, Trend Micro, TRM Labs, and Uppsala Security.

IO Interactive's 007 First Light has been delayed until May 27,"IO Interactive&#39;s James Bond simulator 007 First Light has been delayed until May 27, 2026. It was supposed to come out in March. The company says two-month delay is for polish and refinement, which is fine by me. I&#39;d always rather wait a bit longer for a better end product.
IO says the game is already &#34;fully playable from beginning to end&#34; but still needs a bit of attention to ensure &#34;the strongest possible version at launch.&#34; The developer promises to share more updates at the beginning of next year.
For the uninitiated, 007 First Light is the first James Bond game in over a decade. The developer is the same organization behind the renowned Hitman franchise, so this could potentially be the best Bond game since Goldeneye.

The gameplay looks fast-paced, frenetic and filled with spycraft. It features an original story that pulls from all over the decades-long franchise. We got a chance to speak to narrative director Martin Emborg and he noted that the game stars a young and inexperienced Bond, which seems to be the direction Amazon is taking with its upcoming film.
The game also boasts a pretty stacked cast. Patrick Gibson, from The OA and Dexter: Original Sin, plays the famous lothario spy and Lenny Kravitz has been cast as the primary villain. Other cast members include Lennie James, Kiera Lester, Alastair Mackenzie and Priyanga Burford.

Who knows when the next Bond film will actually come out, so this should be a nice little stopgap for fans.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/io-interactives-007-first-light-has-been-delayed-until-may-27-194809718.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F8d136310-e032-11f0-b76b-cb7e5fd63062&resize=1400%2C807&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=3febd135c8d354b9dc33cfee0a4e60f0b286a80a,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/io-interactives-007-first-light-has-been-delayed-until-may-27-194809718.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-23T19:48:09Z,8,Tech

MacSync Stealer malware bypasses macOS Gatekeeper security warnings,"
		
					  
						




The MacSync Stealer macOS malware can now infect victims’ computers using what appears to be a legitimate application with minimal user interaction, according to Apple device management and security vendor Jamf.



Until now, macOS campaigns needed to persuade users to launch infected applications through relatively intrusive techniques such as ClickFix social engineering or the expert user macOS ‘drag-to-terminal’ routine.



MacSync Stealer, by contrast, is downloaded from an ordinary-looking utility URL as a code-signed and notarized Swift application. Once the user initiates installation, the dropper retrieves its malware payload script from a command-and-control server.



One oddity is that the download still invites victims to launch it by right-clicking and opening, even though the signed executable does not technically need this for infection.



The innovation lies with its deceptive provenance: because the malware is signed by what macOS deems to be a legitimate developer and has not shown up as malicious, no warnings or extra steps are needed. This draws attention to a weakness in Apple’s Gatekeeper security – criminals can constantly reformulate their malware to evade Apple’s automated detection and notarization system.



This gives attackers a window for exploitation. According to Jamf, the malware’s certificate credential was only revoked after the company reported the issue to Apple.



Sign of expansion



MacSync Stealer is the latest example of an expanding number of economically motivated macOS malware. The purpose is to steal data from high-value users, including account credentials, API keys, and crypto wallet data.



The malware’s origins lie with an earlier Mac infostealer, Mac.c Stealer, whose appeal was that it could be bought cheaply by budding cybercriminals. However, within weeks of its appearance in April, this was rebranded as MacSync and more advanced features were added.



Another macOS stealer, the Odyssey infostealer, had also been observed using the same distribution technique.



“While MacSync Stealer itself is not entirely new, this case highlights how its authors continue to evolve their delivery methods,” Jamf said.



“This shift in distribution reflects a broader trend across the macOS malware landscape, where attackers increasingly attempt to sneak their malware into executables that are signed and notarized, allowing them to look more like legitimate applications.”



While the Mac malware “market” might appear small in volume compared to that for Windows, this largely reflects the fact that PCs remain the primary operating system used by businesses. Nevertheless, criminals have noticed that the extra development time required for Mac malware is increasingly worth it.



Examples targeting enterprises and high-value individuals from 2025 include the macOS Ferret family and BlueNoroff social media campaigns associated with North Korean hackers, both connected to crypto theft. Another is the Atomic malware-as-a-service (MaaS) infostealer associated with Russian cybercriminals.

Xbox cloud gaming comes to newer Amazon Fire TV models,"Xbox has brought cloud gaming gaming to some Amazon Fire TV models. These include the Fire TV 4-Series and the Fire TV Omni QLED Series. This lets people play Xbox games directly on the television, without needing a bulky console or even something like a Fire TV stick. 
Gamers do need a couple of things. First and foremost, this service requires a subscription to Game Pass. Plans start at $10 a month and shoot all the way up to $30 per month. They&#39;ll also need a compatible wireless controller, though most Bluetooth-enabled gamepads should work.
Amazon
The feature works for every game on the Game Pass platform and will also stream many titles that people own outright via the &#34;stream your own game&#34; feature. This won&#39;t work with everything, but hundreds of titles are supported. 
Amazon says this is just the beginning and that more TV models will receive the functionality in the future. Xbox Game Pass became available on select Amazon streaming devices earlier this year. Today&#39;s move makes sense, given that Fire TVs and the company&#39;s streaming sticks use the same OS. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-cloud-gaming-comes-to-newer-amazon-fire-tv-models-163517432.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2Ffa407d60-e019-11f0-a3df-17ef21f1cfd0&resize=1400%2C864&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=5d976f41219bfa0adb8178f88c27c1895ddd7e93,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-cloud-gaming-comes-to-newer-amazon-fire-tv-models-163517432.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-23T16:35:17Z,10,Tech

New York Times reporter files lawsuit against AI companies,"Investigative reporter John Carreyrou of the New York Times filed a lawsuit against xAI, Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, Meta and Perplexity on Monday for allegedly training their AI models on copyrighted books without permission. Carreyrou is perhaps best known for exposing the Theranos fraudulent blood test scandal.
According to Reuters, the lawsuit was filed alongside five other writers who all claim big tech companies have been violating their intellectual property rights in the name of building large language models.
This comes after a banner year for IP lawsuits against AI companies brought by rights holders. Just about every type of entity that deals in protected content has gone to court against AI companies this year, from movie studios like Disney and Warner Bros. to papers like the New York Times and the Chicago Tribune. Some of these cases have led to settlements in the form of partnerships, such as the licensing deal between Disney and OpenAI.
It&#39;s notable that this case is being brought by a small group of individuals instead of as a class action, something the authors involved say is no accident. &#34;LLM companies should not be able to so easily extinguish thousands upon thousands of high-value claims at bargain-basement rates,&#34; the complaint reads. This is also the first case of its kind to list xAI as a defendant.
A spokesperson for Perplexity told Reuters that the company &#34;doesn&#39;t index books.&#34; Anthropic, for its part, is no stranger to lawsuits from book publishers, having recently settled a class-action lawsuit brought by half a million authors for $1.5 billion. Apple was also sued earlier this year amid similar allegations. This latest complaint mentions the Anthropic settlement specifically, saying that class members in that case will only receive &#34;a tiny fraction (just 2 percent) of the Copyright Act’s statutory ceiling of $150,000.&#34;
Engadget has reached out to xAI, Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, Meta and Perplexity for comment and will update with any response.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/new-york-times-reporter-files-lawsuit-against-ai-companies-161624268.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F733d7640-df9e-11f0-bbf3-d33a42ed9b2c&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=e72050b8bb7efcd7ce5cf8893c5d7190bf10125e,https://www.engadget.com/ai/new-york-times-reporter-files-lawsuit-against-ai-companies-161624268.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-23T16:16:24Z,8,Tech

"Amazon has stopped 1,800 job applications from North Korean agents","
		
					  
						




Amazon’s chief security officer Stephen Schmidt writes that since April 2024, the company has stopped over 1800 job applications suspected of coming from North Korean agents. The number of applications linked to North Korea has also increased by about 27% per quarter in 2025.



The purpose of the infiltration is said to be to obtain remote employment with foreign companies, mainly in the United States, and then transfer the income to North Korea’s weapons program.



Amazon combines AI-based analysis with manual review to detect suspicious applications. Algorithms search for links to at-risk institutions, anomalies in applications, and geographic inconsistencies. Identities are verified through background checks, references, and structured interviews.



According to Schmidt, the company has seen several recurring trends. Identity theft is becoming more sophisticated, with fraudsters posing as real developers. Hijacked LinkedIn accounts are being used to boost credibility, and AI and machine learning jobs are particularly vulnerable targets.



Some operators use so-called “laptop farms” in the US to give the impression of local presence, and fake educational credentials from US universities are common. According to Amazon, even small details, such as phone numbers written with a country code of “1”, can help reveal fake profiles.



Amazon says that the problem is likely to be industry-wide and urges other companies to review their identity verification practices and report suspicious cases to authorities such as the FBI.

French postal service brought down by cyber attack,"
		
					  
						




France’s postal service, La Poste, has been largely down for over twelve hours following a widespread network failure, reports The Register.



All of La Poste’s IT systems are reportedly affected, including the website, the digital document service Digiposte, a digital ID service and the mobile app. It is still possible to handle cases over the counter.



La Poste’s bank, Banque Postales, app and online services are also down. Payments and SMS verification should still work.



La Poste has not said what caused the failure, but according to Le Monde Informatique it is a DDoS attack. It is unclear when the situation will be resolved and whether it could affect deliveries for Christmas.

Apple's iOS 26.3 will introduce proximity pairing to third-party devices in the EU,"Apple is making it a little easier to use third-party devices with iPhones in order to comply with Europe&#39;s Digital Market Act (DMA), MacRumors reported. For iOS 26.3, Apple&#39;s devices will support third-party proximity pairing and notifications in Europe only, according to the latest beta notes. That will make it a bit easier to connect devices like Sony headphones or receive notifications from an iPhone on Wear OS smartwatches — provided manufacturers support the new feature. 
&#34;The DMA creates new opportunities for developers to bring to market innovative products and services in Europe,&#34; an EU spokesperson told The Wall Street Journal. &#34;This is another step towards a more inter-connected digital ecosystem to the benefit of all EU citizens.&#34; The EU Commission added that the functionality will be &#34;fully available&#34; in the bloc in 2026.
The new capabilities are as follows:

Proximity pairing - Devices like earbuds will be able to pair with an iOS device in an AirPods-like way by bringing the accessory close to an iPhone or iPad to initiate a simple, one-tap pairing process. Pairing third-party devices will no longer require multiple steps.
Notifications - Third-party accessories like smart watches will be able to receive notifications from the ‌iPhone‌. Users will be able to view and react to incoming notifications, which is functionality normally limited to the Apple Watch. Notifications can only be forwarded to one connected device at a time, and turning on notifications for a third-party device disables notifications to an Apple Watch.

Proximity pairing is a relatively minor quality-of-life upgrade, allowing you to connect with a tap via NFC rather than diving into the Bluetooth settings. However, there&#39;s no indication that it will allow seamless switching between devices as you can do with Apple&#39;s iPods, for instance. Notifications, however, will finally make third-party watches feasible with iOS devices. 
Apple&#39;s DMA compliance efforts are interesting to watch, as it appears to be doing the bare minimum required, often for what it calls privacy reasons. In some cases, the company is removing features in Europe that are available elsewhere, like iPhone mirroring on Mac — meaning it doesn&#39;t have to implement the same feature on Android devices or PCs. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apples-ios-263-will-introduce-proximity-pairing-to-third-party-devices-in-the-eu-133037696.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F92ed12b0-dff4-11f0-bbf7-8af5355e9455&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=fc38d492820ec364800478b4808e7f7eabaa3252,https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apples-ios-263-will-introduce-proximity-pairing-to-third-party-devices-in-the-eu-133037696.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-23T13:30:37Z,7,Tech

One-time codes used to hack corporate accounts,"
		
					  
						




Security firm Proofpoint has discovered that hackers have found a clever way to bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA) and thereby get their hands on accounts belonging to corporate users.



In a nutshell, the hackers are using one-time codes from OAuth 2.0, an open standard that is supposed to be used to authenticate smart TVs and the like.



Typically, the scammers pretend that a particular device needs a one-time code and get users to type the code into Microsoft’s authentication link. Once users do so, the hackers gain full access to their Microsoft 365 accounts with all their content.



Both Russian and Chinese hackers have used this method, so there’s every reason for companies to tighten up their procedures.

Why outsourced cyber defenses create systemic risks,"
		
					  
						




Outsourcing critical IT and cybersecurity once looked like a shortcut to efficiency. Today, it is a shortcut to systemic fragility.



Breaches at one vendor now cascade across hundreds of organizations. A corporate decision framed as a cost-saving measure can trigger risks that extend across industries, even nations. The SolarWinds breach showed how a compromised supplier became a launchpad for global espionage. The MOVEit breach exposed how a single vulnerability could compromise sensitive data across governments, banks, and schools.



If you sit on a board, lead a cyber function, or regulate markets, you can no longer treat outsourcing as a local concern. It is a systemic risk. Left ungoverned, outsourcing can magnify operational weaknesses, fuel cybercrime, and expose firms to geopolitical pressure. Left unchecked, it poses a threat to global economic security.



This piece will guide you through the drivers of outsourcing, the risks it has unleashed, how these risks now escalate into systemic threats, the governance gap that enables them to thrive, and the responsibilities each stakeholder must shoulder.



Why outsourcing took off



The rise of outsourcing wasn’t a conspiracy. It was a rational response to competitive pressure.



First came the economics. Outsourcing promised lower costs. A CIO could reduce headcount, offshore operations, and still meet budget targets without raising capital. Then came the talent squeeze. Security engineers were scarce. Outsourcing gave firms access to global pools of expertise. Cloud adoption turbocharged the trend. Instead of building everything in-house, firms leaned on managed services and third-party platforms to scale fast.



Trust was often assumed, not engineered. The World Economic Forum has highlighted these “trust gaps.” Boards signed contracts with providers without embedding trust frameworks or demanding systemic assurances. Leaders gave vendors the keys to critical systems, with few checks on how those keys were safeguarded.



You may save money and move faster. But if you fail to demand trust at the core, you inherit fragility.



Risk categories of outsourced IT &amp; cybersecurity



When you outsource, responsibility shifts, but accountability never leaves you. The risks fall into clear categories.



Operational risks



The most basic risk is fragile continuity. In 2017, British Airways outsourced parts of its IT operations. A system outage grounded flights worldwide. The vendor contract delivered savings, but it also created single points of failure. When that single point snapped, the damage was immediate and global.



A recent cyber-attack targeting airport check-in systems caused significant disruptions, including delays and system failures, across multiple European airports, such as Heathrow. It also reveals that the attack exploited vulnerabilities in shared infrastructure, raising serious concerns about the security of aviation support systems.



Cyber risks



SolarWinds remains the textbook case. Hackers compromised a widely used software update. Thousands of government agencies and Fortune 500 firms installed the backdoor, believing it came from a trusted vendor. MOVEit, a more recent breach, showed the same weakness in a different form: data transfer software was compromised, exposing millions of records across multiple jurisdictions. One weak vendor poisoned an entire ecosystem.



AI-agent threats



The rise of autonomous AI adds a new layer of complexity. WEF has flagged how cybercriminals are already deploying AI agents to automate attacks. Imagine outsourced IT monitored by tools vulnerable to hostile AI. A malicious agent can probe for weaknesses, adapt in real time, and exploit outsourced environments at scale. This is no longer science fiction; it is market reality.



Compliance risks



Cross-border outsourcing introduces accountability gaps. Regulators demand GDPR, DORA, or sector-specific compliance, but vendors spread data across multiple jurisdictions. When breaches occur, responsibility is blurred. Firms argue that vendors failed. Vendors say that clients misunderstood the model. Meanwhile, regulators and customers hold the original brand accountable.



Geopolitical risks



Outsourcing to hostile or unstable regions turns business contracts into national security concerns. In 2021, the Kaseya ransomware attack, launched through an IT management platform used by MSPs, spread through thousands of companies worldwide. The attackers operated from jurisdictions beyond the reach of effective law enforcement. Global security became hostage to one supply chain decision.



Fresh case studies



The risks are not historic. In 2023, hackers breached a Boeing subsidiary, disrupting the production of aircraft parts. A breach at UnitedHealth crippled healthcare payments across the US, leaving hospitals scrambling. These are not niche events. They serve as reminders that outsourcing can turn corporate risks into public crises.



From local problems to systemic threats



Outsourcing risks do not stay contained. They scale.



SolarWinds showed how a single compromised supplier could infect the digital bloodstream of government and industry. The Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack disrupted fuel supply across the eastern United States. In 2025, ransomware at UnitedHealth halted healthcare reimbursements, disrupting a sector that affects millions.



Economic disruption follows. Integrity360 has reported multiple 2025 global attacks with damages running into billions. A local failure in one vendor cascades through supply chains. If that vendor supports critical infrastructure, the consequences magnify.



Global interdependencies make the weakest link the decisive one. Your cybersecurity posture may be robust. But if your vendor is compromised, you inherit their weakness. And if their subcontractor is compromised, the weakness doubles. This is why outsourcing is no longer a firm-level risk. It is systemic.



The governance gap



Why does this fragility persist? Because governance has lagged behind reality.



Boards often focus on efficiency. They pressure executives to cut costs and accelerate digital adoption. But they fail to demand trust-based vendor oversight. They rarely ask how vendor risks are classified, monitored, or tested. They rarely challenge management on concentration risk.



Regulators are fragmented. Some impose reporting rules. Others set sector-specific standards. But there is little global alignment. Cybercriminals exploit this patchwork. They attack through cross-border vendors, knowing compliance is reactive and uneven.



CISOs face their own limits. They may demand audits, but their leverage over subcontractors is weak. Supply chain visibility fades after the first tier. Even when CISOs are aware of the risks, budget constraints, contracts, and governance inertia limit their ability to act.



Add AI to the mix. Regulators have not yet prepared for AI-driven cybercrime. Many boards still view AI as an innovation story, rather than a threat multiplier. This blind spot will cost dearly when AI-driven attacks target outsourced environments.



Towards responsible outsourcing



Abandoning outsourcing is unrealistic. The task is to govern it responsibly.




Trust by design. WEF has recommended embedding trust frameworks into outsourcing contracts. This means defining expectations for transparency, accountability, and resilience upfront. You cannot assume trust; you must structure it.



AI resilience. Organizations must monitor outsourced environments for AI-agent threats. This requires investing in AI-native defenses, anomaly detection, and joint monitoring with vendors to ensure seamless integration.



Vendor stress tests. Europe’s DORA and NIS2 regulations mandate stress testing of critical third parties. These should become global norms. Firms must treat vendors the way banks treat capital stress tests, by planning for failure before it occurs.



Positive practices. Some firms are moving in the right direction. Banks are adopting multi-cloud strategies to reduce concentration risk. Zero-trust models ensure vendors only access what they need, when they need it. Continuous monitoring detects issues before they escalate and become more severe.




The lesson is clear. Responsible outsourcing is not about cost arbitrage. It is about resilience design.



Who must do what



Risk ownership is collective. But responsibilities differ.




Boards. You must demand trust-based vendor oversight. You cannot relegate vendor risk to a quarterly risk report; you must build it into governance charters. Demand resilience metrics. Approve investments in redundancy. Ask about the exit strategy in case a critical vendor fails.



CISOs. You carry the operational burden. Map your critical vendor dependencies. Negotiate accountability clauses in SLAs. Do not accept vague promises. Push for real-time risk monitoring. Run tabletop exercises that include vendor failure scenarios. Integrate AI threat detection into third-party tracking.



Regulators. You must align standards across borders. Fragmentation is a gift to cybercriminals. Mandate stress tests for systemic vendors. Demand transparency on subcontractors. Penalize opacity. Encourage information sharing across sectors. You cannot stop outsourcing, but you can ensure it is not blind outsourcing.




Conclusion: Someone else can’t carry your risk



Outsourcing will not disappear. In modern business, we weave it in, but if unmanaged, it risks systemic collapse.



The new dimension is AI. Cybercriminals are deploying autonomous agents to probe outsourced ecosystems. At the same time, trust gaps persist. Organizations outsource without embedding frameworks of accountability. Boards chase efficiency. Regulators remain reactive. CISOs lack visibility.



This is not sustainable. If outsourcing is to serve global competitiveness rather than undermine it, trust and resilience must be at its core. Boards must lead with oversight. CISOs must incorporate transparency into their contracts and monitoring processes. Regulators must harmonize and stress test.



The choice is stark. Either you govern outsourcing with discipline, or outsourcing governs you with fragility. The elephant in the biz is not outsourcing itself. It is the delusion that someone else can carry your risk for you.

2025 was the year Xbox died,"Want to see a dead body? I present to you the Xbox. After a subdued launch at the height of the COVID pandemic in 2020, the Xbox Series X quickly lost the fight against the PlayStation 5. Microsoft simply couldn&#39;t deliver enough compelling games, despite some huge acquisitions, while Sony leaned on its goodwill from the PS4 era and a handful of desirable exclusives. As prices rose due to supply chain issues and the Trump administration&#39;s volatile tariff scheme, there was even less of a reason to get an Xbox (even the cheaper Series S). When I re-reviewed the Series X last year, it was clear that it never lived up to its potential. Anyone in their right mind would be better off buying a PlayStation 5.Xbox didn&#39;t enter 2025 in a great state, and it&#39;s leaving the year grasping for help, like an Arc Raider player desperate for a revival after being knocked out. Microsoft cancelled the Perfect Dark reboot and Everwild, two of the most interesting games in its weak upcoming slate. The company brought titles like Forza Horizon 5 over to the PlayStation 5, which prompted Engadget Deputy Editor Nathan Ingraham to declare he no longer needed an Xbox. Xbox Series X controllerEngadgetMaking things worse this year, Microsoft raised prices across the board, with the Xbox Series S starting at $400 and the cheapest Series X going for a whopping $600. And slow sales prompted Costco to stop selling Xbox consoles entirely. Microsoft didn&#39;t even try to push systems during Black Friday — why go through the trouble of having sales if nobody is buying the hardware in the first place? Even Game Pass, which was once renowned as one of the best deals in gaming, almost doubled in price over the last year, reaching up to $30 a month (or $360 a year) for the Ultimate tier. Sure, Microsoft tried to add more value to its cheaper Game Pass tiers, and finally upgraded its cloud streaming platform, but the lack of consistent must-play exclusive titles has devalued the service (and Xbox as a whole). Avowed and South of Midnight were among the few exclusive highlights, but the latter will hit PS5 and Switch 2 next year. There&#39;s no word on Avowed reaching other consoles yet, but given Microsoft&#39;s current trajectory (and the fact that it&#39;s a genuinely great game), I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it becomes available elsewhere.There was a chance for Microsoft to reinvigorate the Xbox brand with the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X gaming handhelds, but the $600 and $1,000 launch prices placed them out of reach for most gamers. It also doesn&#39;t help that Windows still isn&#39;t well-optimized for portable devices with touchscreens, and those systems also aren&#39;t compatible with older Xbox titles like the consoles. At the very least, Microsoft now has a handheld foothold. But a future portable Xbox console would need to be significantly cheaper to compete with the likes of the Steam Deck, which starts at $400 (and is often on sale for much less).And speaking of Valve, the company&#39;s recently announced Steam Machine has also stolen a lot of potential thunder from Xbox. The Steam Machine is basically a tiny gaming desktop for your TV, running the Steam Deck&#39;s SteamOS. That platform is a Linux distribution optimized for emulating Windows titles. But unlike an Xbox console, it&#39;s not closed off in any way. You&#39;re free to install whatever you&#39;d like on a Steam Machine — even Windows!While we still haven&#39;t seen the Steam Machine in action, the Steam Deck&#39;s excellent performance and game compatibility makes me think its desktop sibling could be genuinely compelling to console players looking for something new. And it will likely directly compete with the next Xbox, which is rumored to arrive in 2027 as a PC in a TV-friendly case (according to Windows Central&#39;s Jez Corden). Microsoft&#39;s recent partnership deal with AMD also hints at a more PC-like experience — Xbox President Sarah Bond noted that the Xbox team is &#34;working closely with the Windows team to ensure that Windows is the number one platform for gaming.&#34;It&#39;s worth remembering that only a single generation of the Xbox — the Xbox 360 — was successful enough to truly compete with Sony&#39;s PlayStation. The original Xbox reportedly cost Microsoft $4 billion over the course of four years, leading the company to quickly jump ship and move to its successor. The Xbox 360 was genuinely innovative, thanks to Xbox Live and smarter online integration, and it had a healthy amount of third-party support. In comparison, Sony&#39;s PlayStation 3 was $100 to $200 more expensive than the Xbox 360 at launch, it had far worse online support and developers found it hard to program for.Xbox Series XDevindra Hardawar for EngadgetUnfortunately, Microsoft squandered most of its good will with the Xbox One. That console was first announced as an &#34;always online&#34; device with restrictive DRM features that limited how you could share and sell games; it was bundled with a Kinect camera that could potentially surveil you; and at $499, it was $100 more than the PlayStation 4. Microsoft quickly reversed many of its DRM-heavy plans for the Xbox One, but by that point the damage was done. Sony ultimately sold more than twice as many PS4 units as the entirety of the Xbox One family (which included the cheaper One S and more powerful One X), according to data from Ampere Research. Things are looking worse this generation: The Xbox Series S and X reportedly only sold around 33 million units as of July, according to Statista estimates, while Sony confirmed it sold 84.2 million PS5s as of November. If this trend continues (and it doesn’t appear as if Xbox sales will be increasing any time soon), Sony could end up selling three times as many consoles this generation, compared to Microsoft. Xbox sales have been so slow that the family-focused Nex Playground managed to outsell it in November, according to data from Circana.  Given Xbox&#39;s inability to compete with the PlayStation 5, it&#39;s no wonder Microsoft could be changing things up entirely for its next system. Its partnership with AMD could easily lead to new handhelds, and it also gives Microsoft a leg up in producing a compact and powerful Xbox PC. After all, why should the company keep trying to go toe-to-toe with Sony&#39;s closed PlayStation platform? Why shouldn&#39;t Microsoft embrace its PC roots to give us a gaming desktop under our TVs? The company has already committed to bringing new Xbox games to PCs immediately, so the line between the two is already blurring. It may be a risk, but evolving into a PC proves there’s still life in the Xbox brand. And crucially, it’s also something Sony can’t easily replicate.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/2025-was-the-year-xbox-died-130000467.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-09%2F60a886b0-958d-11f0-9f97-f1a1a9d20193&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=d17757bbe769b1741c56574b3bab632b5e921095,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/2025-was-the-year-xbox-died-130000467.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-23T13:00:00Z,15,Tech

South Korean firm hit with US investor lawsuit over data breach disclosure failures,"
		
					  
						




A US federal securities class action lawsuit has alleged that South Korean ecommerce giant Coupang took nearly a month to disclose a massive data breach to regulators, violating SEC rules that require companies to report material cybersecurity incidents within four business days.



The lawsuit, filed December 18, came just two days after Coupang finally submitted a Form 8-K disclosure to the Securities and Exchange Commission — 28 days after discovering the breach on November 18.



The complaint alleges that CEO Bom Kim and CFO Gaurav Anand knew or recklessly disregarded that the company had “inadequate cybersecurity protocols” allowing a former employee to access customer data for nearly six months without detection. The breach exposed personal information from 33.7 million customer accounts, Coupang said.



Disclosure deadline missed



The SEC adopted cybersecurity disclosure rules in July 2023, requiring companies to disclose material incidents within four business days of determining materiality, under item 1.05 of Form 8-K. Companies can delay disclosure only if the US Attorney General determines it poses substantial national security or public safety risks.



The complaint alleges that Coupang did not receive such an exemption. The company should have filed by November 24, following its November 18 discovery of the breach, but waited until December 16.



Between discovery and disclosure, media reports prompted organizational upheaval. Park Dae-jun, CEO of Coupang’s South Korean operations, resigned December 10 after stating he would “take full responsibility for both the incident and the handling of the case.” Harold Rogers, Coupang’s general counsel and chief administrative officer, assumed the role of interim CEO of the Korean subsidiary.



Coupang founder and CEO Bom Kim declined to appear at a South Korean parliamentary hearing about the breach, citing business obligations — a decision lawmakers condemned as a “systematic evasion of corporate responsibility.”



Authentication keys left unrevoked after employee departure



Investigators traced the breach to a former employee who retained valid authentication credentials after leaving the company in 2024, according to statements by South Korean lawmaker Choi Min-hee. The individual, a 43-year-old Chinese national, had worked on authentication management systems and joined Coupang in November 2022.



Rep. Choi Min-hee, chair of the National Assembly’s Science, ICT, Broadcasting and Communications Committee, released analysis results in a November 30 press release pointing to failures in basic security procedures. The company failed to renew or revoke signing keys — the cryptographic credentials used to issue access tokens—when the employee left.



“Abandoning a long-term valid authentication key was not simply a deviation by an internal employee, but the result of organizational and structural problems at Coupang that neglected the authentication system,” Choi said in the press release.



Coupang’s own information to lawmakers indicated the company set token signing key validity periods of five to ten years, with rotation periods varying by key type.



Legal test case for SEC cybersecurity rules



Legal observers noted the Coupang lawsuit appears to be among the first securities class actions directly challenging compliance with the SEC’s 2023 cybersecurity disclosure guidelines.



“This is a specific reason why I find the new Coupang lawsuit particularly interesting, and that is because one of the suit’s major allegations is that the company allegedly failed to make the requisite disclosures under the SEC’s cybersecurity disclosure guidelines,” legal journal, The D&amp;O Diary, wrote in an analysis of the case.



The complaint also alleges Coupang made materially false statements in quarterly reports filed in August and November 2025. Those reports incorporated risk disclosures from the company’s 2024 Annual Report detailing encryption technology and security measures — statements the complaint said “materially understated Coupang’s risk of a material cybersecurity event.”



When Coupang finally filed its Form 8-K, the company stated it had activated incident response procedures, blocked unauthorized access, and reported the incident to Korean authorities. The filing acknowledged Korean regulators “will potentially impose financial penalties” but said the company could not reasonably estimate losses.



Regulatory scrutiny in South Korea



In South Korea, Coupang faces potential fines up to 1.2 trillion won ($814 million) under the Personal Information Protection Act, which requires companies to notify regulators within 24 hours of discovering a breach and maintain appropriate safeguards.



South Korean police raided Coupang’s Seoul headquarters twice as part of their investigation. President Lee Jae Myung called for expanded class action lawsuit provisions, saying “every Korean has been affected” by the breach affecting nearly two-thirds of the country’s 51.7 million population.



The lawsuit seeks to establish a class of investors who purchased Coupang securities between August 6 and December 16. Multiple law firms have announced they are investigating similar claims. A case management conference is scheduled for March 20.

CES 2026: Everything we're expecting from tech's biggest conference in January,"As we hurtle towards the end of the year, the shadow of CES hovers on the horizon. Tech’s biggest annual conference is starting in just under two weeks, and we already know some of the products and announcements that could be in store. The CES 2026 show floor is officially open from January 6 through 9, but the fun kicks off with events on Sunday January 4 and a host of press conferences on Monday. As always, product demos, announcements and networking will be happening at the Las Vegas Convention Center and other hotels all over the city. As usual, Engadget will be covering the event in-person and remotely, bringing you news and hands-ons straight from the show floor.More specific details and pre-announcements are already trickling out as CES approaches, and thanks to the CTA’s schedule we also do know what companies will be hosting press conferences. We’re also using our experience and expertise to predict what tech trends could rear their heads at the show.What we already know aboutPress conferences and show floor booths are the bread and butter of CES. The Consumer Technology Association has already published a searchable directory of who will have a presence at the show, along with a schedule of every official panel and presentation.On Sunday, January 4, Samsung will kick-off CES with &#34;The First Look,&#34; a presentation hosted by TM Roh, the CEO of Samsung&#39;s DX Division, on the company&#39;s &#34;vision for the DX (Device eXperience) Division in 2026, along with new AI-driven customer experiences.&#34; That&#39;ll be followed by multiple press conferences throughout Monday, January 5. LG is hosting its &#34;Innovation in Tune with You&#34; presentation to share &#34;its vision for elevating daily life through Affectionate Intelligence&#34; at the start of the day, Intel is launching its new Core Ultra Series 3 processors in the afternoon, Sony Honda Mobility is holding a press conference on its first car and AMD CEO Lisa Su will cover AMD&#39;s upcoming chip announcements at a keynote address that closes out the day.On the week of December 15, the CTA added a keynote by NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang to its schedule. The event will take place on January 5 at 1PM PT and, according to the website, will last about 90 minutes. Based on the description on the listing, the presentation will “showcase the latest NVIDIA solutions driving innovation and productivity across industries.”Finally, on Tuesday, January 6, Lenovo CEO Yuanqing Yang will host Lenovo&#39;s Tech World Conference at Sphere, using the large and decidedly curved screen to share the company&#39;s &#34;commitment to delivering smarter AI for all by constantly redefining how technology can engage, inspire, and empower.&#34; It’s worth noting that Lenovo is the parent company of Motorola, which still makes phones and foldables that feature AI tools, so it’s possible those devices feature in the presentation as well. As they typically do, some companies have already gotten a headstart on the CES news by publicly sharing their announcements in the weeks leading up to January. LG, for example, has said it will debut its first Micro RGB television at CES. While details are scarce, the company’s press release for the LG Micro RGB evo did confirm it has received certifications by Intertek for 100 percent color gamut coverage in DCI-P3 an Adobe RGB, and that it has more than a thousand dimming zones for brightness control.Not to be forgotten, Samsung also announced it will be launching a whole lineup of Micro RGB TVs at CES. The company already introduced its first Micro RGB TV at CES 2025, which was a 115-inch model available for a cool $30,000. Next year, Samsung is expanding the range with 55-, 65-, 75-, 85-, 100- and 115-inch models that use the next evolution of the company’s Micro RGB technology. Outside of the formal introduction of new products and initiatives, reading the tea leaves of what was announced last year and what companies are reportedly working on, we can make some educated guesses at what we could see at CES 2026.New chips from AMD, Intel and QualcommCES is frequently the start of a cascade of new chip announcements for a given year, and one of the first places new silicon appears in real consumer products. AMD will likely use its keynote to introduce new versions of its Ryzen chips, including the recently spotted Ryzen 7 9850X3D, which is expected to offer better single-threaded performance, and the Ryzen 9000G series, which could be built with AMD&#39;s Zen 5 architecture. The company might also use its CES stage to go over its new FSR Redstone AI upscaling tech.Intel has already publicly announced that it&#39;ll launch its Panther Lake chips at CES 2026. The officially titled Intel Core Ultra Series 3 chips fit into Intel&#39;s overall &#34;AI PC&#34; push, but are specifically meant for premium laptops. Based on a preview from October 2025, Intel says the first chip made with its 2-nanometer 18A process will offer 50 percent more processing performance than previous generations and for the chip&#39;s Arc GPU, a 50 percent performance bump from last generation.Qualcomm is also rumored to be targeting laptops at the show, building on the work it&#39;s done moving its Snapdragon chips out of phones and tablets and into other types of computers. The company&#39;s Snapdragon X2 Elite and X2 Elite Premium chips should start appearing in laptops at CES 2026, offering a look at the improved speed and AI performance the company promised in 2025.Brighter, &#34;truer&#34; screensSony announced a collection of new Bravia TVs in April 2025, replacing the company&#39;s flagship, filling in its midrange options and adding a new budget model to the mix. The star of this updated Bravia lineup is the Bravia 9, which features a QD-OLED panel, but Sony appears to be prepping entirely new display tech for 2026. In March 2025, Sony introduced a new RGB LED panel that uses individual Mini LED backlights colored in red, green and blue to produce even brighter, more accurate colors. In contrast to a QD-OLED, which filters a layer of blue organic light emitting diodes through quantum dots that change color, Sony&#39;s &#34;General RGB LED Backlight Technology&#34; can get as bright as a Mini LED panel without needing an extra filter layer or worrying about OLED&#39;s problems with burn-in. The company has already trademarked the name &#34;True RGB,&#34; which could end up being what Sony calls this new flavor of display if it decides to show them off at CES. It seems entirely likely, because CES is nothing if not a TV show — it’s a sure bet that we’ll see new TVs from the likes of LG and Samsung in addition to Sony. If the company doesn&#39;t introduce new display tech for its TVs, it does have a new 240Hz PlayStation monitor coming in 2026 that it could show off at CES instead.Sony isn&#39;t the only company hyped on bright screens. Samsung is reportedly pushing an updated version of the HDR10 and HDR10+ standards that could be ready to demo at CES 2026. The new HDR10+ Advanced standard would be Samsung&#39;s answer to Dolby Vision 2, which includes support for things bi-directional tone mapping and intelligent features that automatically adapt sports and gaming content. Samsung&#39;s take will reportedly offer improved brightness, genre-based tone mapping and intelligent motion smoothing options, among other improvements.Ballie Watch 2026The ball-shaped yellow robot lovingly known as &#34;Ballie&#34; has been announced twice, first in 2020 and then again in 2024 with a projector in tow. Samsung said Ballie would go on sale in 2025 at CES last year and then shared in April 2025 that Ballie would ship this summer with Google&#39;s Gemini onboard. But it&#39;s nearly 2026, and Ballie is nowhere to be seen. It&#39;s possible Samsung could make a third attempt at announcing its robot at CES 2026, but whether or not it does, robotics will still be a big part of the show.Robot vacuums and mops were a major highlight of CES 2025, and it&#39;s safe to expect notable improvements from the new models that are announced at CES 2026. Not every company will adopt the retractable arm of the Roborock Saros Z70, but robot vacuums with legs for rising over small ledges like the Dreame X50 seem like they could become the norm. Roborock could also show off its new Roborock Qrevo Curv 2 Flow, the first of its robot vacuums to feature a retractable roller mop.Beyond just traversing spaces more efficiently, improving robots&#39; navigation could also be a major concern at the show. Prominent members of the AI industry are turning their attention from large language models to world models, which aim to give AI a deep understanding of physical space. Those world models could be the key to making robots, bipedal or otherwise, competent at navigating homes and workplaces, and will likely be a significant talking point at CES 2026.We’ll be updating this article throughout the month as more rumors surface and new products are confirmed — stay tuned for future updates!Update, December 11 2025, 11:03AM ET: This story has been updated to include detail on Lenovo being Motorola’s parent company and how the latter might have a part in the Tuesday presentation.Update, December 16 2025, 1:33PM ET: This story has been updated to include the NVIDIA press conference, which was added to the CTA schedule within the last two days.Update, December 23 2025, 7:28AM ET: This story has been updated to include LG and Samsung’s Micro RGB TV announcements, which were made public in the past seven days.

Not to mention the Switch 2, which is slowly building out its own exclusive library with Metroid Prime 4 and Donkey Kong Bananza. Rare for me, this year, I’ve played many of the new games we’ve picked. Brag. I’d recommend both Dispatch and Blue Prince — I still haven’t completed the latter, but, yes, I’ve unlocked the secret elevator.
And if you don’t have access to your usual PC or console setup, there are some smartphone games worth your time, including Spooky Express, Is This Seat Taken and, well, Umamusume: Pretty Derby, a reimagined world of horse racing where the horses are anime girls with horse ears. Try explaining that to your uncle over dinner.

US bans new foreign-made drones and components
Previously sold drones will not be affected.
Engadget
The Federal Communications Commission has assigned foreign-made drones and their critical components as prohibited to import into the US. The FCC said several national security agencies have determined that unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and their critical components produced in foreign countries pose an unacceptable risk to the United States’ national security.
FCC Chair Brendan Carr clarified on X the ban does not affect old drones. People can continue using the devices they’ve already purchased, and retailers can keep selling models already approved by the agency. One of the most well-known brands affected by the ban is Chinese company DJI, which told Engadget it was disappointed by the agency’s decision. “While DJI was not singled out, no information has been released regarding what information was used by the Executive Branch in reaching its determination,” a spokesperson said.

Pirate group Anna’s Archive says it has scraped Spotify in its entirety
The group says it has over 86 million tracks.

Anna’s Archive, the open-source search engine for shadow libraries, claims to have scraped Spotify’s entire music library. The group acquired metadata for approximately 256 million tracks, including 86 million songs, and the total size is just under 300 TB.
“A while ago, we discovered a way to scrape Spotify at scale. We saw a role for us here to build a music archive primarily aimed at preservation,” the group said in a blog post. In response, the streamer said: “Spotify has identified and disabled the nefarious user accounts that engaged in unlawful scraping. We’ve implemented new safeguards for these types of anti-copyright attacks and are actively monitoring for suspicious behavior.”

Foldable phone makers have solved every issue except one
The only issue is price.
Engadget
Google and Samsung have iterated their big foldables year on year for, well, years. But in 2025, they both delivered big phones that addressed prior flaws and issues. With the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Samsung achieved what may be an even bigger accomplishment by creating a foldable phone of essentially the same size and weight as its own S25 Ultra.
The one thing the makers of big foldables haven’t figured out is how to make them affordable. OnePlus came close in 2023 with the Open, which cost $1,500 after rebates. But things are actually going backwards. The launch price of the Z Fold 7 ($2,000) is $200 higher than the Z Fold 5’s debut price.

How to set up an Apple Watch for a child,"Giving a child an Apple Watch can offer extra peace of mind and tools that promote independence in a controlled way. Apple’s Family Setup feature makes it possible for a kid to use an Apple Watch without owning an iPhone, and the feature set has expanded thanks to recent watchOS updates. It supports communication controls, location tools, Schooltime limits and privacy protections that allow a parent or guardian to manage how the device is used throughout the day.
The setup process begins with creating or signing in with a child’s Apple ID. It continues with adding them to your Family Sharing group on an iPhone and pairing a compatible Apple Watch through the Apple Watch app. Once the watch is linked, you can adjust a range of parental controls that shape how the watch works at home, at school and when the child is out and about.
Confirm device compatibility
Family Setup requires a cellular-capable Apple Watch such as the Apple Watch SE or Series 6 or later. A cellular connection allows the watch to operate independently without an iPhone nearby. The watch must be running a recent version of watchOS and the iPhone used for setup must be running the latest iOS version.
If the watch is not new, it needs to be erased before it can pair with a new user. This can be done directly on the watch through the Settings menu by choosing the general reset option. Once the device is reset it can be paired again from the Apple Watch app.
Create or prepare your child&#39;s Apple ID
Family Setup relies on each child having their own Apple ID. This allows their data, messages, activity goals and device settings to remain separate from other people in the household. If your kid already has an Apple ID, it can be used during setup. If they do not have one, the Apple Watch app will prompt you to create one as you go through the pairing process.
A child’s Apple ID is linked to Family Sharing, which lets the organizer manage permissions from a single iPhone. A parent or guardian can approve contacts, handle screen time requests and view location updates without needing to touch the watch itself. Setting this up first ensures that the watch can be paired smoothly later.
Add the child to Family Sharing
Family Sharing is the foundation for managing the watch, and it’s all controlled through the Settings app on your iPhone. Once Family Sharing is open you can tap the option to add a family member then follow the prompts to link the child’s Apple ID to the group. This also makes you the family organizer, which gives you control of purchase approvals, communication limits and other shared features.
Once the child is added to Family Sharing their information becomes available when you begin pairing the Apple Watch. This makes the process faster since the watch can immediately associate itself with the correct Apple ID.
Pair the watch using Family Setup
Turn on the Apple Watch and place it near your iPhone. A prompt should appear directing you to use your iPhone for setup. If the prompt does not appear, you can open the Apple Watch app, go to All Watches and choose Add Watch. The app will then ask if the device is being set up for you or for a family member. Choose the family member option and continue.
The camera on your iPhone is used to pair the devices. Align the Apple Watch face inside the frame on your screen until the pairing animation is recognized. Once the connection is made the app will ask which family member the watch is for. Select the child’s profile to continue through the remaining steps.
The app will guide you through choosing which wrist the watch will be worn on, setting a passcode, signing in with the child’s Apple ID and enabling services such as Siri and location tracking. You can also set up activity goals tailored to the child’s age and fitness level.
Manage the watch from your iPhone
Once the Apple Watch is paired, the Watch app becomes the main place to manage how it works. The Family Setup interface is designed to give parents and guardians control without needing to handle the watch directly. Most adjustments can be made at any time from the iPhone used for setup.
Screen Time controls allow you to set limits for communication and app use. You can restrict access to certain features during specific times of day, create downtime schedules and manage content restrictions for websites and apps. These settings mirror the Screen Time system used on other Apple devices which makes it easier to keep rules consistent across the household.
Approved contacts can be managed through the communication limits menu. This ensures that the child can send messages and make calls only with approved people. If you add or remove contacts, they are updated instantly on the watch.
Location sharing is handled through the Find My app. You can view the child’s location and set notifications that alert you when they arrive at or leave a particular place. This is useful for school pickups or after-school activities. The watch uses on-device processing for location and messages which helps maintain privacy.
Configure Schooltime and Focus modes
School time is one of the most important parental controls for younger users. It limits interaction with the watch during school hours by locking access to most apps and features. Only the time and a simple yellow icon appear on the screen while Schooltime is active. You can schedule Schooltime from the Apple Watch app so that it automatically turns on and off at the right times each day.
Focus modes offer another layer of control. These modes can reduce distractions during homework, bedtime or other family routines. Each Focus mode can limit notifications and activity alerts so the child is not interrupted when they need to concentrate.
Set up safety features
Emergency SOS is enabled during setup and can be managed afterward in the Apple Watch app. It allows the child to contact emergency services by holding the side button. You can also assign an emergency contact who will receive a notification if SOS is triggered.
The Medical ID should include relevant details such as allergies or medical conditions. This information can be accessed by emergency responders if needed.
Adjust privacy and communication settings
The watch uses on-device processing for messages, location and Siri requests which helps protect your child’s data. Location sharing can be turned on or off at any time and you can manage which apps are allowed to use location services. Communication permissions can also be updated as the child’s needs change.
Apps installed on the watch can be controlled from the Apple Watch app. You can remove apps, restrict access or hide notifications at any time to maintain a balanced experience.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/how-to-set-up-an-apple-watch-for-a-child-120051230.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2Fapple-watch-se-3.JPG&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=15881e379b7f3d8c2ab59b360a8d87c0434e322b,https://www.engadget.com/wearables/how-to-set-up-an-apple-watch-for-a-child-120051230.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-23T12:00:51Z,9,Tech
"WhatsApp API worked exactly as promised, and stole everything","
		
					  
						




Security researchers have uncovered a malicious npm package that poses as a legitimate WhatsApp Web API library while quietly stealing messages, credentials, and contact data from developer environments.



The package, identified as “lotusbail,” operates as a trojanized wrapper around a genuine WhatsApp client library and had accumulated more than 50k downloads by the time it was flagged by Koi Security.



“With over 56000 downloads and functional code that actually works as advertised, it is the kind of dependency developers install without a second thought,” Koi researchers said in a blog post. “The package has been available on npm for 6 months and is still live at the time of writing.”



Stolen data was encrypted and exfiltrated to attacker-controlled infrastructure, reducing the likelihood of detection by network monitoring tools. Even more concerning for enterprises is the fact that Lotusbail abuses WhatsApp’s multi-device pairing to maintain persistence on compromised accounts even after the package is removed.



Legitimate API uses a proxy for threat



According to the researchers, lotusbail initially didn’t appear to be anything more than a helpful fork of the legitimate “@whiskeysockets/baileys” library used for interacting with WhatsApp via WebSockets. Developers could install it, send messages, receive messages, and never notice anything wrong.



Further probing, however, revealed an issue.



The package wrapped the legitimate WhatsApp WebSocket client in a malicious proxy layer that transparently duplicated every operation, including the ones involving sensitive data. During authentication, the wrapper captured session tokens and keys. Every message flowing through the application was intercepted, logged, and prepared for covert transmission to attacker-controlled infrastructure.



Additionally, the stolen information was protected en route. Rather than sending credentials and messages in plaintext, the malware employs a custom RSA encryption layer and multiple obfuscation strategies, making detection by network monitoring tools harder and allowing exfiltration to proceed under the radar.



“The exfiltration server URL is buried in encrypted configuration strings, hidden inside compressed payloads,” the researchers noted. “The malware uses four layers of obfuscation: Unicode variable manipulation, LZString compression, Base-91 encoding, and AES encryption. The server location isn’t hardcoded anywhere visible.”



Backdoor sticks around even after package removal



Koi said the most significant component of the attack was its persistence. WhatsApp allows users to link multiple devices to a single account through a pairing process involving an 8-character code. The malicious lotusbail package hijacked this mechanism by embedding a hardcoded pairing code that effectively added the attacker’s device as a trusted endpoint on the user’s WhatsApp account.



Even if developers or organizations later uninstalled the package, the attacker’s linked device remained connected. This allowed the attack to persist until the WhatsApp user manually unlinked all devices from the settings panel.



Persistent access allows the attackers to continue reading messages, harvesting contacts, sending messages on behalf of victims, and downloading media long after the initial exposure.



What must developers and defenders do?



Koi disclosure noted that traditional safeguards, based on reputation metrics, metadata checks, or static scanning, fail when malicious logic mimics legitimate behavior.



“The malware hides in the gap between ‘this code works’ and ‘this code does only what it claims’,” the researchers said, adding that such supply-chain threats require monitoring package behavior at runtime rather than relying on static checks alone. They recommended looking for (or relying on tools that can) warning signs, such as custom RSA encryption routines and dozens of embedded anti-debugging mechanisms in the malicious code.



The package remains available on npm, with its most recent update published just five days ago. GitHub, which has owned npm since 2020, did not immediately respond to CSO’s request for comment.

The best SSDs in 2026,"Upgrading to a good SSD can make your computer feel brand new again. Apps open faster, files move in a blink and even older machines start to feel a lot more responsive. It is one of the easiest ways to breathe life into a laptop or desktop without replacing the whole system, and the performance boost is something you notice right away.There are plenty of SSDs to choose from, though, and the naming alone can be confusing if you are not already familiar with the specs. Some drives are built for simple upgrades, while others offer speeds that benefit creators or gamers. To help you sort through it, we tested a wide mix of options and pulled together the best SSDs you can buy right now.

How we test SSDs 
I’ve either tested or personally use daily every storage drive recommended on this list. Out of our top picks, I bought four with my own money after doing about a dozen hours of research. Separately, Engadget Senior Reporter Jeff Dunn has also tested a handful of our recommendations, including the Crucial X9 Pro listed above. 
What to look for in a PC SSD 
The most affordable way to add fast storage space to a computer is with a 2.5-inch SATA drive. It’s also one of the easiest if you don’t want to worry about compatibility since almost every computer made in the last two decades will include a motherboard with Serial ATA connections. For that reason, the best SATA SSDs are an excellent choice if you want to extend the life of an older PC build. Installation is straightforward, too. Once you’ve secured the internal SSD in a drive cage, all you need to do is to connect it to your motherboard and power supply. 
The one downside of SATA drives is that, in terms of responsiveness, they’re slower than their high-performance NVMe counterparts, with SATA III limiting data transfers to 600MB/s. But even the slowest SSD will be significantly faster than the best mechanical drives. And with high-capacity, 1TB SATA SSDs costing about $100, they’re a good bulk-storage option. 
If your PC is newer, there’s a good chance it includes space for one or more M.2 SSDs. The form factor represents your ticket to the fastest SSDs on the market, but the tricky part is navigating all the different standards and specs involved. 
M.2 drives can feature either a SATA or PCIe connection. SSDs with the latter are known as Non-Volatile Memory or NVMe drives and are significantly faster than their SATA counterparts, with Gen3 models offering sequential write speeds of up to 3,000MB/s. These drives rely on NVMe NAND technology for their superior performance and durability. You can get twice the performance with a Gen4 SSD, but you’ll need a motherboard and processor that supports the standard. 
If you’re running an AMD system, that means at least a Ryzen 3000 or 5000 CPU and an X570 or B550 motherboard. With Intel, meanwhile, you’ll need at least an 11th or 12th Gen processor and a Z490, Z590 or Z690 motherboard. Keep in mind that Gen4 SSDs typically cost more than their Gen3 counterparts as well. 
More expensive still are the latest Gen5 models, which offer sequential read speeds of up to 16,000MB/s. However, even if your computer supports the standard, you’re better off buying a more affordable Gen4 or Gen3 drive. At the moment, very few games and applications can take advantage of Gen3 NVMe speeds, let alone Gen4 and Gen5 speeds. What’s more, Gen5 NVMe drives can run hot, which can lead to performance and longevity issues. Your money is better spent on other components, like upgrading your GPU, for now. 
As for why you would buy an M.2 SATA drive over a similarly specced 2.5-inch drive, it comes down to ease of installation. You add M.2 storage to your computer by installing the SSD directly onto the motherboard. That may sound intimidating, but in practice the process involves a single screw that you first remove to connect the drive to your computer and then retighten to secure the SSD in place. As an added bonus, there aren’t any wires involved, making cable management easier. 
Note that you can install a SATA M.2 SSD into an M.2 slot with a PCIe connection, but you can’t insert an NVMe M.2 SSD into a M.2 slot with a SATA connection. Unless you want to continue using an old M.2 drive, there’s little reason to take advantage of that feature. Speaking of backward compatibility, it’s also possible to use a Gen4 drive through a PCIe 3 connection, but you won’t get any of the speed benefits of the faster NVMe. 
One last thing to consider is that M.2 drives come in different physical sizes. From shortest to longest, the common options are 2230, 2242, 2260, 2280 and 22110. (The first two numbers represent width in millimeters and the latter denote the length.) For the most part, you don’t have to worry about that since 2280 is the default for many motherboards and manufacturers. Some boards can accommodate more than one size of NVMe SSD thanks to multiple standoffs. That said, check your computer’s documentation or firmware before buying a drive to ensure you’re picking up a compatible size. 
If you’re buying a replacement SSD for the Steam Deck or Steam Deck OLED, things are less complicated. For Valve’s handheld, you will need a 2230 size NVMe. Simple. If you don’t want to open your Steam Deck, it’s also possible to expand its storage by installing a microSD card. Engadget has a separate guide dedicated to SD card storage, so check that out for additional buying advice. 
I alluded to this earlier, but the best buying advice I can offer is don’t get too caught up about being on the bleeding edge of storage tech. The sequential read and write speeds you see manufacturers list on their drives are theoretical and real-world performance benchmark tests vary less than you think. 
If your budget forces you to choose between a 1TB Gen3 NVMe and a 512GB Gen4 model, go for the higher-capacity one. From a practical standpoint, the worst thing you can do is buy a type of SSD that’s too small for needs. Drives can slow dramatically as they approach capacity, and you will probably end up purchasing one with a higher gigabyte capacity in the future. 
What to look for in portable and USB flash drives 
Portable SSDs are a somewhat different beast to their internal siblings. While read and write speeds are important, they are almost secondary to how an external drive connects to your PC. You won’t get the most out of a model like the SanDisk Extreme Pro V2 without a USB 3.2 Gen 2 x 2 connection. Even among newer PCs, that’s something of a premium feature. For that reason, most people are best off buying a portable drive with a USB 3.2 Gen 2 or Thunderbolt connection. The former offers transfer speeds of up to 10Gbps. The best external hard drives also allow you to transfer data from your Windows PC to a Mac, or other device, if compatible. Be sure to consider this beforehand if you plan to use your portable drive across multiple devices. 
Additionally, if you plan to take your drive on trips and commutes, it’s worthwhile to buy a model with IP-certified water and dust proofing. Some companies like Samsung offer rugged versions of their most popular drives, including the Samsung SSD T7 Shield, with a high endurance rating. For additional peace of mind, 256-bit AES hardware encryption will help prevent someone from accessing your data if you ever lose or misplace your external SSD. 
Some of the same features contribute to a great thumbstick drive. Our favorite picks for best budget external SSD models feature USB 3.0 connections and some form of hardware encryption. 
A note on console storage 

 
 
 
  Seagate
 
 
If PC gaming isn’t your thing and you own an Xbox Series X|S or PS5, outfitting your fancy new console with the fastest possible storage is far more straightforward than doing the same on PC. With a Series X or Series S, your options are limited to options from Seagate and Western Digital. The former offers 512GB, 1TB and 2TB models, with the most affordable starting at a not-so-trivial $90. Western Digital’s Expansion Cards are less expensive, with pricing starting at $80 for the 512GB model. The good news is that both options are frequently on sale. Your best bet is to set an alert for the model you want by using a price tracker like CamelCamelCamel. 
With Sony’s PlayStation 5, upgrading the console’s internal storage is slightly more involved. Instead of employing a proprietary solution, the PS5 uses NVMe storage. Thankfully, there aren’t as many potential configurations as you would find on a PC. Engadget maintains a comprehensive guide to the best SSDs for PS5; in short, your best bet is a high-capacity Gen4 drive with a built-in heatsink. Check out that guide for a full list of gaming SSD recommendations, but for a quick go-to, consider the Corsair MP600 Pro LPX I recommend above. It meets all the memory specifications for Sony’s latest console and you won’t run into any clearance issues with the heatsink. Corsair offers 500GB, 1TB, 2TB, 4TB and 8TB versions of the drive. Expect to pay about $110 for the 1TB variant and about $200 for 2TB. 
For those still playing on a previous generation console, you can get slightly faster game load times from a PlayStation 4 by swapping the included hard drive to a 2.5-inch SSD, but going out of your way to do so probably isn’t worth it at this point and you’re better off saving your money for one of the new consoles and updating your operating system instead. 
SSD FAQs 
What size SSD is best? 
There is no one size fits all rule for SSDs, but we generally recommend getting at least a 1TB SSD if you’re looking to upgrade PC or game console storage, or looking to add an external drive to your toolkit. A 1TB drive will be plenty for most people who need extra storage space for photos, documents and programs. If you’re a hardcore gamer, you may want to invest in even more storage considering many high-profile titles today can take up a ton of space. 
Is a 256GB SSD better than a 1TB hard drive? 
The short answer is that it depends on what you need your drive for. In general, SSDs are faster and more efficient than HDDs, but HDDs are usually cheaper. We recommend springing for an SSD for most use cases today — upgrading a PC, saving important photos and documents, storing games long term, etc. But if you’re focused on getting the most amount of extra space possible (and sticking to a budget), an HDD could be a good option for you. 
Does bigger SSD mean faster? 
Getting a bigger SSD doesn’t always translate into a faster drive overall. A bigger SSD will provide a higher storage capacity, which means more space for storing digital files and programs. To understand how fast an SSD will be, you’ll want to look at its read/write speeds: read speeds measure how fast a drive can access information, while write speeds measure how fast the drive can save information. Most SSDs list their approximate read/write speeds in their specs, so be sure to check out those numbers before you make a purchase.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-ssds-140014262.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F48f38fd0-d44c-11f0-bf1f-a1e65d279710&resize=1400%2C840&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=bd349e4c8a330e96185d411d6145f69263431ecc,https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-ssds-140014262.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-23T10:00:36Z,9,Tech

Agentic AI already hinting at cybersecurity’s pending identity crisis,"
		
					  
						




Making the most of agentic AI is a top agenda item for many enterprises the coming year, as business executives are keen to deploy autonomous AI agents to revamp a range of business operations and workflows.



The technology is nascent and, as with generative AI rollouts, CIOs are under pressure to move quickly with agentic AI strategies — a potential nightmare in making for CISOs charged with ensuring organizational security in the face of widespread agentic experimentation and deployment.



A key area of concern is identity and authentication. Some security experts estimate that more than 95% of enterprises deploying or experimenting with autonomous agents are doing so without leveraging existing cybersecurity mechanisms — such as public key infrastructure (PKI) — to track, identify, and control their agents.



This issue becomes even more dangerous due to the prevalence of agent-to-agent communications common to agentic AI rollouts.



For agentic AI to work, AI agents must communicate autonomously with other agents to pass tasks, data, and context. Without sufficient identity management, authentication, and related cybersecurity measures in place, not only could an agent be controlled by a cybercriminal or state actor, but rogue agents could engage in a variety of prompt injection attacks with an unlimited number of legitimate agents.



should a hijacked agent communicate with an enterprise’s legitimate agents before it is detected and its credentials are pulled, the damage from legitimate agents following the rogue agent’s instructions isn’t halted. 



And the likelihood of this knock-on effect isn’t trivial. Most robust authentication mechanisms today revoke and/or shut down credentials when bad behavior is detected. But behavioral analytics systems often need to witness acts of bad behavior before they can flag the problem to terminate the ID. Any actions previously initiated by the compromised agent will already be in motion across the agentic chain.



Having a trail of every interaction and an automated system for contacting all legitimate agents that interacted with the rogue agent to tell them to disregard instructions from that agent — and alert IT security of any actions already taken on the rogue’s instructions — is the goal, but vendors have yet to address this need. Moreover, many security experts argue it’s too complex a problem to easily solve.



“Because autonomous agents are increasingly able to execute real actions within an organization, if a malicious actor can affect the decision-making layer of an autonomous agent, the resulting damage could be exponentially greater than in a traditional breach scenario,”says Nik Kale, principal engineer at Cisco as well as a member of the Coalition for Secure AI (CoSAI) and ACM’s AI Security (AISec) program committee.



The ever-expanding attack surface of autonomous agents



“Because agents are programmed to follow instructions, they will likely follow a questionable instruction absent some mechanism to force the agent to slow its process to validate the safety of the request,” Kale says. “Humans have intuition and therefore often sense when something does not feel right. Agents do not possess this instinctual sense and thus will follow any request unless the system specifically prevents them from doing so.”



Gary Longsine, CEO at IllumineX, agrees that the cybersecurity risks from uncontrolled agentic deployment is unlike anything CISOs have faced.



“The attack surface of the AI agent could be thought of as essentially infinite, due to the natural language interface and the ability of the agent to summon a potentially vast array of other agentic systems,” Longsine says.



DigiCert CTO Jason Sabin suggests the situation may be even worse because of how relatively easy it is to perform an agent hijacking.



“Without robust agentic authentication, organizations risk deploying autonomous systems that can be hijacked with a single fake instruction,” Sabin claims. 



Agentic AI’s identity crisis



Authentication and agentic experts interviewed — three of whom estimate that less than 5% of enterprises experimenting with autonomous agents have deployed agentic identity systems — say the reasons for this lack of security hardening are varied.



First, many of these efforts are effectively shadow IT, where a line of business (LOB) executive has authorized the proof of concept to see what these agents can do. In these cases, IT or cyber teams haven’t likely been involved, and so security hasn’t been a top priority for the POC.



Second, many executives — including third-party business partners handling supply chain, distribution, or manufacturing — have historically cut corners for POCs because they are traditionally confined to sandboxes isolated from the enterprise’s live environments. 



But agentic systems don’t work that way. To test their capabilities, they typically need to be released into the general environment. 



The proper way to proceed is for every agent in your environment — whether IT authorized, LOB launched, or that of a third party — to be tracked and controlled by PKI identities from agentic authentication vendors. Extreme defense would include instructing all authorized agents to refuse communication from any agent without full identification. Unfortunately, autonomous agents — like their gen AI cousins — often ignore instructions (aka guardrails). 



“Agentic-friendly encounters conflict with essential security principles. Enterprises cannot risk scenarios where agents autonomously discover each other, establish communication channels, and form transactional relationships,” says Kanwar Preet Singh Sandhu, who tracks cybersecurity strategies for Tata Consultancy Services.



“When IT designs a system, its tasks and objectives should be clearly defined and restricted to those duties,” he adds. “While agent-to-agent encounters are technically possible, they pose serious risks to principles like least privilege and segregation of duties.For structured and planned collaboration or integration, organizations must follow stringent protocols such as MCP [Model Context Protocol] and A2A [Agent to Agent], which were created precisely for this purpose.”



DigiCert’s Sabin says his interactions with enterprises revealed “little to none” creating identities for their autonomous agents. “Definitely less than 10%, probably less than 5%. There is a huge gap in identity.”



Agentic IDs: Putting the genie back in the bottle



Once agentic experiments begin without proper identities established, it’s far more difficult to add identity authentication later, Sabin notes.



“How do we start adding in identity after the fact? They don’t have these processes established. The agent can and will be hijacked, compromised. You have to have a kill switch,” he says. “AI agents’ ability to verify who is issuing a command and whether that human/system has authority is one of the defining security issues of agentic AI.”



To address that issue, CISOs will likely need to rethink identity, authentication, and privilege. 



“What is truly challenging about this is that we are no longer determining how a human authenticates to a system. We are now asked to determine how an autonomous agent determines that the individual providing instructions is legitimate and that the instructions are within the expected pattern of action,” Cisco’s Kale says. “The shift to determining legitimacy based on the autonomous agent’s assessment of the human’s intent, rather than simply identifying the human, introduces a whole new range of risk factors that were never anticipated by traditional authentication methods.”



Ishraq Khan, CEO of coding productivity tool vendor Kodezi, also believes CISOs are likely underestimating the security threats that exist within agentic AI systems.



“Traditional authentication frameworks assume static identities and predictable request patterns. Autonomous agents create a new category of risk because they initiate actions independently, escalate behavior based on memory, and form new communication pathways on their own. The threat surface becomes dynamic, not static,” Khan says. “When agents update their own internal state, learn from prior interactions, or modify their role within a workflow, their identity from a security perspective changes over time. Most organizations are not prepared for agents whose capabilities and behavior evolve after authentication.”



Khan adds: “A compromised agent can impersonate collaboration patterns, fabricate system state or manipulate other agents into cascading failures. This is not simply malware. It is a behavioral attack on decision-making.”



Harish Peri, SVP and general manager of AI Security at Okta, puts it more directly: “This is not just an NHI problem. This is a recipe for disaster. It is a new kind of identity, a new kind of relentless user.”



Regarding the problem of being unable to undo the damage when a hijacked agent gives malicious instructions to legitimate agents, Peri says it can be a challenging problem that no one seems to have solved yet.



“If the risk signal is strong enough, we do have the capability to revoke not just the privilege but the access token,” Peri says. But “the real-time kind of chaining requires more thought.”



Unwinding agent interactions will be a tall order



One issue is that tracking interactions for backward chaining will require a massive amount of data to be captured from every agent in the enterprise environment. And given that autonomous agents act at non-human speed, a data warehouse for that activity will likely fill up quickly.



“By the time the agent does something and identity gets revoked, all of the downstream agents have already interacted with that compromised agent. They have already accepted assignments and have already cued up its next step actions,” Cisco’s Kale explains. “There is no mechanism to propagate that revocation backwards. Kill switches are necessary but they are incomplete.”



The process to go backwards to all contacted agents “sounds like a straightforward script. It looks easy until you try and do it properly,” he says. “You need to know every instruction an agent has issued and the hard part is deciding what to undo” — a scenario Kale likens to alert fatigue. “This could absolutely collapse from its own weight. This could all become noise and not security at that point.”



Jason Soroko, a senior fellow at Sectigo, agrees that backward alerting of impacted agents “is nowhere near to being fully solved at this time.” 



But he argues that agentic cybersecurity has inadvertently painted itself into a corner. 



“A lot of autonomous AI agent authentication will rely on a simple API token to verify itself.  We have inadvertently built a weapon waiting for a stolen shared secret,” Soroko says. “To fix this, we must move beyond shared secrets to cryptographic proof of possession, ensuring the agent verifies the ‘who’ behind the command, not just the ‘concert wristband’ authenticator.”

FCC Bans Foreign-Made Drones and Key Parts Over U.S. National Security Risks,"The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on Monday announced a ban on all drones and critical components made in a foreign country, citing national security concerns.

US bans new foreign-made drones and components,"The Federal Communications Commission has added foreign-made drones and their critical components to the agency’s “Covered List,” making them prohibited to import into the US. In a public notice published by the FCC, it said several national security agencies have determined that umanned aircraft systems (UAS) and their critical components produced in foreign countries pose an unacceptable risk to the national security of the United States. “UAS and UAS critical components must be produced in the United States,” the agency said. “UAS are inherently dual-use: they are both commercial platforms and potentially military or paramilitary sensors and weapons. UAS and UAS critical components, including data transmission devices, communications systems, flight controllers, ground control stations, controllers, navigation systems, batteries, smart batteries, and motors produced in a foreign country could enable persistent surveillance, data exfiltration, and destructive operations over U.S. territory, including over World Cup and Olympic venues and other mass gathering events.”FCC Chair Brendan Carr clarified on X that the ban does not affect old drones. People can continue using the devices they’ve already purchased, and retailers can keep selling models that have already been approved by the agency. The new rule only applies to upcoming models. He also said that the Department of War or the Department of Homeland Security can allow specific new models, a certain class of drones or particular components to be sold in the US. Today, based on an Executive Branch national security determination, the FCC has added foreign-produced UAS (drones) and foreign-produced UAS critical component parts to the FCC’s Covered List on a going forward basis. President Trump has been clear that his Administration will… pic.twitter.com/tVLlsBeOfw— Brendan Carr (@BrendanCarrFCC) December 22, 2025
 

The FCC didn’t name any manufacturers in particular, but one of the most well-known brands that will be affected by the ban is Chinese company DJI, which told Engadget that it was disappointed by the agency’s decision. “While DJI was not singled out, no information has been released regarding what information was used by the Executive Branch in reaching its determination,” a spokesperson said. DJI has long been in the US government’s crosshairs and has been trying to prove that its products aren’t a national security threat.  “DJI products are among the safest and most secure on the market, supported by years of reviews conducted by US government agencies and independent third parties,” they added. “Concerns about DJI’s data security have not been grounded in evidence and instead reflect protectionism, contrary to the principles of an open market.” This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/us-bans-new-foreign-made-drones-and-components-053201854.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2F2025-12%2Fbb46727f-e71c-4a75-96a8-61f2dffb5d72&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=6f1ce0362a3a95ef15cf831952c173d116d62818,https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/us-bans-new-foreign-made-drones-and-components-053201854.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-23T05:32:01Z,8,Tech

Pirate group Anna's Archive says it has scraped Spotify in its entirety,"Anna&#39;s Archive, the open-source search engine for shadow libraries, says it scraped Spotify&#39;s entire library of music. The group acquired metadata for around 256 million tracks, with 86 million actual songs, and is just under 300TB in total size.
&#34;A while ago, we discovered a way to scrape Spotify at scale. We saw a role for us here to build a music archive primarily aimed at preservation,&#34; the group said in a blog post. The pirated treasure trove of music represents over 15 million artists with over 58 million albums.
The group intends to make all files available for download for anyone with the available disk space. &#34;This Spotify scrape is our humble attempt to start such a “preservation archive” for music. Of course Spotify doesn’t have all the music in the world, but it’s a great start,&#34; the group wrote. The 86 million songs that the group has archived so far represent about 99.6 percent of listens on the platform. This only represents about 37 percent of the total and the group still has millions left to be archived.
The open-source site is normally focused on text like books and papers, which it says offers the highest information density. The group says its goal of &#34;preserving humanity&#39;s knowledge and culture&#34; doesn&#39;t distinguish between media types. Of course none of this is exactly legal, and the sharing or downloading of all these files is flagrantly in violation of IP protection laws.
Anna&#39;s Archive contends that current collections of music, both physical and digital, are over-indexed to the most popular artists or composed of unnecessarily large file sizes due to collectors&#39; focus on fidelity. The group says that what it&#39;s amassed is by far the largest music metadata database publicly available. The music files will be released in order of popularity in stages.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/pirate-group-annas-archive-says-it-has-scraped-spotify-in-its-entirety-211914755.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-10%2F59b996a0-b18f-11f0-a9bf-8f5d1e90d2ca&resize=1400%2C915&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=d30937a9d972ce40c15a80c5c4da22453771548a,https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/pirate-group-annas-archive-says-it-has-scraped-spotify-in-its-entirety-211914755.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-22T21:19:14Z,7,Tech

The Indie Game Awards snatches back two trophies from Clair Obscur over its use of generative AI,"The Indie Game Awards has stripped Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 of two major awards, including Game of the Year and Debut Game. This is due to developer Sandfall Interactive&#39;s use of generative AI, as reported by Mashable.
This looks to be fairly cut and dry. The awards ceremony clearly states in its FAQ that any game that uses generative AI in the development process would be &#34;strictly ineligible&#34; for nominations. It was recently revealed that Sandfall did indeed use generative AI while making Clair Obscur.
Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but it appears as though Clair Obscure: Expedition 33 used generative AI for these textures. pic.twitter.com/V6mtdG8bUx— Nyanomancer (@nyanomancer) April 26, 2025
 


The company says it was only for placeholder textures that were later removed, but a few squeezed past the QA process and made their way to the final game and, as such, the internet. The Indie Game Awards is clear about disallowing any use of generative AI and, so, here we are.
&#34;In light of Sandfall Interactive confirming the use of gen AI art in production on the day of the Indie Game Awards 2025 premiere, this does disqualify Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 from its nomination,&#34; the organization wrote. &#34;While the assets in question were patched out and it is a wonderful game, it does go against the regulations we have in place.&#34;
Six One Indie, the company behind the ceremony, deserves a smidge of the blame here. These awards were initially handed out last week and we&#39;ve known about the whole Clair Obscur AI thing for months. It says it didn&#39;t discover Sandfall&#39;s use of AI until December 18, the day the winners were announced. A Google search on December 17 likely would&#39;ve helped. It is worth noting, however, that Sandfall did previously agree that no generative AI was used during development as part of the submission process. 
In any event, the second-highest scoring titles in each category now gets the award. This means that Blue Prince is now Game of the Year and Sorry We&#39;re Closed snags Debut Game.

Despite this AI controversy, Clair Obscur had a record-setting night at this month&#39;s The Game Awards. It won just about everything it was put up for, including Game of the Year. It also made our list of the best games of 2025. The developer announced that it had sold 5 million copies back in October. That number is surely much higher by now.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-indie-game-awards-snatches-back-two-trophies-from-clair-obscur-over-its-use-of-generative-ai-164730842.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F7d0901e0-df52-11f0-b773-fb34bae0b8fa&resize=1400%2C784&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=27882486020ff79f13f33ec6c03356fc60d7afc8,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-indie-game-awards-snatches-back-two-trophies-from-clair-obscur-over-its-use-of-generative-ai-164730842.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-22T16:47:30Z,7,Tech

Scammers use AI to make fake art seem real,"
		
					  
						




Fraudsters have started using AI to create fake documents claiming that artworks are genuine or legally owned, the Financial Times reports. According to art insurance brokers at Marsh, chatbots and big language models are being used to forge invoices, appraisal certificates and certificates of authenticity.



In other cases, it has not been a case of deliberate fraud, but rather AI hallucinating false references to a work of art, which the owner has taken to be true.



False documents are nothing new in the art world, but AI has made them more realistic and harder to detect.



“AI makes something that’s been going on for a long time a little easier and a little faster. You don’t have to invent a professorial expert anymore — you can just let the AI do it for you,” Harry Smith of art valuation firm Gurr Johns told the Financial Times.



To counter this trend, both insurers and appraisers are now trying to use AI themselves to review metadata and identify manipulation.

"Uber allows violent felons to drive on its platform, investigation finds","An investigation by the New York Times into Uber&#39;s background checks and safety procedures for its drivers found a patchwork approach that opens the door for violent felons to drive for the ride-hailing platform.
Uber outright rejects applicants convicted of murder, sexual assault, kidnapping and terrorism. However, in 22 states, the Times found Uber can approve applicants convicted of many other offenses including child abuse, assault and stalking, if the convictions are at least seven years old. The extensive investigation also found that in 35 states, these checks are based largely on where someone has lived in those seven years, meaning convictions from other locations could be missed.
In 2017, Massachusetts conducted an audit of ride-hailing drivers in the state and ended up banning more than 8,000 drivers (about 11 percent) who were previously approved. Lyft, for its part, does not allow drivers with previous violent felony convictions regardless of how long ago the conviction was.
In a document from 2015 reviewed by the Times, Uber executives discussed a strategy to &#34;shift the conversation about safety from background checks to [less costly] initiatives proven to reduce incidents.&#34; A 2018 email from Uber’s then head of safety communications described the company&#39;s background check policy as &#34;a bare minimum.&#34;
The Times compiled half a dozen examples of serious cases where Uber drivers with past violent convictions were later accused by passengers of sexual assault or rape. Two of those cases resulted in criminal convictions.
Between 2017 and 2022, Uber&#39;s US operations received a report of sexual assault or sexual misconduct among almost every eight minutes, according to the company&#39;s own internal data. Uber said 75 percent of these reports were for &#34;less serious&#34; incidents such as flirting or making comments about a rider&#39;s appearance, and claimed that 99.9 percent of its rides take place without incident.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/uber-allows-violent-felons-to-drive-on-its-platform-investigation-finds-162721155.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2024-10%2Fd48745e0-87ff-11ef-9fe3-601a06357aaf&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=599292257034f69f834ab25d374ab33aefe4f7c9,https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/uber-allows-violent-felons-to-drive-on-its-platform-investigation-finds-162721155.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-22T16:27:21Z,8,Tech

Pirate activists have copied Spotify’s entire music library,"
		
					  
						




A collective of pirate activists say they gained access to 256 million rows of metadata and 86 million audio files, equivalent to around 300 terabytes of data, from Spotify, Billboard reports.



The metadata, but no audio files, has been made publicly available through the open search engine Anna’s Archive.



Anna’s Archive describes the project as an effort to “preserve the knowledge and culture of humanity” by creating a music archive for preservation purposes.



Spotify itself has confirmed that it is investigating a breach in which a third party allegedly data scraped public metadata and unauthorizedly circumvented DRM protection to access certain audio files.

Paramount has an updated Warner Bros. Discovery bid,"Paramount Skydance isn&#39;t giving up on obtaining Warner Bros. Discovery just yet. The company has amended its $108 billion offer to include Larry Ellison&#39;s &#34;irrevocable personal guarantee&#34; equaling $40.4 billion. Ellison is the founder or Oracle and a backer of Skydance, created by his son David Ellison, Paramount Skydance&#39;s CEO. 
On December 17, WBD formally recommended shareholders reject Paramount&#39;s offer. WBD had already accepted an $82.7 billion offer from Netflix, set to close some time next year following regulatory approval. &#34;[The board] has unanimously determined that the tender offer launched by Paramount Skydance on December 8, 2025 is not in the best interests of WBD and its shareholders and does not meet the criteria of a &#39;Superior Proposal&#39; under the terms of WBD&#39;s merger agreement with Netflix announced on December 5, 2025,&#34; WBD stated. 
The Paramount deal included backing by sovereign wealth funds in places like Saudi Arabia and Qatar. But the Ellisons previously said that, if the other funders dropped out, they would &#34;backstop the full amount of the bid.&#34; That wasn&#39;t enough of a guarantee for WBD. 
Now, Paramount has returned with the irrevocable personal guarantee and an agreement that the senior Ellison won&#39;t &#34;revoke&#34; or &#34;adversely transfer&#34; the Ellison family trust&#39;s assets while the transaction is pending. WBD had stated that a personal guarantee was the only fix to Paramount&#39;s inadequate offer. 
Paramount might have taken this step, but not with a smile on its face: &#34;None of these concerns, nor the demand for a personal guarantee, were raised by WBD or its advisors to Paramount in the 12-week period leading up to WBD agreeing to the inferior transaction with Netflix, Inc.,&#34; the company stated about its updated offer. 
&#34;Our $30 per share, fully financed all-cash offer was on December 4th, and continues to be, the superior option to maximize value for WBD shareholders. Because of our commitment to investment and growth, our acquisition will be superior for all WBD stakeholders, as a catalyst for greater content production, greater theatrical output, and more consumer choice,&#34; David Ellison stated. &#34;We expect the board of directors of WBD to take the necessary steps to secure this value-enhancing transaction and preserve and strengthen an iconic Hollywood treasure for the future.&#34;
Paramount&#39;s updated offer also includes publishing the trust&#39;s assets, more flexible transaction terms and an increase from $5 billion to $5.8 billion of its &#34;regulatory reverse termination fee&#34; — in line with Netflix&#39;s. 
Paramount&#39;s offer will expire on January 21, 2026. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/paramount-has-an-updated-warner-bros-discovery-bid-144348321.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2Fbbfffbe0-db44-11f0-aefe-d354d1d6386d&resize=1400%2C783&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=f5fcb045a564c3dbe59f20fccec65be7db08aa9a,https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/paramount-has-an-updated-warner-bros-discovery-bid-144348321.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-22T14:43:48Z,11,Tech

Instacart is ending its controversial price tests,"Instacart has announced it will be ending price testing on its platform. This comes after a study published earlier this month revealed pricing experiments that led to some customers seeing higher prices than others and the FTC saying last week it would be investigating the grocery delivery app.
&#34;Effective immediately, Instacart is ending all item price tests on our platform. Retailers will no longer be able to use Eversight technology to run item price tests on Instacart,&#34; an Instacart spokesperson shared with Engadget. The blog post called out &#34;misconceptions and misinformation,&#34; maintaining that these price experiments were never the result of dynamic pricing and were never based on any personal or behavioral information about shoppers.
In an earlier blog post responding to the study&#39;s allegations, Instacart said pricing changes were a &#34;form of short-term, randomized A/B testing.&#34; The post referred to this process as &#34;common in the grocery industry&#34; and continued to paint the practice as a way to &#34;invest in lower prices.&#34; It also highlighted that Instacart does not set the prices on its platform, which are set by retailers listed on the app.
The company made clear that its retail partners will continue to set their own prices on the platform, which may vary by location just as they do in brick-and-mortar stores, but that Instacart will no longer support any item price testing services.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/instacart-is-ending-its-controversial-price-tests-134552152.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2022-04%2Fd167fc90-b4eb-11ec-a73e-4973ffee4825&resize=1400%2C835&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=a527cf41d4ea4d3a83893f75bd32ecf11ddd7512,https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/instacart-is-ending-its-controversial-price-tests-134552152.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-22T13:45:52Z,7,Tech

Here’s how to connect the Switch 2 Pro Controller, how to sync additional Bluetooth controllers and what to do if something doesn’t pair correctly.Before you start: What you’ll needTo pair any controller with the Switch 2 you’ll need the console powered on and updated to the latest system software. Navigate to System Settings, System then System Update to check. It also helps to have the controller charged, since some models need enough battery to begin pairing.On the Switch 2, all controller settings reside in the Controllers &amp; Sensors section of System Settings. You can pair up to four controllers depending on the game and the controller type.How to pair the Switch 2 Pro ControllerNintendo’s Switch 2 Pro Controller is the simplest device to connect, and it can be paired in two different ways: wired and wireless. If you’re setting it up for the first time, the wired method is the fastest and most reliable.To pair the Switch 2 Pro Controller using a USB cable:Connect the Pro Controller to the Switch 2 using a USB-C cable.Wake the console and open the Controllers menu from the Home screen.The console will automatically detect the controller and pair it.Once the controller is paired, you can unplug the cable and continue using it wirelessly. This method ensures an instant connection and is useful if the controller has low battery.To pair wirelessly:Turn on the Switch 2 and navigate to System Settings, Controllers &amp; Sensors then Change Grip/Order.Press and hold the small Sync button on top of the Pro Controller until the indicator lights begin flashing.The Switch 2 will detect the controller and confirm the pairing.How to pair other Bluetooth controllers to Switch 2The Switch 2 supports a wide range of Bluetooth controllers, including many gamepads designed for PC, Android and iOS devices. Pairing these controllers uses a similar process, but you’ll start by putting the controller into Bluetooth pairing mode.Each controller handles this differently. On most models, you’ll hold a dedicated sync button or press a combination of buttons until lights begin flashing. If you’re not sure which buttons to press, check the controller’s manual.On the Switch 2, navigate to the Home Menu and select Controllers then Change Grip/Order. This page is always used for wireless pairing. The console will search for available Bluetooth devices as soon as it opens.Once your controller appears on the screen, select it to finish the pairing process. The lights on the controller should stop blinking and settle into an assigned player slot. Some controllers may prompt you to confirm the button layout or adjust settings after pairing.The Switch 2 can use up to four wireless controllers at once. For local multiplayer games, each controller will automatically be assigned a player number once connected.Troubleshooting pairing issuesIf your controller doesn’t appear in the pairing menu, make sure Bluetooth is enabled on the Switch 2 by navigating to System Settings then Controllers &amp; Sensors. It’s also worth restarting the controller and checking that it has enough battery to stay in pairing mode. Moving closer to the console can help reduce interference as well. If you’re trying to connect a controller that supports multiple device profiles, verify that it’s set to Nintendo Switch mode or a standard Bluetooth gamepad mode.With Pro Controllers, a wired connection usually solves pairing problems. Plug the controller into the Switch 2 using a USB-C cable and allow it to sync before trying wireless mode again.Reconnecting paired controllersOnce you’ve paired a controller, reconnecting it is as simple as pressing any button. The Switch 2 will wake and recognize it automatically as long as the controller is still linked to the console. If you pair the controller with another device later, you may need to repeat the pairing process.Pairing controllers with the Switch 2 is quick once you know where the settings live. The Pro Controller offers the most seamless experience, especially if you start with a wired connection, but the console’s Bluetooth support gives you plenty of flexibility for multiplayer games or different play styles.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/how-to-pair-controllers-with-the-nintendo-switch-2-130000126.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2F4999b390-4862-11f0-bd7f-b1af7190905b_2164.jpeg&resize=1400%2C846&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=f75773bc3b7c9df5a5a7859779fc3c6acbc97beb,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/how-to-pair-controllers-with-the-nintendo-switch-2-130000126.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-22T13:00:00Z,9,Tech
Foldable phone makers have solved every issue except one,"It might be hard to believe, but foldable phones have already been around for the better part of a decade. Granted, the first one I saw back in 2019 — which actually predates Samsung&#39;s Galaxy Fold — was a cobbled-together mess. But since then, phone makers have been steadily iterating and tweaking their designs, and this year,  manufacturers have finally addressed all the major issues about foldable phones except one: price.Let’s go back to the OG Fold. Even though it was chunky and heavy, had a tiny exterior display and suffered from a hinge that let too much detritus inside (which is probably how The Verge’s review unit got wrecked), it still showed so much promise. It was a true multitasker — a phone that could turn into a small tablet at a moment&#39;s notice. What&#39;s not to like?This scene would have sent shivers down my spine in previous years, but thanks to an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold isn&#39;t bothered. Sam Rutherford for EngadgetFrom there, Samsung upgraded its foldables with water resistance and S Pen support on the Z Fold 3, followed by eliminating the gap between the two halves of a closed Z Fold 5. And as competition grew from OnePlus and Google (not to mention all the Chinese rivals like Oppo, Xiaomi and others), we saw design and software improvement across the category . In 2025, two phones in particular brought major upgrades to foldables as a whole. Even though its shape didn&#39;t change much from its predecessor, Google managed to get the Pixel 10 Pro Fold an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance — finally putting protection for both dirt and liquid in the same foldable for the first time. Now, for all the folks out there with regular phones, that might not sound like a big deal. But on devices with complicated hinges where you really don&#39;t want random garbage getting inside, that&#39;s a massive relief and a big improvement to the handset&#39;s general usability. If you only look at their dimensions, you&#39;d be hard pressed to tell the difference between the Galaxy Z Fold 7 (right) and an S25 Ultra (left).Sam Rutherford for EngadgetMeanwhile, with the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Samsung achieved what may be an even bigger accomplishment by creating a foldable phone that was essentially the same size and weight as a traditional glass brick handset — with a massive 8-inch interior display no less. In fact, if you compared the Z Fold 7 to Samsung&#39;s other flagship — the S25 Ultra — the fold is actually a touch lighter (7.58 ounces vs 7.69 ounces) and practically just as thin (8.9mm vs 8.2mm). That&#39;s huge because one of the biggest issues with previous generations of foldables was excess bulk and heft, to the point where often I had to wear a belt just so my pants wouldn&#39;t sag when carrying one around. Unfortunately, there isn&#39;t a phone maker that has put both of these advancements into a single gadget just yet. But this is still a big deal, and based on how things are trending, I&#39;m sure that won&#39;t be the case for long.What about the crease, you say? Yes, even the latest and greatest foldables still have a small depression that runs down the screen where the phone bends in half. Let me be clear: that&#39;s not really an issue. Sure, it would be nice if it weren&#39;t there, but getting mad about the crease is kind of like being annoyed at a convertible car that has some extra panel gaps because it has a retractable roof. Not only is the crease basically invisible when you are looking at it head-on (which is the vast majority of the time), in reality, people don&#39;t touch the dead center of their phone&#39;s display all that often — especially on a screen the size of a small tablet.The Z Fold 7 has made bulky foldables a thing of the past while the Pixel 10 Pro Fold shows how these phones don&#39;t need to be afraid of dirt anymore. Sam Rutherford for EngadgetReally, the one thing the makers of big foldables haven&#39;t figured out is how to make them affordable. OnePlus sort of came close in 2023 with the Open, which cost $1,500 after rebates that included trading in literally any phone (even broken ones). In fact, things are actually kind of going backwards. The launch price of the Z Fold 7 ($2,000) is $200 more than what the Z Fold 5 debuted at just a couple of years ago. Even with high prices, I&#39;ve started seeing more and more foldable phones in the wild than ever before and the data backs up my sentiment. Sales of the Galaxy Z Fold 7 are up 50 percent compared to the previous generation while global foldable phone sales reached a new high in Q3 of this year, and I&#39;m willing to bet that there are millions of others out there who would be interested in them — if only they didn&#39;t cost so much. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/foldable-phone-makers-have-solved-every-issue-except-one-130000891.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2Ffoldables-in-2025-lead.jpg&resize=1400%2C840&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=86dc1c88bb7d90af3d2db3865d52fdaf53c62951,https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/foldable-phone-makers-have-solved-every-issue-except-one-130000891.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-22T13:00:00Z,9,Tech
Think you can beat ransomware? RansomHouse just made it a lot harder,"
		
					  
						




A recent upgrade to the RansomHouse ransomware operation has added new concerns for enterprise defenders, introducing a multi-layered encryption update to the group’s double-extortion RaaS model.



Also tracked under the cluster Jolly Scorpius, the ransomware gang has transitioned from a simple, single-phase encryption routine to a multi-layered dual-key encryption architecture that increases the complexity of its extortion operations.



Detailed by Palo Alto Networks’ threat intelligence team, the update raises the bar for recovery once systems are compromised. The change affects how files are processed and encrypted during an attack, complicating analysis and limiting defenders’ ability to recover data without paying a ransom.



“The upgrade in encryption used by RansomHouse RaaS, going from a simple linear model to a more complex multi-layered approach, signals a concerning trajectory in ransomware development,” Unit42 researchers said in a blog post. “This demonstrates how threat actors are updating their techniques to enhance effectiveness.”



Researchers described the scale of RansomHouse’s operations as “significant”, with at least 123 victims listed on its data leak site spanning healthcare, finance, transportation, and government.



VMware ESXi-tuned encryption upgrade



The researchers confirmed that RansomHouse is moving away from a linear encryption model toward a multi-stage, dual-key process, which materially complicates decryption or key recovery. They tracked the updated encryptor under the name “Mario,” describing it as the ransomware component for the newly introduced multi-layered process.



In Unit42’s reverse engineering of Mario, analysts observed that the upgraded binary generates both a 32-byte primary and an 8-byte secondary encryption key, executing separate encryption passes that interlock.



For enterprises running virtual infrastructure, particularly VMware ESXi hosts, this development represents a pivot toward higher-impact compromise. RansomHouse’s tools specifically target ESXi files and backups, encrypting them with the “e.mario” extension while dropping ransom instructions for payment.



Combined with MrAgent, RansomHouse’s deployment and persistence utility, the RaaS framework impairs both operational continuity and recovery efforts, the researchers noted.



RansomHouse attempts double extortion



Beyond the cryptographic update, RansomHouse leverages a double extortion model, which involves exfiltrating data and threatening public disclosure in addition to encrypting it, to add pressure on victims to pay.



This layered pressure tactic, already a common feature of modern ransomware attacks, complicates incident response timelines and negotiating strategies for corporate security teams.



Unit 42’s disclosure also revealed that RansomHouse operates with a modular attack chain separating operators (tool developers and leak managers) from attackers/affiliates (those who gain access and deploy the ransomware). This model allows the RaaS to scale and adapt, even as individual affiliates rotate or rebrand.



The disclosure noted that detection strategies that rely solely on static signatures are increasingly insufficient against ransomware like RansmHouse that use dynamic, chunked encryption with multi-phase execution. Investing in behavioral analytics, real-time monitoring, hardened segmentation, and regular backup validation remains essential. Unit 42 has published indicators of compromise (file hashes, file extensions, and ransom note artifacts) tied to the updated RansomHouse tooling, urging enterprises to proactively hunt for related activity across affected endpoints and virtualized environments.

Waymo vehicles are operating again in San Francisco following a power outage,"Waymo has resumed its robo-taxi service in San Francisco after a power outage stranded vehicles around the city, CNBC reported. The blackout, caused by a Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PG&amp;E) substation fire, caused traffic light disruptions that affected Waymo&#39;s automated driving systems. 
&#34;Yesterday’s power outage was a widespread event that caused gridlock across San Francisco, with non-functioning traffic signals and transit disruptions,&#34; a Waymo spokesperson told CNBC in a statement. &#34;While the failure of the utility infrastructure was significant, we are committed to ensuring our technology adjusts to traffic flow during such events.&#34;
Following the outage, which began at around 1:09 PM Saturday and peaked around two hours later, Waymo responded by suspending its ride-hailing services in the city. However, images and videos on social media showed the autonomous taxis stopped at intersections with hazard lights on.
The company blamed its disruption on the size of the outage. &#34;While the Waymo Driver [automated system] is designed to treat non-functional signals as four-way stops, the sheer scale of the outage led to instances where vehicles remained stationary longer than usual to confirm the state of the affected intersections. This contributed to traffic friction during the height of the congestion,&#34; the spokesperson explained, adding that Waymo&#39;s actions were &#34;closely coordinated with San Francisco city officials.&#34; 
Still, the service disruption is a black mark for Waymo, as the sudden halt in service exacerbated traffic problems caused by the blackout. Elon Musk bragged on X that Tesla, Waymo&#39;s latest robo-taxi rival in the city, was &#34;unaffected&#34; by the power outage. However, Tesla&#39;s ride-hailing service is not yet fully autonomous and requires a human driver behind the wheel at all times. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/waymo-vehicles-are-operating-again-in-san-francisco-following-a-power-outage-112924838.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F8e517d80-df23-11f0-a77d-627b529fdc4b&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=5016ae5d1ceb2bd72a3f1df1fc5f705c442d21ef,https://www.engadget.com/transportation/waymo-vehicles-are-operating-again-in-san-francisco-following-a-power-outage-112924838.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-22T11:29:24Z,7,Tech
Hackers exploit Microsoft OAuth device codes to hijack enterprise accounts,"
		
					  
						




Cybercriminals and state-sponsored hackers are increasingly exploiting Microsoft’s legitimate OAuth 2.0 device authorization process to hijack enterprise accounts, bypassing multifactor authentication protections and gaining persistent access to sensitive organizational data, a report said.



Researchers at Proofpoint tracked multiple threat clusters — both financially motivated and state-aligned — that were using device code phishing techniques to trick users into granting unauthorized access to their Microsoft 365 accounts. The campaigns have surged since September 2025, representing a significant shift from limited, targeted attacks to widespread exploitation.



“While this is not necessarily a novel technique, it is notable to see it used increasingly by multiple threat clusters,” the Proofpoint Threat Research Team wrote in a blog post.



The tactic represents an evolution of techniques that financially motivated groups used earlier this year to breach Salesforce environments at Google, Qantas, and luxury brands through similar OAuth abuse, affecting hundreds of organizations. Those Salesforce attacks, which began in June 2025, used voice phishing. The current wave drops the phone calls for email-based social engineering, making attacks easier to scale.



A legitimate process turned malicious



The attacks abuse OAuth’s device authorization flow, which was designed for authenticating on input-constrained devices like smart TVs and IoT devices. Threat actors, according to the blog post, initiate the legitimate Microsoft device authorization process, then trick victims into entering the generated device code — disguised as a one-time password — at Microsoft’s own verification URL.



“The lures typically claim that the device code is an OTP and direct the user to input the code at Microsoft’s verification URL,” the researchers wrote. “Once the user inputs the code, the original token is validated, giving the threat actor access to the targeted M365 account.”



Successful attacks enable account takeover, data exfiltration, lateral movement within networks, and establishment of persistent access to corporate resources. In some cases, stolen data becomes the basis for extortion attempts, as ShinyHunters demonstrated in its Salesforce campaigns.



Tools of the trade



What’s driving the surge is the availability of tools that make these attacks easy to execute. Proofpoint identified two primary kits: SquarePhish2 and Graphish.



SquarePhish2 is an updated version of a tool originally published by Dell Secureworks in 2022. It automates the OAuth Device Grant Authorization flow and integrates QR code functionality.



The Graphish phishing kit, shared on vetted criminal hacking forums, enables the creation of convincing phishing pages leveraging Azure App Registrations and adversary-in-the-middle attack capabilities. “The tool is designed to be user-friendly and does not require advanced technical expertise, lowering the barrier for entry and enabling even low-skilled threat actors to conduct sophisticated phishing campaigns,” the Proofpoint researchers wrote in the blog.



These tools help attackers overcome a key limitation: device codes are typically short-lived. The automation enables larger-scale campaigns than were previously possible.



State actors join cybercriminals



Since January 2025, Proofpoint has tracked multiple state-aligned threat actors abusing OAuth device code authorization for account takeover, representing a concerning evolution in espionage tradecraft.



“This technique has been most widely used by Russia-aligned threat actors,” the researchers noted, citing prior reporting by security firm Volexity. Proofpoint also observed suspected China-aligned activity and other unattributed espionage campaigns.



One group, Proofpoint tracks as UNK_AcademicFlare, has been conducting device code phishing since at least September 2025. The suspected Russia-aligned actor uses compromised email addresses from government and military organizations to target entities in government, think tanks, higher education, and transportation sectors across the US and Europe.



UNK_AcademicFlare typically conducts patient rapport building via benign outreach before launching device code phishing attempts. The group uses compromised accounts to arrange fictitious meetings or interviews, then shares malicious links to Cloudflare Worker URLs spoofing OneDrive accounts.



Volexity researchers documented similar tactics in recent campaigns where Russian actors created fake websites masquerading as legitimate European security conferences to trick attendees into granting OAuth access.



Widespread campaigns target financial lures



Financially motivated threat actors have also embraced device code phishing. Proofpoint highlighted activity from TA2723, a high-volume credential phishing actor known for campaigns spoofing Microsoft OneDrive, LinkedIn, and DocuSign.



Beginning in October 2025, TA2723 launched campaigns using salary and benefits-themed lures. One campaign used email messages purporting to contain documents titled “OCTOBER_SALARY_AMENDED” and “Salary Bonus + Employer Benefits Reports 25.”



The messages directed recipients to URLs that ultimately led to device code authorization pages where victims were tricked into generating and entering one-time passcodes. Proofpoint researchers suspect TA2723 used both SquarePhish2 and Graphish tools across different campaign waves.



The 2025 ShinyHunters campaign demonstrated the potential damage. In a separate but related OAuth abuse incident, threat actors exploited OAuth tokens stolen from the Salesloft/Drift integration to access Salesforce instances at hundreds of organizations. Companies, including Cloudflare, Zscaler, and Tenable, publicly disclosed unauthorized access to data, triggering breach notification requirements.



Proofpoint recommended organizations create Conditional Access policies to block device code flow entirely or implement allow-lists for approved users and IP ranges. “Traditional phishing awareness often emphasizes checking URLs for legitimacy. This approach does not effectively address device code phishing, where users are prompted to enter a device code on the trusted Microsoft portal,” the researchers wrote.



Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment on the findings.

The best cheap laptops of 2026 

  

  

  

  
What to look for in a budget laptop 
First, we at Engadget consider anything under $1,000 to be “budget” in the laptop space. The reason for this is twofold: even the most affordable flagship laptops typically start at $1,000 or more, and if you go dramatically lower than that (say, $500 or less), that’s where you’ll really start to see compromises in performance. You’ll typically find the best cheap laptops striking a good balance between power and price in the $500 to $1,000 range. But in this guide, we’ll cover top picks at a wide range of prices — there are a number of excellent options on the low and high end of the budget spectrum. 
Arguably the biggest thing to look for in a cheap laptop is build quality and a decent spec sheet. You might be able to find configuration options with the latest generation CPU chipsets, or you may have to go for one that has a slightly older processor. We recommend looking for models with solid state drive (SSD) storage instead of a traditional hard drive, as SSDs provide faster performance. And if you can find a PC with the latest internals, it’s worth the investment. However, going with a CPU that’s just one generation behind likely won’t make a noticeable difference in performance. 
Along with processors, you should also consider the amount of memory and storage you need in a daily driver. For the former, we recommend laptops with at least 8GB of RAM; anything with less than that will have a hard time multitasking and managing all those web browsing tabs. The latter is a bit more personal: how much onboard storage you need really depends on how many apps, files, photos, documents and more you will save locally. As a general rule of thumb, try to go for a laptop that has at least a 256GB SSD (this only goes for macOS and Windows machines, as Chromebooks are a bit different). That should give you enough space for programs and files, plus room for future operating system updates. And if you need a machine for light productivity or Android emulation, some laptops even support Android apps natively, which can add extra versatility. 
After determining the best performance you can get while sticking to your budget, it’s also worth examining a few different design aspects. We recommend a laptop with an IPS display for better viewing angles and color accuracy, though premium models with OLED displays are becoming more common and can offer deeper blacks and vibrant colors. Pay attention to port selection, too — many budget models offer plenty of ports, while higher-end ones tend to prioritize minimalism with fewer connections. If connectivity matters to you, look for options with USB-C, USB-A, HDMI and an audio jack. 
And speaking of practical features, keep an eye on GPU performance if you&#39;re shopping for a budget-friendly gaming laptop. While integrated graphics are fine for casual users, a dedicated GPU will improve gaming and creative workloads. We also recommend checking the refresh rate of the screen, as a higher rate will make a noticeable difference in both games and scrolling-heavy apps. 
A note about refurbished laptops 
Refurbished laptops are another option to consider if you need a new machine and don’t want to spend a ton of money. Buying refurbished tech can be tricky if you’re unfamiliar with a brand’s or merchant’s policies surrounding what they classify as “refurbished.” But it’s not impossible — for laptops, we recommend going directly to the manufacturer for refurbished devices. Apple, Dell and Microsoft all have official refurbishment processes that their devices go through before they’re put back on the market that verifies the machines work properly and are in good condition. Third-party retailers like Amazon and Walmart also have their own refurbishment programs for laptops and other gadgets as well.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-budget-laptop-150038435.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F78df2110-d44b-11f0-b7fb-05b74b6687fa&resize=1400%2C840&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=1bc4180bd03fedd9ed3f2625014ee4af0e3a92e2,https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-budget-laptop-150038435.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-22T10:01:26Z,9,Tech

What CISOs should know about the SolarWinds lawsuit dismissal,"
		
					  
						




The US Securities and Exchange Commission’s Nov. 30 decision to dismiss its lawsuit against SolarWinds and its CISO, Tim Brown, was met with immediate and widespread joy across the cybersecurity leadership community.



For many CISOs, the dismissal landed not as an abstract legal development, but as something deeply personal. “Thank God,” Gadi Evron, CEO and founder of Knostic and CISO in Residence for AI at the Cloud Security Alliance, said when he learned of the dismissal. “People are feeling relieved, and there is a sense of community and celebrating together,” he tells CSO.



“I breathed a sigh of relief,” Diana Kelley, CISO of Noma Security, tells CSO. After five years of investigation, litigation, and public scrutiny, “I think a lot of CISOs [let out a collective exhale] around this case,” she adds.



That collective sense of relief, however, should not be mistaken for closure. Experts emphasize that the case did not erase the personal and professional risks of being a CISO, nor did it resolve the deeper structural tension it exposed. Security leaders are still held publicly accountable for cyber failures while lacking full authority over budgets, disclosures, and enterprise risk decisions.



Even though the SolarWinds case sparked a deeper recognition that cybersecurity responsibility should be a shared responsibility across enterprises, shifting policy priorities and future administrations could once again put CISOs in the SEC’s crosshairs, they warn.



In the meantime, the legal saga of Tim Brown — along with the federal conviction of former Uber CISO Joe Sullivan in 2022 — highlights critical steps CISOs can take to protect themselves and their organizations before any similar litigation arises in the future.



Overview of the case: From Russian hackers to dismissal



To understand why the SolarWinds case sent such a chill through the CISO community, and why its dismissal matters, a recap of how the breach unfolded and how the SEC framed its claims is useful.



Beginning in 2019 and continuing through November 2020, threat actors — widely believed to be the threat group known as APT20 or Cozy Bear, part of Russia’s foreign intelligence service or SVR — compromised the Orion IT management solution sold by SolarWinds by inserting malicious code into a legitimate software update.



Using malware called SUNBURST, the attackers installed a backdoor that affected roughly 18,000 customers, although a much smaller subset was selectively exploited, including multiple US government agencies and major companies.



Years after the technical compromise itself, the fallout took a more personal turn. Amid a streak of other publicly alarming, high-profile breaches in the US, on Oct. 30, 2023, the US Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil action against SolarWinds and — to the shock of many — its CISO, Brown, alleging fraud and internal control failures relating to allegedly known cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities.



The lawsuit claimed that SolarWinds and Brown defrauded investors by overstating SolarWinds’ cybersecurity practices and understating or failing to disclose known risks. On July 18, 2024, federal judge Paul Engelmayer dismissed most of the lawsuit’s claims.



“He basically dismissed all the charges in terms of post-incident activity and said it is easy to be a Monday morning quarterback, but you’re going to have to prove that they really did something intentionally misleading,” Sullivan, who is also a former federal prosecutor and is now CEO of Joe Sullivan Security, tells CSO.



The remaining claims focused on Brown and the degree to which cybersecurity statements posted on SolarWinds’ website before the incident were appropriate in terms of advising customers of their risks. “The judge really focused on that one publication on the company’s website that went into some specificity about what the company does from a cybersecurity perspective and got frankly fairly granular as far as these things go,” Cara Peterman, partner with Alston &amp; Bird’s Securities Litigation Group, tells CSO.



The judge’s reasoning reassured many security leaders, but it also exposed a more profound discomfort about how accountability is assigned inside modern organizations. “The area that a lot of us were really uncomfortable about was the idea that an operational head of security could be personally responsible for what the company says about its cybersecurity investments,” Sullivan says.



He adds, “Tim didn’t have the CISO title before the incident. And so there was just a lot there that made security people very concerned. Why is this operational person on the hook for representations?”



But even if he had had the CISO role before the incident, the argument still holds, according to Sullivan. “Historically, the person who had that title wasn’t a quote-unquote ‘chief’ in the sense that they’re not in the little room of people who run the company,” Sullivan says. “They don’t report to the CEO; they don’t get a huge budget.”



Perhaps in recognition of this fact, and after settlement talks among the SEC, SolarWinds, and Brown, the securities regulator dropped its suit.



In a statement, company CEO Sudhakar Ramakrishna said, “We said from the beginning — and demonstrated during the litigation — the claims were unfounded, and we are happy the SEC has finally decided to abandon them. We stood firmly with our CISO, Tim Brown, and this decision affirms our belief that our team acted with integrity throughout.” SolarWinds has kept Brown on as CISO and paid for his legal representation.



Responsibility without authority is the real risk



At the heart of the SolarWinds lawsuit was a familiar problem for security leaders: responsibility without authority. The dynamic that caught Tim Brown in the SEC’s jaws is that, despite his experience, seniority, and title, he, like most CISOs, carries tremendous responsibility without any real organizational authority to back him up — with concerns around personal liability in the face of that further souring many CISOs on the role.



“We have a lot of the responsibility and very little of the authority,” Knostic’s Evron says. “The organization manages the risk. Our job is to present the risk and to manage the risk once the organization decides what risk to take.”



“We work in a larger ecosystem,” Noma Security’s Kelley adds. “We are not all-powerful. We cannot make all decisions in a company. We must work within the budget. We can advocate for a budget, but then the budget is decided collaboratively by the business. The same with our resources for headcount, or decisions on what is allowed or what’s not allowed in terms of new controls or new policies.”



However, since the lawsuits against Sullivan and Brown first emerged, CEOs and other high-ranking decision-makers have increasingly come under more pressure to accept some of the cyber incident legal liabilities that have often been the sole province of CISOs.



“In my case, at my sentencing hearing, the judge turned to the prosecutor and repeatedly asked, ‘Why isn’t the CEO charged?’” Sullivan says. “The judge literally said, ‘As far as I’m concerned, the CEO is at least as culpable, if not more, as anyone else inside the company when it comes to the situation.’”



Sullivan adds, “In Australia, in the Qantas case, the board took away the bonuses for the CEO and a bunch of others. In one of those DOJ civil cyber fraud cases, the Aero Turbine case, they pierced the corporate veil and went after the private equity firm as well. There is a growing recognition inside government enforcement authorities that if you want to change corporate behavior, you’ve got to aim a little higher than the CISO.”



How CISOs should protect themselves



If the SolarWinds case clarified anything, it’s that relief is temporary and preparation is essential. CISOs have a window of opportunity to shore up their organizational and personal defenses in the event the political pendulum swings and makes CISOs litigation targets again.



“I feel that the SEC staff over the past five to ten years has become more educated and has a more in-depth understanding and knowledge as to how this all works,” Alston &amp; Bird’s Peterman says. “CISOs should be breathing a sigh of relief with this development, but I would be cautious about reading into it too broadly based on shifting changes within this administration or the next one,” Peterman adds.



“Brown had to live through five years of this, first, investigation and, then, litigation,” she says. “And I assume that comes with a significant personal toll, psychological toll, and physical toll. [Brown suffered a heart attack during the litigation.] If CISOs don’t have the necessary indemnification agreements or directors and officers [D&amp;O] insurance protections via the bylaws or by agreement, it can also mean that even if you win, it carries a significant financial toll.”



Noma Security’s Kelley emphasizes that CISOs will still be the face of cybersecurity for most organizations, which means continued diligence in how risks are communicated. “When customers or regulators or investors need answers, none of that has changed [as a result of the SolarWinds dismissal]. One of the takeaways is being very intentional and accurate in how we communicate about our programs.”



Sullivan advises CISOs and other security leaders to become proactive and communicate throughout the organization what they need. “It’s really important that we not sit in the corner and just let all the risks sit on our shoulders,” he says. “We have to engage with the rest of the executives and the CEO and say, ‘Look, cybersecurity is a company decision.’”



He also stresses that the CISO community owes a debt of gratitude to Brown for his fortitude. “A lot of us are really grateful for Tim for how he didn’t disappear during this process,” Sullivan says. “He spent a lot of time out at different events, typically closed-door ones, meeting with a lot of people. I had the opportunity to be on panels and calls with him where he and I shared a stage. All of us are very happy that Tim made it through this in one piece, and that he’s standing and that he still has his job.”

You can now tweak how warm and enthusiastic ChatGPT's responses are,"OpenAI gave its AI chatbot a professional makeover with the latest GPT-5.2 release, and some users are already complaining about its tone. For anyone who&#39;s finding ChatGPT rude or sassy, OpenAI has some welcome news since it&#39;s letting users further customize its personality with extra warmth or enthusiasm. 
You can now adjust specific characteristics in ChatGPT, like warmth, enthusiasm, and emoji use.Now available in your &#34;Personalization&#34; settings. pic.twitter.com/7WSkOQVTKU— OpenAI (@OpenAI) December 19, 2025
 


In a post on X, OpenAI revealed that users can adjust characteristics under new Warm, Enthusiastic, Header &amp; Lists and Emoji options found in the Personalization settings. Between the four options, you can choose between more, less or default to fine-tune exactly how you want ChatGPT to sound in its responses. These new characteristics come about a month after OpenAI added Professional, Candid and Quirky options to GPT-5.1 under the &#34;Base style and tone&#34; setting that&#39;s also found in the Personalization tab.
The latest customizations likely stem from the fiasco that OpenAI faced earlier this year when it rolled out GPT-5 to replace GPT-4o. The outcry from users revolved around the latest update sounding less conversational and friendly, leading OpenAI to offer the option to choose between models and promising to make GPT-5 feel warmer.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/you-can-now-tweak-how-warm-and-enthusiastic-chatgpts-responses-are-204003009.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F3e09f820-deab-11f0-9f7f-f10759b7cc31&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=d4697ed7ee1d6d71fb5de4b32cf6ce31f67a5d54,https://www.engadget.com/ai/you-can-now-tweak-how-warm-and-enthusiastic-chatgpts-responses-are-204003009.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-21T20:40:04Z,8,Tech

GuliKit's $20 mod makes the ROG Xbox Ally's joysticks drift-free,"There may not be any reports of stick drift with the ROG Xbox Ally yet, but that doesn&#39;t mean there won&#39;t be. If you&#39;d rather not end up with joysticks that have a mind of their own, GuliKit revealed its latest TMR Electromagnet Joystick Modules made specifically for your Xbox handheld.
GuliKit said it worked directly with Asus to develop these joystick upgrades, which match the exact dimensions of the ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X&#39;s stock sticks. The aftermarket accessories company previously designed a Hall effect joystick upgrade kit for the ROG Ally X, but GuliKit said this mod features electromagnetic joysticks that not only address stick drift but are also more precise, durable, and power-efficient. GuliKit even made the joystick upgrades easy to install since there&#39;s no soldering required, and you can fine-tune the calibration in the handheld&#39;s system settings.
It may feel excessive to spend more money on a gaming handheld that can cost up to $1,000, but neither the ROG Xbox Ally nor Ally X comes with Hall effect or electromagnetic joysticks. GuliKit&#39;s joystick upgrade is already available to US customers on its Amazon storefront for $19.99. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/gulikits-20-mod-makes-the-rog-xbox-allys-joysticks-drift-free-190521030.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2Faa70e2a0-de9a-11f0-95b7-f1023685451e&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=968191888d92f8dd92561300ce4e2d37cd18dfa3,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/gulikits-20-mod-makes-the-rog-xbox-allys-joysticks-drift-free-190521030.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-21T19:05:21Z,7,Tech

A San Francisco power outage left Waymo's self-driving cars stranded at intersections,"Several of Waymo&#39;s autonomous vehicles were seen stuck in the middle of San Francisco streets following a significant power outage that took out the city&#39;s traffic lights. Waymo responded to the power outage by suspending its ride-hailing services in the city, but images and videos on social media showed the self-driving taxis stopped at intersections with hazard lights on.
&#34;We have temporarily suspended our ride-hailing services in the San Francisco Bay Area due to the widespread power outage,&#34; Suzanne Philion, a spokesperson for Waymo, told Engadget in an email. &#34;Our teams are working diligently and in close coordination with city officials, and we are hopeful to bring our services back online soon.&#34;
The power outage was attributed to a fire at one of Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PG&amp;E)&#39;s substations. The incident began sometime on Saturday morning, which PG&amp;E said affected approximately 130,000 customers. As of Sunday morning, the Californian power company said its crews have restored power to about 110,000 of those customers, while working on the remaining 21,000 customers in &#34;the Presidio, Richmond District, Golden Gate Park and small areas of downtown San Francisco.&#34;
Waymo hasn&#39;t provided an explanation as to why the power outage left its autonomous cars stranded in San Francisco streets, but this episode may have revealed a notable fault with the Waymo Driver system. Waymo indicates on its website that its autonomous driving system &#34;responds to signs and signals, like traffic light colors and temporary stop signs,&#34; which could indicate that the self-driving cars struggled with the out-of-order street lights. Tesla&#39;s CEO, Elon Musk, also saw an opportunity to chime in on X, posting that &#34;Tesla Robotaxis were unaffected by the SF power outage.&#34;This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/a-san-francisco-power-outage-left-waymos-self-driving-cars-stranded-at-intersections-172316970.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2Faed25e70-de8e-11f0-bfae-118f5ed923d4&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=b0741a235986239a94ccb7747ea4772163b325c2,https://www.engadget.com/transportation/a-san-francisco-power-outage-left-waymos-self-driving-cars-stranded-at-intersections-172316970.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-21T17:23:16Z,7,Tech

Governor Hochul signs New York's AI safety act,"New York governor Kathy Hochul signed legislation on Friday aimed at holding large AI developers accountable for the safety of their models. The RAISE Act establishes rules for greater transparency, requiring these companies to publish information about their safety protocols and report any incidents within 72 hours of their occurrence. It comes a few months after California adopted similar legislation. But, the penalties aren&#39;t going to be nearly as steep as they were initially presented when the bill passed back in June. While that version included fines of up to $10 million dollars for a company&#39;s first violation and up to $30 million for subsequent violations, according to Politico, Hochul&#39;s version sets the fines at up to $1 million for the first violation, and $3 million for any violations after that. In addition to the new reporting rules, a new oversight office dedicated to AI safety and transparency is being born out of the RAISE Act. This office will be part of the Department of Financial Services, and issue annual reports on its assessment of large AI developers. Hochul signed two other pieces of AI legislation earlier in December that focused on the use of the technology in the entertainment industry. At the same time, President Trump has been pushing to curb states&#39; attempts at AI regulation, and signed an executive order this month calling for &#34;a minimally burdensome national standard&#34; instead.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/governor-hochul-signs-new-yorks-ai-safety-act-220503930.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2F2025-12%2Fa09f21ad-9a29-4ee5-9910-207bb682f256&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=ad2dfa4bc402153fb7cfe9e85d9d2066b121b5c5,https://www.engadget.com/ai/governor-hochul-signs-new-yorks-ai-safety-act-220503930.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-20T22:05:03Z,7,Tech

Sony's first EV with Honda will let you remotely play PS5 in your car,"Faraway road trips just got a lot easier, at least for the passengers. Sony Honda Mobility, the joint venture between the two Japanese conglomerates created to produce electric vehicles, announced that its Afeela EV will come with PS Remote Play. While playing video games in a car may be a niche feature, it means drivers will have something to do when parked, and passengers can chip away at their favorite RPGs during long drives.
According to the announcement, the Afeela will be able to run your PS5 and PS4 consoles remotely through the infotainment system&#39;s integrated display. You can even grab your DualSense controller from home and get right back into the game after jumping in your Afeela. Sony Honda Mobility said a 5Mbps broadband connection is required to play, and a 15Mbps rate will deliver a smoother experience.
It&#39;s not the first time we&#39;re hearing about PS Remote Play in an EV. The joint venture previously showed off the Afeela 1, which is set for its first deliveries in 2026, and its ability to remotely play PlayStation titles at CES 2024. As for gaming in EVs overall, Tesla famously offered Steam support for its Model S and X, but later removed this feature.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/sonys-first-ev-with-honda-will-let-you-remotely-play-ps5-in-your-car-202359091.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2Fd297ccc0-dddd-11f0-bf4f-99568eb074fc&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=bde6331969501e3440a001eecd8d3223d3753839,https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/sonys-first-ev-with-honda-will-let-you-remotely-play-ps5-in-your-car-202359091.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-20T20:23:59Z,7,Tech
Game publisher says cheaper Switch 2 cartridges are coming in since-deleted post,"Gamers who prefer physical copies of their favorite titles may be getting a major win with the Switch 2. In an unexpected announcement from retro video game publisher ININ Games, Nintendo reportedly has &#34;two new smaller cartridge sizes&#34; for its Switch 2 console. For ININ Games, these rumored game cartridges with smaller storage capacity allow the publisher to recalculate production costs and pursue a physical Switch 2 release of its upcoming R-Type Dimensions III.
ININ Games later deleted its posts mentioning these smaller Switch 2 cartridges and issued a correction on its website and social media pages. However, the publisher reiterated that R-Type Dimensions III will be released on a physical cartridge, but that &#34;no further technical details regarding cartridge specifications have been officially confirmed.&#34;
&#34;There has been no official announcement or confirmation from Nintendo concerning cartridge storage capacities,&#34; ININ Games said in a statement. &#34;Any references to specific storage sizes should not be interpreted as official information from Nintendo.&#34;
If we&#39;re reading between the lines, ININ Games may have been early to tease a crucial detail about Switch 2 cartridges that Nintendo wasn&#39;t officially ready to reveal yet. For more context, Nintendo reportedly only offers physical game cartridges for Switch 2 with a 64GB capacity. With less demanding games like R-Type Dimensions III, that much storage capacity could be unnecessary and raise production costs. Nintendo still hasn&#39;t made an announcement about these potential smaller cartridges, but we could see a lot more game publishers opting for physical copies of their upcoming games if they are indeed an option.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/game-publisher-says-cheaper-switch-2-cartridges-are-coming-in-since-deleted-post-191145230.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2Ff04858c0-ddce-11f0-bd72-ddf6a426bbc1&resize=1400%2C1050&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=fbf1030fd046c4888957bc13e54745f8fdd31bd0,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/game-publisher-says-cheaper-switch-2-cartridges-are-coming-in-since-deleted-post-191145230.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-20T19:11:45Z,7,Tech

Valve discontinued the last remaining LCD model of the Steam Deck,"If you still haven&#39;t bought into the Steam Deck craze, it&#39;ll cost you a little extra to take the plunge now since Valve is only offering OLED models. Valve announced in a note on its Steam Deck page that it&#39;s &#34;no longer producing the Steam Deck LCD 256GB model,&#34; adding that &#34;once sold out, it will no longer be available.&#34; As of this article&#39;s publishing, the $399 Steam Deck with LCD and 256 GB of storage, which we ranked as the best gaming handheld for most, is out of stock. Even Valve&#39;s refurbished stock of LCD models has been cleared out.
The OLED version of the Steam Deck is a worthy upgrade since it comes with a longer battery life and a larger display with a higher refresh rate. However, the LCD model offered an impressive entry price for the Steam Deck and the world of affordable gaming handhelds. Fortunately for existing owners, Valve said it plans to continue supporting the LCD models with future software updates.
For now, potential buyers will have to choose between the new entry-level pricing of $549 for the OLED model with 512GB of storage or upgrading to 1TB and paying at least $649. Valve&#39;s choice to discontinue its last remaining LCD model isn&#39;t surprising after it did the same with the 512GB version and the 64GB option that was available when the Steam Deck was first released in 2022.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/valve-discontinued-the-last-remaining-lcd-model-of-the-steam-deck-171548195.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F9e015740-ddc1-11f0-be74-6226acaaeb63&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=6619311e3eb20c43aa72eadbff9ceb6f2eebbd9e,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/valve-discontinued-the-last-remaining-lcd-model-of-the-steam-deck-171548195.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-20T17:15:48Z,9,Tech

AirTags are back on sale for $65 for a four-pack,"Most Apple products are pretty expensive, but some of the most affordable (and useful) ones are AirTags. The Bluetooth trackers are priced pretty reasonably even when not on sale, but they can be a steal if you can get them on a discount — like right now. A four pack of AirTags is on sale for $65 at Amazon, which is only a few dollars more than the record-low price we saw during Black Friday this year. 

  
If you place an order quickly, the AirTags should arrive in time for Christmas, making this a solid choice as a gift for someone with a tendency to misplace stuff. AirTags can also be useful for people who travel frequently, helping you to keep track of essentials like your passport as well as a way to keep tabs on luggage while you&#39;re on the go. 
If you do purchase some AirTags, we have some recommendations for useful accessories to go along with them, such as different styles of cases to best attach the trackers to different types of items. These are worth looking over and adding to your shopping cart in order to make the most of the product.  
AirTags have an IP67 rating for water and dust resistance and their replaceable batteries should last for about a year. They can also support Precision Finding, which gives more exact directions to a lost item, when paired with most models after the iPhone 11. Up to five people can share an AirTag&#39;s location, which is helpful for families or large travel groups.

AirPods Pro 3 drop to a record low of $199,"If you haven&#39;t yet upgraded to Apple&#39;s AirPods Pro 3, you can pick up the company&#39;s latest model at a discount through a deal on Amazon right now. The AirPods Pro 3, which came out in September, are currently down to $199. That&#39;s $50 off and the best price we&#39;ve seen. With the new AirPods Pro, Apple made some big improvements, including better battery life and sound quality, and introduced useful new features, such as Live Translation. 

  
The AirPods Pro 3 are the best AirPods available today, with Apple&#39;s H2 chip, and earned a score of 90 out of 100 in Engadget&#39;s review this fall. Active noise cancellation (ANC) is one of the biggest selling points of the AirPods Pro, and Apple has made the experience even better with the AirPods Pro 3. They sport new foam-infused ear tips that create a better seal to improve passive noise isolation, and as Engadget&#39;s Billy Steele wrote in his review, &#34;Ultra-low-noise microphones combine with advanced computational audio to silence even more background noise.&#34; In testing, they had no problem blocking out the chatter of people nearby or otherwise noisy environments. 
With the AirPods Pro 3, Apple introduced heart-rate sensing, so you&#39;ll be able to see your heart rate data from the earbuds in the Fitness app and other workout apps. The AirPods Pro 3 also boast Live Translation, which you can activate via controls on the earbuds themselves. As long as you have an Apple Intelligence-capable device, you&#39;ll be able to translate in-person conversations in English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish and Chinese (Mandarin).

Google Assistant will stick around a bit longer than expected for some Android users,"Google wanted to remove Assistant from most Android phones by the end of 2025 and replace it with Gemini. But now the company has announced that it needs a bit more time to make its AI assistant the new default digital helper for most of its users. Google said that it&#39;s adjusting its previously announced timeline to &#34;make sure [it delivers] a seamless transition&#34; and that updates to convert Assistant to Gemini on Android devices will continue into the next year. The company also said that it&#39;s sharing more details in the &#34;coming months,&#34; so it&#39;s possible that the transition will go past early 2026.Assistant&#39;s retirement was pretty much expected the moment Google launched Gemini and started giving it Assistant&#39;s capabilities, such as the ability to control smart devices connected to your phone. It launched the Pixel 9 Series with Gemini as the default assistant back in 2024. The company has also been putting Gemini in all of its products and previously said that it plans to upgrade all &#34;tablets, cars and devices that connect to your phone, such as headphones and watches&#34; with the AI-powered chatbot. Devices do have to meet a few minimum requirements to get the upgrade, however, and must be running Android 10 and come with 2GB of RAM at the very least.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-assistant-will-stick-around-a-bit-longer-than-expected-for-some-android-users-130000178.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2F2025-12%2Fcbc48ff3-7d27-4429-82b4-d21839eab92c&resize=1400%2C931&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=859a240d64ab26626669483a11740600e73ee075,https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-assistant-will-stick-around-a-bit-longer-than-expected-for-some-android-users-130000178.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-20T13:00:00Z,8,Tech

Iranian APT Prince of Persia returns with new malware and C2 infrastructure,"
		
					  
						




Researchers have discovered new activity from a threat actor dubbed Prince of Persia that’s believed to be tied to the Iranian government. The group appeared to have gone dormant in 2022 after multiple security companies documented its operations and crippled its command-and-control infrastructure, but new evidence shows the attackers retooled and continued to target new victims under the radar.



Prince of Persia, also known as Infy based on the name of its original malware, has been operating for almost 20 years. Researchers have noted likely ties to Iran based on the group’s target selection and other factors. Victims were previously identified in 35 countries and included Iranian dissidents and government targets from Europe and elsewhere.



The first company to document the group’s attacks and malware toolkit in detail was Palo Alto Networks back in 2016. That same year the company executed a successful takedown operation that involved sinkholing the group’s command-and control servers. However, the group was back one year later with new malware variants dubbed Foudre and Tonnerre — lighting and thunder in French.



“Despite the appearance of having gone dark in 2022, Prince of Persia threat actors have done quite the opposite,” researchers from security firm SafeBreach said in a new report. “Our ongoing research campaign into this prolific and elusive group has highlighted critical details about their activities, C2 servers, and identified malware variants in the last three years. This threat group is still active, relevant, and dangerous.”



Changes in malware delivery and C2 infrastructure



When the group fell off the radar in 2022, the latest known version of Foudre was v27 and for Tonnerre it was v15. Today, the most recent versions recovered by researchers are Foudre v34 and Tonnerre v17, both of which include significant changes.



Foudre is first-stage malware used for reconnaissance and victim identification. If a target is deemed important enough, the Tonnerre Trojan is deployed for data exfiltration and surveillance.



Foudre used to be distributed through malicious macros embedded in Microsoft Office documents sent as attachments in phishing emails on topics of interest to their targets. The latest version is delivered as an Excel file with an embedded malicious executable that’s not detected by any antivirus engine on VirusTotal.



The embedded executable is a self-extracting archive (SFX) file that contains a malicious DLL and a decoy MP4 video file. Excel files with malicious macros continue to be used and they attempt to execute a file called ccupdate.tmp.



One major difference compared to previous versions is the switch to a new domain generation algorithm (DGA) through which the malware determines on which domain names it will find the command-and-control server. Tonnerre v17 uses the same DGA with a different key prefix, meaning the domains it will generate for C2 will be different.



The SafeBreach researchers managed to identify many C2 servers and to extract data from them. Some servers were used for testing while other had data collected from real victims.



“Most of the victims were located in Iran, but there were some across Europe and countries like Iraq, Turkey, India, and Canada,” the researchers said. “While we have chosen not to publish the data here due to privacy concerns, we are more than willing to share the data with authorized law enforcement agencies.”



Monitoring the group’s campaigns is difficult because the attackers switch C2 servers quite often and they issue commands to delete the malware from the systems of victims that are no longer of interest.



A shift to Telegram



More recently, the researchers identified a new Tonnerre variant that’s advertised as v50, as well as an unknown new Foudre version that goes along with it. These versions use a new C2 server structure and, most importantly, can download a file from the server that enables Telegram communication via its API.



The Telegram feature is enabled only for a select number of victims, but the researchers managed to use the API to query the configured Telegram channel. It had two members, one of which was a channel bot and one user named Ehsan written in Farsi, who could be one of the hackers in charge of controlling the malware and who was last active as of Dec. 13.



“Ehsan is a common Persian name typical for an Iranian,” the researchers said. “This attribution is pretty strong in combination with the IP location of the attacker’s testing machine. We tracked the IP addresses used over several years, all of which indicated Iran as the location. While different IP location databases provided different cities, all of them were in Iran.”



The researchers also uncovered other samples of malware and payloads used in campaigns prior to 2022, including signs of an additional malware family called Rugissement (roar in French), a newer version of MaxPinner, a Telegram-based trojan used by the group in 2021, as well as various trojanized binaries used to distribute the malware.



The report includes details about the new DGA algorithms as well as indicators of compromise and sample hashes in hopes it will help other companies and researchers track the elusive group’s activities going forward.

Claude's Chrome plugin is now available to all paid users,"Anthropic is finally letting more people use Claude in Google Chrome. The company&#39;s AI browser plugin is expanding beyond $200-per-month Max subscribers and is now available to anyone who pays for a Claude subscription. The Claude Chrome plugin allows for easy access to Anthropic&#39;s AI regardless of where you are on the web, but its real draw is how it lets Claude navigate and use websites on your behalf. Anthropic says that Claude can fill out forms, manage your calendar and email and complete multi-step workflows based on a prompt. The latest version of the plugin also features integration with Claude Code, Anthropic&#39;s AI coding tool, and allows users to record a workflow and &#34;teach&#34; Claude how to do what they want it to do.Claude in Chrome is now available to all paid plans.We’ve also shipped an integration with Claude Code. pic.twitter.com/VLpB1qCntT— Claude (@claudeai) December 18, 2025
 

Before agents were the buzzword du jour, &#34;computer use,&#34; the ability for AI models to understand and interact with computer interfaces, was a major focus at Anthropic and other AI companies. Now computer use is just one tool in the larger tool bag for agents, but that understanding of what digital buttons to click and how to click them is what makes Claude&#39;s Chrome plugin possible.OpenAI and Perplexity offer similar agentic capabilities in their respective ChatGPT Atlas and Comet browsers. At this point the only AI company not fully setting its AI models loose on a browser is Google. You can access Gemini in Google Chrome and ask questions about a webpage, but Google hasn&#39;t yet let its AI model navigate or use the web on a user&#39;s behalf. Those features, first demoed in Project Mariner, are presumably on the way.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/claudes-chrome-plugin-is-now-available-to-all-paid-users-221024295.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2FClaude-in-Chrome.jpg&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=0cb6ada9cc90eccc2e4f3e090c7bce89a388645b,https://www.engadget.com/ai/claudes-chrome-plugin-is-now-available-to-all-paid-users-221024295.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-19T22:10:24Z,7,Tech

Netflix is acquiring game avatar maker Ready Player Me,"Netflix is acquiring Estonian startup Ready Player Me, a company creating &#34;cross-game avatar tech&#34; that allows players to bring their digital personas with them to different games, the company&#39;s CEO Timmu Tõke shared in a LinkedIn post. The acquisition is part of Netflix&#39;s new games strategy, which puts an emphasis on approachable multiplayer titles and adaptations of the streaming service&#39;s IP.Ready Player Me&#39;s team of around 20 employees will be incorporated into Netflix&#39;s staff, TechCrunch writes, though Tõke is the only one of the startup&#39;s four founders who will continue on after the acquisition. Neither company has shared when the avatar tech will be incorporated into Netflix&#39;s games or what games will support the feature when they do. Besides designing its avatar system to be easy for developers to implement in their games, Ready Player Me&#39;s big pitch for their system is using AI to automatically redesign avatars for different games&#39; art styles and &#34;automatically fit assets to any avatar rig or topology without manual work.&#34;Netflix has taken multiple different approaches  to games in the last few years, but lately, the company has actively retreated from AAA development and its more ambitious projects. Other than the premiere of its take on HQ Trivia, Netflix&#39;s last few game announcements of 2025 were focused on a collection of streamable party games, and a partnership with FIFA to release a new soccer sim in 2026. All of those projects could support avatars in one form or another, now Netflix just needs to decide how.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/netflix-is-acquiring-game-avatar-maker-ready-player-me-204443001.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2FReady-Player-Me-avatars.jpg&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=a37046e515641406995e9fddc8ceafc55aeb9b47,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/netflix-is-acquiring-game-avatar-maker-ready-player-me-204443001.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-19T20:44:43Z,13,Tech

Get up to 78 percent off ExpressVPN two-year plans for the holidays,"It looks like the holidays aren&#39;t a bad time to shop for a VPN subscription. ExpressVPN, Engadget&#39;s pick for the best premium provider, currently has a less premium price. This deal gives you two years of the Advanced plan (with a bonus of four free months) for only $101. When it isn&#39;t on sale, the same subscription would cost $392. 
Engadget&#39;s VPN guru, Sam Chapman, praised ExpressVPN&#39;s service. He described it as &#34;high-performing&#34; and having &#34;very few flaws.&#34; The service received high marks for its speeds, easy-to-use interface and global network availability. The only significant mark against it was its relatively high standard pricing. But with this holiday sale, that criticism is (temporarily) null and void. 

  
ExpressVPN recently switched to a multi-tier pricing structure. (That previously mentioned Advanced plan is the mid-range one.) There&#39;s a cheaper Basic plan that allows 10 simultaneous devices (compared to the Advanced plan&#39;s 12) and doesn&#39;t include perks like a password manager. You can also choose the highest-priced Pro plan. It allows for 14 simultaneous devices and adds several extras. You can compare plans on ExpressVPN&#39;s website. 
When buying a two-year plan, the Basic tier is available for $2.79 per month (78 percent off). The Advanced plan is $3.59 per month (74 percent off). And the Pro plan is $5.99 per month (70 percent off). All three include the bonus of four additional months, giving you 28 total.

The best iPad deals this week include the iPad mini for $100 off,"The iPad, of course, isn&#39;t the only tablet computer out there — it wasn&#39;t even the first — but Apple&#39;s version redefined the category. In our opinion, it&#39;s the best tablet you can buy and these slates consistently earn high scores in our reviews. That doesn&#39;t mean you should have to pay full price for your next iPad. We are continually on the hunt for good deals on iPads (and other Apple gear while we&#39;re at it) and each week, we round them up right there.Current discounts include the iPad mini and the 11-inch iPad Pro, each for $100 off the list price. Beyond iPads, are a few other Apple deals are going around, such as the latest AirPods Pro 3 for the lowest price yet at $199 and certain colors of the Apple Watch Series 11 for $299. Here are the best Apple deals we found this week. 
Best iPad deals 

  
Apple iPad Air (M3, 11-inch) for $499 ($100 off): The iPad Air is the top overall pick in our guide to the best iPads. Yes, it’s pricier than the entry-level iPad (A16), but its faster chip, extra RAM, laminated and more color-rich display, better speakers and superior accessory support add up to a more pleasant experience in day-to-day use. This isn&#39;t the lowest price we&#39;ve tracked — the price went as low as $450 just after Black Friday, but this is still $100 cheaper than buying directly from Apple. 
Apple iPad Pro (11-inch, M5) for $899 ($100 off): The latest iPad Pro is still more tablet than most people will ever need, but its class-leading OLED display, impressively thin design and super-powerful M5 chip make it a luxury experience for those who can afford it. The device was only released in October, so this deal ties its lowest price to date. Also at Best Buy and B&amp;H. 
Apple iPad Pro (13-inch, M5) for $1,199 ($100 off): It’s not a massive discount, but this matches the lowest price so far for the larger iPad Pro, which may be worthwhile if you’ve got cash to burn and want to use an iPad as your main computer. We gave it a score of 85 in our review. Also at B&amp;H. 
Best Apple deals 

  
Apple AirTags (4-pack) for $65 ($34 off): These are the best Bluetooth trackers for iPhone users thanks to their vast finding network and accurate ultra-wideband features for locating your things when they’re close by. Just attach them to your keys, wallet or bag with the right AirTag holder and keep track of everything in the Find My app. 
Apple AirPods 4 for $74 ($55 off): If you don&#39;t need active noise cancellation and hate the feeling of headphones that just into your ear canal, the standard AirPods 4 remain a good buy. They lack built-in volume controls, and no open-style earbuds can produce the same level of bass as typical in-ear headphones, but they generally sound more pleasant than most pairs along these lines and still offer the usual array of Apple-friendly features. This discount is only $5 more than the all-time low we saw around Black Friday. Also at Best Buy for $85 if that runs out of stock.  

  
Apple Watch SE 3 for $199 ($50 off): This discount has been around for a few weeks, but it’s the lowest price to date for Apple’s newest entry-level smartwatch. We gave the SE 3 a score of 90 in our review last month: The big upgrade is an always-on display, which makes it so you no longer have to wake the watch to check the time or notifications. It still includes most of the essential health and fitness features beyond that, plus it now runs on the same chipset as the higher-end Apple Watch Series 11. Also at Walmart. 
Apple Pencil Pro for $95 ($34 off): The Pencil Pro is Apple’s most feature-rich stylus, offering pressure sensitivity, wireless charging, haptic feedback and unique gesture controls compared to the standard USB-C model (which isn’t significantly discounted). Just note that it’s not compatible with the entry-level iPad and other older models. While this discount is only $5 below the device’s usual street price, it’s still the largest discount we’ve seen this year. Also at Walmart. 

  
Apple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $949 ($250 off): The 15-inch MacBook Air is nearly identical to the smaller version; apart from its roomier display, it adds better speakers and a more spacious trackpad. This deal matches the all-time low, and other configurations are similarly discounted.  
Apple MacBook Pro (M5, 14-inch, 512GB) for $1,350 ($249 off): Apple’s most recent M-series chip is the M5, and only comes equipped on the 14-inch MacBook Pro and the iPad Pro. When the M5 MacBook Pro M5 came out in October, we promptly reviewed it and awarded it a 92. The new chip gives the laptop an impressive graphics upgrade, which only adds to the Pro&#39;s known qualities: a sturdy build, excellent trackpad and speakser paired with an impressively long battery life — we clocked 34 hours in a video run-down test. Also at Walmart. It&#39;s $1,399 at Best Buy and B&amp;H. 
Apple Mac mini (M4) for $479 ($120 off): The latest iteration of Apple’s tiny desktop PC has a smaller footprint, a faster M4 chip, 16GB of RAM by default, two front-facing USB-C ports and an extra Thunderbolt 4 port. It can also drive three external displays, though it lacks USB-A ports entirely. We gave a higher-end model with Apple’s M4 Pro chip a score of 90 in our review. This deal on the base model with an M4 chip, 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage is $10 more than the best deal we&#39;ve seen but $20 less than the config&#39;s typical street price.  
Apple MagSafe cable 25W for $24 ($15 off): With this puck, the iPhone 17 can wirelessly recharge at 25-watt speeds. You can also get those speeds with iPhone 16 handsets that have updated to the latest OS 26 version. Just note that you’ll need to plug it into at least a 30 watt adapter, which isn’t included. This is the lowest price we&#39;ve tracked.  
Apple USB-C Magic Mouse for $68 ($11 off): This isn&#39;t a record-low price for Apple&#39;s popular mouse — it went for $60 in October. It&#39;s lightweight, supports multi-touch features including scroll and the battery life is fairly long — just note that the charging port is on the bottom so you can&#39;t use it while it refills. The discount only applies to the white model.

Mark Zuckerberg's nonprofit cuts ties with the immigration advocacy group he co-founded,"Behold Mark Zuckerberg: man of principle. Witness the Meta CEO&#39;s dedication to the most high-minded of causes: &#34;currying favor with whoever&#39;s in charge.&#34; In 2013, when Barack Obama was president, Zuckerberg co-founded FWD.us, a pro-immigration advocacy group. For years, he vocally supported providing paths to citizenship for &#34;the most talented and hardest-working people, no matter where they were born.&#34; Now, in 2025, with Donald Trump back in power and pushing draconian immigration policies, Zuckerberg&#39;s philanthropy organization has officially cut ties with the group. Who says Big Tech executives don&#39;t stand for anything?On Friday, Bloomberg reported on the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) severing its ties with FWD.us. Zuckerberg&#39;s group provided no funding to the advocacy group for the first time this year. Up to that point, over half of the roughly $400 million donated to the nonprofit since 2013 had come from CZI.In addition, CZI&#39;s chief of staff, Jordan Fox, resigned from the FWD.us board. No one else at CZI will fill the vacant slot, another first for the pro-immigration and justice reform advocacy group.In late 2024, Zuckerberg met with Trump adviser Stephen Miller, who reacts to brown-skinned humans being sent to foreign gulags the way my dog responds to a juicy steak. Among other topics during the exchange, Miller reportedly questioned Zuckerberg&#39;s ties to FWD.us.Mark Zuckerberg listens attentively to Stephen Miller at Trump&#39;s January inaugurationBRENDAN SMIALOWSKI via Getty ImagesApparently, his words resonated with Zuckerberg’s principles. In January, before Trump was sworn in for his second term, Meta unleashed an overhaul that reads like a Miller wishlist. The company ended its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs. That same month, it ditched third-party fact-checkers, calling them &#34;too politically biased.&#34; It also changed its policies to allow for &#34;insulting language&#34; on topics of immigration and LGBTQ+ issues. The company even added Trump backer Dana White to its board.It fits a broader pattern of Big Tech bending the knee to Trump.&#34;We&#39;re in the middle of a pretty rapidly changing policy and regulatory landscape that views any policy that might advantage any one group of people over another as something that is unlawful,&#34; Zuckerberg told the New York Times in January. &#34;Because of that, we and every other institution out there are going to need to adjust.&#34;&#34;We now have a US administration that is proud of our leading companies, prioritizes American technology winning and that will defend our values and interests abroad,&#34; Zuckerberg said in a January investor call. &#34;I am optimistic about the progress and innovation that this can unlock, so this is going to be a big year.&#34;What a big year indeed.US Chief Border Patrol Agent, Gregory Bovino and masked ICE agents in New OrleansRyan Murphy via Getty ImagesNow witness the contrasting words of one of Zuckerberg&#39;s chief rivals in Silicon Valley. &#34;When you meet these [immigrant] children who are really talented, and they&#39;ve grown up in America, and they really don&#39;t know any other country besides that, but they don&#39;t have the opportunities that we all enjoy, it&#39;s really heartbreaking, right?&#34; the tech executive said. &#34;That seems like it&#39;s one of the biggest civil rights issues of our time.&#34;That &#34;rival,&#34; of course, was Obama-era Mark Zuckerberg in 2013.Despite the funding setback, thanks to our principled hero, FWD.us will press forward. &#34;We&#39;re thankful to our donors, past and present, and so grateful to the many new donors who have stepped up in the past few years — and particularly the influx of new supporters we have seen this year,&#34; FWD.us President Todd Schulte said in a statement. &#34;This allows us to fight for immigrants under attack today and to build a better approach to immigration and criminal justice reform for many, many years to come.&#34;This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/mark-zuckerbergs-nonprofit-cuts-ties-with-the-immigration-advocacy-group-he-co-founded-183447900.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2F2025-09%2Fe6f2eca9-7ce6-47ea-a61c-65066ad95689&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=67a95f35a4dc964017ce104c2d599b2520ca0314,https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/mark-zuckerbergs-nonprofit-cuts-ties-with-the-immigration-advocacy-group-he-co-founded-183447900.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-19T18:34:47Z,15,Tech

Apple's USB-C Magic Mouse is back on sale for $68,"Amazon is selling Apple&#39;s USB-C Magic Mouse for $68, which is a discount of 14 percent. This isn&#39;t a record-low price, but it&#39;s darned close. The mouse typically sells for $79, though today&#39;s sale only applies to the white model. 
It&#39;s rare for official Apple accessories to go on sale, and the USB-C Magic Mouse is pretty much a must-have for those working on desktop computers. It&#39;s also fairly handy when combined with a laptop, letting folks avoid the trackpad. 

  
As the name suggests, this mouse charges via USB-C. Apple stuck with replaceable AA batteries for way too long, so this change was much appreciated. A charge should power the mouse for around a month, a metric I find to be more-or-less accurate depending on usage. 
This is a good mouse, and a great option for Apple devotees, but it&#39;s not without its flaws. The biggest one is port placement. The USB-C port is underneath the mouse, rendering it unusable while charging. Bloomberg recently reported that a major redesign is coming for Apple&#39;s wireless mouse that should address that issue.

WatchGuard fixes ‘critical’ zero-day allowing firewall takeover,"
		
					  
						




WatchGuard has issued an urgent patch alert for its Firebox firewall appliances after discovering a critical-rated vulnerability that is under exploit by threat actors.



Tracked as CVE-2025-14733, with a CVSS score of 9.3, the flaw is an Out-of-bounds Write vulnerability affecting the iked process, a WatchGuard Fireware OS component responsible for the IKEv2 key exchange in IPSec VPNs.



According to the WatchGuard advisory, this weakness could “allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code,” taking control of the appliance through remote code execution (RCE) without having to log in.



Because it was under attack before a patch was made available by WatchGuard on December 18, this makes CVE-2025-14733 a bona fide zero-day vulnerability. The first job for admins should therefore be to check Firebox appliances for signs of current or recent compromise.



WatchGuard’s advisory lists four IP addresses associated with exploitation; outbound traffic to them is “a strong indicator of compromise,” while inbound connections from them “could indicate reconnaissance efforts or exploit attempts,” the advisory said. With logging enabled, other strong indicators were an IKE_AUTH request log message with an abnormally large CERT payload greater than 2,000 bytes, or evidence of an iked process hang, the company said.



Affected Fireware OS versions are 2025.1 up to and including 2025.1.3, 12.0 up to and including 12.11.5, and legacy 11.10.2 up to and including 11.12.4_Update1. 



The resolved versions are 2025.1.4, 12.11.6, 12.5.15 (T15 &amp; T35 models), and 12.3.1_Update4 (B728352) for the FIPS-certified release. There is no fix for 11.x, which is considered end of life.



Importantly, WatchGuard warned, patching may not be enough: “If the Firebox was previously configured with the mobile user VPN with IKEv2 or a branch office VPN using IKEv2 to a dynamic gateway peer, and both of those configurations have since been deleted, that Firebox may still be vulnerable if a branch office VPN to a static gateway peer is still configured.”



And some admins have even more post-patching tasks to perform, it said, noting, “in addition to installing the latest Fireware OS that contains the fix, administrators that have confirmed threat actor activity on their Firebox appliances must take precautions to rotate all locally stored secrets on vulnerable Firebox appliances.”



Deja vu



In September, WatchGuard patched a similar Firebox vulnerability, CVE-2025-9242, also affecting the iked VPN configuration and given a CVSS score of 9.3. At the time, WatchGuard said there were no reports of active exploitation, but by October, the company had revised this assessment after exploitation attempts were detected.



This is a reminder not to read initial vulnerability assessments for this type of infrastructure too optimistically — exploitation is frequently detected after a flaw has been made public. Firewalls and VPNs are major targets for cybercriminals, and every significant vulnerability in them represents a clear and present cyber security risk.



Unfortunately, the evidence shows that some WatchGuard customers don’t patch vulnerabilities as quickly as they should. In October, a scan by The Shadowserver Foundation found that over 71,000 Firebox appliances had not yet been patched for CVE-2025-9242, including 23,000 in the US. Despite its zero-day status, it’s likely to be a similar story for CVE-2025-14733.



Slow or reluctant patching might also explain why Russian-aligned ‘Sandworm’ hackers were recently discovered to be targeting WatchGuard Firebox and XTM appliances by exploiting CVEs dating back several years.

"We have more details on the TikTok deal, including some ownership statistics","TikTok has signed a deal to spin off its American business, according to reporting from Associated Press and others. This should keep the popular social media app available in the US for good, capping off years of drama.
We now have some new data as to the specifics of the deal. Nearly 50 percent of assets will be split between three companies. Oracle, Silver Lake and MGX will each control around 15 percent of the newly-formed entity. It&#39;s worth noting that MGX isn&#39;t an American company at all, but rather Abu Dhabi’s state-owned investment firm.
The rest will remain in the hands of affiliates of TikTok&#39;s parent company, ByteDance. That company will also take a direct ownership stake of around 20 percent. US platform operations will be managed by a seven-member board of directors. The majority of this board will be Americans.

US data will be stored under a system operated by Oracle. That company is run by Larry Ellison, a long-time ally of President Trump who once brainstormed ideas on how to overturn the 2020 presidential election. Oracle has been trying to get its mitts on TikTok since at least 2020. As for Silver Lake, it has deep ties to Trump allies like Michael Dell and his son-in-law Jared Kushner.
The deal is expected to close on January 22, according to an internal memo shared by TikTok CEO Shou Chew. &#34;With these agreements in place, our focus must stay where it’s always been — firmly on delivering for our users, creators, businesses and the global TikTok community,&#34; he wrote to employees.
If a deal is truly finalized by next month, it will come just over a year after Trump&#39;s first executive order to delay a law that required a sale of the app to prevent a ban. He has signed several other extensions since.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/we-have-more-details-on-the-tiktok-deal-including-some-ownership-statistics-163003507.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F62f49620-dcf5-11f0-bfd9-ceacc9ead0b2&resize=1400%2C867&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=cd2c5a41ca0ea9380b46a519742c553a22a3976f,https://www.engadget.com/social-media/we-have-more-details-on-the-tiktok-deal-including-some-ownership-statistics-163003507.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-19T16:30:03Z,7,Tech

One of our favorite budgeting apps is 50 percent off right now,"If you have a resolution in the new year to get more acquainted with your finances, a good budgeting app can help with that. One of our favorites is a bit cheaper to sign up for right now: Monarch Money is offering 50 percent off annual subscriptions for new users. Use the code MONARCHVIP at checkout to get half off, so you&#39;ll pay just $50 for one year of access. 

  
Monarch Money was the runner-up in our guide to the best budgeting apps in 2025, and it was definitely a grower. Initially we found the experience of using the app to be needlessly complicated compared to some of its rivals, but get over that hurdle and it’s impressively fully-featured. There are plenty of customization options, a helpful “goals” feature and a thorough month-in-review recap that beats out similar features from some of its competitors. We also like how you can grant account access to others. 
Besides the steep learning curve, we also noted that the mobile app is less intuitive to use than the web version, which might pose a problem if you were hoping to do most of your accounting on the go. We also had some issues with the app failing to distinguish between bills and other recurring expenses, as well as a few bugs along the way. 
All things considered, Monarch is definitely one of our favorite budgeting apps, only being beaten out by Quicken Simplifi. As you might expect, the biggest strength of Simplifi is its simplicity, and how it eases you into using its various features. If you value that kind of user experience, it might be a better choice for you, but there’s unfortunately no free trial to take advantage of.

Engadget's favorite games of 2025,"From indies like Silksong, to AAAs like Ghost of Yotei, and everything in between, 2025 truly had it all, and is likely to go down in the history books as one of the best years in gaming. But these are the games that felt truly special to the Engadget team. Arc Raiders I’m genuinely shocked by how much I love ARC Raiders. I’ve never been very interested in the whole PvE (Player vs. Environment) genre, aside from some brief stints with Destiny, but ARC Raiders&#39;s sci-fi post-apocalyptic vibe just works for me. I love the Blade Runner/anime-like aesthetic of its environments, enemies and outfits. I’m a sucker for its synthy soundtrack and immersive soundscape. And somehow, I’ve just fallen for the game’s loop, which involves running out for resources and missions, and hopefully making it back home safe. Sure, I’ve had a few runs where I’ve lost all my gear, thanks to random online jerks. But even those setbacks kept me motivated to play. You can always head out into the world with free gear, so if you fail, all you really lose is a bit of time. ARC Raiders reminds me of playing Phantasy Star Online on the Dreamcast decades ago, an early multiplayer experience that’s genuinely been hard for me to replicate since then.   I sometimes explore maps just to soak up their architecture and environmental sounds. Sometimes I jump in to help other players, especially when they’re being harassed by others. Through success or failure, I can’t wait to head back in. — Devindra Hardawar, Senior Editor AvowedObsidian kicked off 2025 with a bang, introducing a fresh and deeply engaging fantasy RPG universe in Avowed. It’s an expertly crafted and narratively rich adventure through mystical lands blighted by a mysterious fungus, set against a backdrop of political scheming, spiritual manipulation, colonization and resistance. The writing is stellar throughout, though the sidequests that reveal your companions’ backstories are particularly poignant. Avowed is gorgeous, its combat systems are fully customizable, its characters are intriguing and its encumbrance limit is generous. There’s a real sense of magic about the entire game — and no, that’s not just the mind-altering mushrooms talking.— Jessica Conditt, Senior ReporterBaby StepsBaby Steps is a true walking simulator: Your left trigger controls your left leg, and your right trigger controls your right. At first, you&#39;ll be stumbling and comically falling every few paces, and it’s easy to write the game off as some sort of Octodad affair, where half the fun is dealing with the jank of basic navigation. But before long, you’ll find the rhythm and confidently pace through the game’s open world.Of course, the challenge ramps up with your skill. Baby Steps has incredibly tight mechanics and a rewarding if punishing difficulty curve. Various surfaces and steeper inclines are introduced, and the game ends with a truly horrific mountain pass. Through it all, you’ll be treated to a light but touching story full of comedic improvisation from the game’s developers, who voice most of the characters themselves.— Aaron Souppouris, Editor-in-chiefBall X PitI don’t usually go in for roguelike-style games, but my colleague Kris Holt convinced me to try Ball X Pit and, in doing so, ruined my autumn. This is, quite simply, one of the most addictive games I’ve ever played. The base gameplay is rooted in classic Brick Breaker-style games from the ‘80s. Balls bounce from the bottom to the top of the screen, but instead of hitting and breaking bricks you’re bouncing them off a massive series of demonic enemies. There are eight levels and over a dozen different playable characters, each with their own distinct strengths and play styles, and the vast combination of upgrades you can unlock means no run will ever be quite the same. Perhaps the most fun thing about it is unlocking the different fusions and evolutions you can find along the way. Beyond the basic balls that your character shoots, you have slots for special balls that do things like freeze enemies, deal extra damage or blind enemies so they can’t accurately attack you. You can combine those special balls into even more powerful weapons, and finding the best evolutions that work with each character and each level adds yet another layer to the madness. While you can easily pick it up and play for 20 or 30 minutes, I’ve found it pretty difficult to end a session without whiling away multiple hours. Think carefully about whether you’re ready to ruin your productivity for a few weeks (or months) before you dive into Ball X Pit.— Nathan Ingraham, Deputy EditorBlue PrinceMy absolute favorite experience in all of gaming is when I&#39;m several hours into a puzzle game and I discover there&#39;s more going on than meets the eye. It&#39;s the moment where I realize an already-good game is in fact an excellent one, and I want to simultaneously curse the creators&#39; evil brains and applaud their brilliance. I feel fortunate if I have that reaction once during a playthrough. Blue Prince provided me with that experience of total delight many times over. The biggest downside to a game like Blue Prince is that it&#39;s hard to talk about. For starters, it defies categorization. Sure, there are some roguelike elements and obviously plenty of puzzles, but playing it goes beyond a single genre tag. And more importantly, the journey of uncovering its surprises is a big reason why this game is so special. If you haven&#39;t tried it yet, I strongly suggest you do so and that you read as little about it as possible before diving in. All you need to know is that if you enjoy burrowing ever deeper into a rabbit hole of mysteries and problem-solving, you must play this game. Blue Prince is a real masterpiece by creative lead Tonda Ros and the whole Dogubomb team. It earns all the hype it gets.— Anna Washenko, Contributing ReporterCitizen Sleeper 2: Starward VectorNo game I played this year has stuck with me the way Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector did. At a time when it feels like our governments are failing us and corporate greed is destroying the world, Citizen Sleeper 2 tells a critical story about finding hope and purpose in the people and communities around you. And as great as the original Citizen Sleeper was, the new one is an even better game, with more polished systems that do a great job of reinforcing its narrative themes. There&#39;s a good chance many of you missed Citizen Sleeper 2, seeing as it arrived at the start of the year, but if you&#39;re feeling down about the state of the world, I can&#39;t recommend it enough. It will change your perspective.— Igor Bonifacic, Senior ReporterClair Obscur: Expedition 33Clair Obscur made a striking impression when we first glimpsed it in 2024, with its French dark fantasy aesthetic, its wild concept of a god-like Paintress and a turn-based combat system that seemed uniquely cinematic. It instantly became my most anticipated game of 2025. Thankfully, the game itself lived up to my expectations, with a thrilling story, memorable characters and some of the most beautiful visuals I’ve ever seen in a game. Sure, its twists and turns might not feel entirely surprising if you’re an RPG connoisseur, but no other game captures such a specific vibe. It may not fully stick the landing, but Clair Obscur was certainly one of the most fulfilling narrative experiences I experienced this year.   — D.H.Date Everything!This dating sim is witty as heck. That&#39;s the first reason I loved Date Everything. The writing is equal parts sharp and sensitive, silly and sincere, with a dose of pointed social commentary in between bouts of flirtation with anthropomorphized household items. Even the artwork is witty, transforming everything from a toaster to a treadmill into attractive humans in wildly clever and creative ways. The second and most important reason I loved this game is that Date Everything is a cavalcade of virtuoso voice acting that must be heard to be appreciated. I&#39;ve played a bunch of visual novels without voiceover where the writing alone wasn&#39;t strong enough to make the characters pop, as well as voiced ones where middling performances detracted from the story. Date Everything&#39;s cast of 100 of the best in the business make their dialogue shine (and like I said, the dialogue is really damn good). There are some endearingly obvious casting choices. The horny clothes dryer? Yeah, it&#39;s Neil Newbon, who probably charmed your pants off as Astarion in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. Your D&amp;D dice set? It couldn&#39;t be anyone but Matt Mercer. On the flip side, Cherami Lee as perky Chairemi (yep, your chairs) was unrecognizable from her stellar turn as V in Cyberpunk 2077. Laura Bailey has voiced countless heroines over the years, so the last place I expected to hear her was screaming her lungs out as one half of the toxic relationship playing out in your laundry room. Whether you&#39;re looking for love or laughs, Date Everything is a marvelous showcase of talents that often go underappreciated in gaming. — A.W.DespeloteHaving grown up with grandparents from South America, I&#39;m familiar with a flavor of soccer fanaticism that hasn&#39;t quite taken root in the US. What makes Despelote so moving to play in 2025 is how it makes that sports fandom universal. The semi-autobiographical game lets you play your way through narrative vignettes, rendered in a stunning mix of filtered, photorealistic backgrounds and almost comics-inspired characters, primarily with a soccer ball at your feet. There&#39;s more to the game than kicking, however.Despelote asks players to walk, run and kick through the life of the game&#39;s lead developer Julian Cordero as he recounts his memories of Ecuador&#39;s historic attempt to win the World Cup. It&#39;s a personal history and national one, and by the end of the game, not quite what it seems. To put it another way: Despelote is melancholy, humorous and quite possibly the first game to capture what soccer means rather just than what it feels like to play.— Ian Carlos Campbell, Contributing ReporterDispatchIf you miss the heyday of Telltale&#39;s multiple choice narratives, like The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us, and you aren&#39;t tired of superheroes yet, you&#39;ll love Dispatch. Developed by AdHoc Studio, which was formed by former Telltale alum, it&#39;s essentially a workplace dramedy for superheroes. But the mechanics don&#39;t matter as much as the characters, who are all uniquely intriguing, sad and hilarious. You play as Robert Robertson III, AKA Mecha Man, a former Iron Man-esque hero who can no longer fight crime on his own. He decides to manage a group of former villains for SDN (the Superhero Dispatch Network), hoping to imbue them with his own ideals of heroism. By day, you assign them to deal with crimes around Los Angeles, but through conversations and crucial Telltale decisions, you also encourage them to work as a team and hopefully become better people (or mutants). Buoyed by strong voice acting (including actors like Aaron Paul as the lead, and Jeffrey Wright in a hilarious supporting role), AdHoc&#39;s sharp writing, and excellent animation, Dispatch is a reminder of just how powerful adventure games can be.   — D.H.Donkey Kong BananzaThe Switch 2 had a decent enough first year, but there&#39;s only one true killer app so far in my mind. Donkey Kong Bananza is the primary reason to pony up for Nintendo&#39;s new console. It&#39;s a 3D platforming classic up there with any Mario game, which makes sense given that the team behind Super Mario Odyssey made this one. It actually reinvents the formula by adding wanton destruction into the mix. Donkey Kong can destroy just about everything in the game and that&#39;s not hyperbole. You can literally spend hours absolutely pummelling entire game worlds into dust. This isn&#39;t just a stress reliever, as it leads to new kinds of puzzles and platforming ideas. As a bonus, DK is joined by a young Pauline, making this the cutest riff on The Last of Us ever. — Lawrence Bonk, Contributing ReporterFast FusionFast Fusion is a sci-fi arcade racer that wants little more than to bring the old Wipeout and 3D F-Zero games into modern times. Those games ruled. So does this one. As the name implies, it is seriously fast, and it commits to enhancing that sense of speed with every choice it makes. Whooshing lines drag from the back of your hard-angled, anti-grav ships. Their engines wheeze. The backgrounds blur. Each course is littered with boost pads, and there’s a boost meter you can keep persistently charged by taking turns just right. Because this is what some may call a “video game-ass video game,” you can also make your ship jump, skipping entire turns or launching into a fiery wreck in equal measure. The courses here aren’t as thematically consistent as those in Mario Kart World. One minute you’re dashing through an Endor-style forest, the next you’re dodging tornadoes on a rainy highway. There are no cute mascots, either. But the tracks are spectacles, and they always give room to keep up your pace. When there is an obstacle to dodge, you tend to just whiz by, furthering the sense of threading the needle. In a year unusually loaded with high-profile arcade racers, few are better than Fast Fusion at keeping you engaged. It makes blinking feel risky. — Jeff Dunn, Senior ReporterGhost of YōteiSucker Punch Productions&#39; return to a feudal Japan setting is another triumph for the studio. In Ghost of Yōtei, the developer crafted a world that I happily got lost in for hours, doing everything and anything but the main story missions until I absolutely had to. There was something to do around almost every corner and some of the game&#39;s many secrets were well-hidden. That&#39;s not to say the game&#39;s plot is anything to sniff at: this is a brutal tale of revenge, featuring rich writing and performances. The open-world format is a little at odds with protagonist Atsu’s steely desire for vengeance, but Ghost of Yōtei is beautifully orchestrated enough for that to be a minor complaint. The combat is stellar — to be most effective, you’ll need to swap between weapons to counter what your current opponent is wielding. Still, I couldn’t help but use the kusarigama whenever possible, especially to carry out stealthy assassinations from a distance. Strengthening Atsu’s bond with a wild wolf that becomes an ally in combat is also a highlight, while the deeply customizable difficulty settings are very welcome.Like its predecessor, Ghost of Tsushima, this is a technical masterpiece. Sucker Punch created another lush game that will surely be the source of countless desktop backgrounds. Blood-stained snow has rarely looked this good, especially if you enable the Miike Mode (named after director Takashi Miike and his gory films) to really paint the landscape red.— Kris Holt, Contributing ReporterHades 2The first thing to know about Hades II is that it&#39;s more Hades. It&#39;s the standard roguelite RNG grindfest, but with charm and enough detail-oriented flourishes to disguise what is essentially cranking the arm on a slot machine. The second thing to know is that you are no longer Zagreus, but Melinoë, princess of the underworld, and if you are a gay woman this game exists to roast you mercilessly. Zag was a lovable himbo engaged in a petty dispute against his father and free to romance a variety of Greek gods along the way. By contrast the world around Mel is coming apart at the seams, and her dating options are considerably less satisfying. Several of her in-game relationships with women are written to be warm and reciprocal, but of course they&#39;re with the found family of deities who support her. Nemesis and Eris, her two options for romance, seem to actively hate her and, after dozens of runs, are never interested in anything beyond a threadbare situationship. Juggling two different mission paths with their own distinct enemies and biomes is a treat — as are the new, sometimes brutally hard bosses. If only the rest didn&#39;t so closely resemble the indignities of dating in your 30s. — Avery Ellis, Deputy EditorIs This Seat Taken?Every incurable people pleaser has been told, at some point in their life, “you can’t make everyone happy.” Perhaps not in life. But in the sweetly cozy, zero-pressure, logic-puzzle indie game Is This Seat Taken? making people happy is not only possible, it’s the entire point. The game is set in a line-drawn, sepia-toned Barcelona and other cities. You act as a set of pinching fingers that lifts and places shape-people in their preferred seats — on the bus, in a restaurant, at a movie theater and so on. Each person has preferences (window seat, no bad smells, wants to read) and attributes (forgot to shower, plays loud music) that mesh or conflict.Tiny accessories and icons not only make each shape more adorable, they help keep track of some of their proclivities. Bubbly smiles or heartbreaking frowns tell you whether you’ve met a seated shape’s needs, and tapping on them tells you exactly what they want. A simple story involving a few of the shapes and an indie film takes form as you advance levels, but for the most part, you’re just checking in on what people want and arranging them to optimize happiness. I obsessively plowed through the game, soothed by the strummy music, delighted by the plops, bloops and chatters of the sound effects. As more people get on the bus (show up to the coworking space, arrive at the restaurant) it gets increasingly tougher to satisfy everyone — more than once I had to clear everyone off the train and start from scratch — but achieving 100 percent contentment is always possible. And if that’s not true IRL, then at least it is here.   — Amy Skorheim, Senior ReporterKeeperKeeper is a surprisingly quiet and soul-soothing experience from Double Fine Productions, a studio best known for sassy, cartoon-style games like Costume Quest, Psychonauts and Brütal Legend. Keeper is a gorgeous and dialogue-free adventure through fantastical lands of deep shadows and vivid pastels, presented in a claymation-like art style that’s a joy to interact with. The game follows a sentient, walking lighthouse and its bird companion as they attempt to reach a mountaintop and cleanse the land of a nasty parasitic presence. Keeper only lasts about four hours tops, but its striking visuals, smooth mechanics and heartwarming story leave a lasting impression.— J.C.Kingdom Come: Deliverance IIKingdom Come: Deliverance II is a modern-day Morrowind. I mean that as a compliment. It&#39;s a game built on a series of complex, interlocking systems that work together to create one of the most immersive worlds I&#39;ve had a chance to experience in recent years. As I guided my version of Henry of Skalitz through Warhorse Studios&#39; beautiful recreation of 15th century Bohemia, I spent dozens of hours doing mundane things like blacksmithing, playing dice, foraging for herbs and concocting potions. Each of these activities feels like it could be a game on its own, and they work together to create an experience that feels refreshingly old-school. No one is making RPGs like Warhorse anymore — not even Bethesda — and that&#39;s what makes this game feel so special. It&#39;s the kind of experience studios used to make when games didn&#39;t need to appeal to everyone to recoup their development costs. — I.B.Look OutsideMonths after its release, Look Outside is still the game I can&#39;t shut up about, and it probably will continue to be for the foreseeable future. In Look Outside, your character wakes up to discover that an apocalyptic event has taken place, and anyone who looks outside to observe it is transformed into some sort of abomination. You have to survive two weeks inside your apartment building, gathering resources and, if you&#39;re trusting, accumulating allies to fight by your side. There are monsters everywhere, and their designs are wildly creative. It&#39;s a joy encountering all of the freakish creatures for the first time.There are tons of choices to make in Look Outside that will affect the course of your playthrough, and there are both moments of gut-wrenching bleakness and sheer absurdity. It&#39;s in a league of its own, blending a multitude of horrors — survival horror, cosmic horror, body horror, psychological horror — and captivating artwork (not to mention an S-tier soundtrack) into a gripping RPG that has enough substance to justify playing it again and again. — Cheyenne MacDonald, Weekend EditorLonely Mountains: Snow RidersMost games involving mountains are about a heroic climb. Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders is about a series of humbling descents. This is a physics-driven downhill skiing game that, like its predecessor, starts you at the top of various summits and tasks you with racing to the goal in one piece. The way down is filled with interweaving routes and shortcuts, but there are no directional markers to guide you. Nor is there any music to pump you up, just the sounds of skis cutting into powder, winds whipping, birds chirping, nature being nature. The result is a game that pits you against yourself. You rush down to beat a target time, but you’re always fighting gravity and cold, hard earth. So you crash, again and again, until you manage to survive that one clean run. The mountain becomes something to respect, not conquer. It’s fast, thrilling and total slapstick: Steering your low-poly, literally blockheaded avatar into a tree or off a cliff is always good for a laugh. (Seeing others do it in multiplayer is even better.) It’s also gorgeous, all glistening snow, intimate sounds and serene vistas. More than an enjoyably tense sports game, Snow Riders is a vivid expression of our relationship with nature. Think of it like a more contemplative SSX. — J.D.Metroid Prime 4: BeyondMetroid Prime 4: Beyond is not a perfect game. The story barely hangs together at times, the addition of a squad of companions can really disrupt the atmospheric isolation the series is known for, there are a few unfair difficulty ramps and the open-world desert is a bit of a slog. And yet, it also does so many things right. As with most Metroid games, there are varying biomes to explore, each with a distinct identity and various flora and fauna that do not like intruders. As with most Nintendo games, the design of these levels are excellent across the board, with clever challenges and puzzles that reward continued exploration.But for me, seeing a Metroid Prime game in 4K was worth the price of admission alone. Beyond doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but it presents an absolutely gorgeous and immersive spectacle the likes of which we haven’t seen in a Metroid game before. Given that Metroid Prime 3: Corruption came out in 2007 on the Wii, a console that maxed out at 480p, seeing the series’ impeccable art style brought to life on modern hardware was a delight. It may have some issues, but Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is still worth experiencing.— N.I.Ninja Gaiden RageboundI&#39;d somehow never played a single Ninja Gaiden game until this year, but I could hardly have had a better introduction to the series. The Game Kitchen&#39;s Ninja Gaiden Ragebound is an old-school, hack-and-slash platformer with top-notch pixel art, an excellent score and slick level design.The combat helps ensure that everything hangs together. Dual protagonists Kinji Monzu and Kumori (whose souls fuse together) have distinct abilities that work in harmony, and using the right tools to tackle each enemy helps charge up a powerful hyper attack. Ragebound isn&#39;t necessarily easy, but it isn&#39;t frustrating either — unless you&#39;re trying to put it down and do something else, because this is a very absorbing, entertaining game.— K.H. PeakPeak perfectly captures the delightful, simultaneous disasters that can happen when multiple people make stupid decisions at the same time. Ostensibly a multiplayer game about child scouts who crash land on a deserted island and are forced to climb to the top of a mountain to get rescued, Peak&#39;s multitude of dangerous biomes, status-affecting consumables and hidden secrets make it fun to get you and your friends killed. The game is an awkward first-person platformer where it&#39;s sometimes easier to shoot someone out of a cannon than it is to get them to toddle up a hill, but those obstacles feel good to overcome because the game lets you talk to people while you do it. The term &#34;friendslop&#34; was coined following the popularity of Peak and games like it, a burgeoning micro-genre where games with deceptively simple virtual tasks are paired with proximity-based voice chat. Unsurprisingly, it&#39;s fun to play video games with your friends, but Peak stands out because the ongoing support of developers Aggro Crab and Landfall has managed to keep things interesting in the game for nearly half the year.— I.C.C.Oblivion RemasterThere&#39;s a comfort in knowing exactly what you&#39;re going to get from a game. The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered delivers all the things I love about Bethesda creations. It&#39;s a world I want to get lost in, where the detours are the true point of the journey. I become a stealth archer cat person who can cause chaos or save the day. And I can enjoy the studio&#39;s signature open-world RPG experience without suffering through the wonky design ideas that made the original game frustrating. For Bethesda fans, this remaster is a joy whether it&#39;s your first time playing Oblivion or your fiftieth.— A.W.ÖooI have a deep appreciation for games that give you a limited set of tools and many ways to use them. Puzzle-platformer Öoo is a brilliantly constructed example of that. It&#39;s so thoughtfully crafted that even the name is perfect. The large Ö looks like the caterpillar character you control and the smaller characters resemble the two bombs that you drag around and use to solve a variety of conundrums. Öoo is also the noise I involuntarily made when I solved some of the puzzles.Nama Takahashi (who made Öoo with help from Tiny Cactus Studio and Tsuyomi) uses deeply clever level design to teach you how to use the bombs and move forward. Takahashi clearly wants you to succeed. Checkpoints are everywhere, so if you die while trying to find a puzzle solution, there&#39;s no lengthy runback to worry about. The developer (who previously created ElecHead) even made his own walkthrough video to help you get to the end.Öoo — which you can complete in a single sitting — respects your time. It looks and sounds wonderful too. The music reminds me a lot of the outstanding Poinpy. While I remain sad that it&#39;s not currently possible to play that game, I&#39;m more than happy to have Öoo to return to.— K.H.SilksongIt’s such a relief to know that, finally, this is probably the last time I’ll write about Silksong. (Oh no, more is coming.) Seven years in the making, from DLC to standalone game to Reddit meme, Silksong arrived across pretty much every mainstream gaming platform. The Hollow Knight sequel swaps to a new protagonist, Hornet, who was a recurring boss in the original. She’s faster, she can attack in diagonal dives, and just plays pretty differently from the Knight. Off the back of the slowburn hit of Hollow Knight, Team Cherry have lavished more attention, more fun and more diverse boss battles, ensuring this feels like a better (although possibly more challenging) game. I prefer the faster, risk-and-reward playstyle too. Hornet uses silk to heal, which, like soul in Hollow Knight, you build up by attacking enemies. However, Hornet does this in bulk, healing three hearts at once. When you die, you’ll leave a bounty of silk behind, making for a tempting health top-up you can grab mid-boss fight. If you don’t die before then. You can equip Hornet with different weapon and subweapon loadouts, adding a little more variety in this sequel. Heavy, slower weapon swings, or relentless strikes with a much shorter range? Your choice.When it launched, half the Engadget team were sharing tales of bottlenecks and seemingly impossible boss fights, and we were all exploring the world of Silksong in entirely different directions. That’s the blessing and the curse of a Hollow Knight game. — Mat Smith, UK Bureau ChiefSilent Hill fIt’s a rare and special thing when a horror game lives up to the gruesome promises of its cinematic teaser trailer, and Silent Hill f accomplishes this and more. Silent Hill f is a heart-pounding survival-horror game set in a rural Japanese village in the 1960s and starring Hinako, a high school student with crappy friends and a tormented home life. Hinako’s town is ravaged by demonic creatures and an infectious botanical fungus, and she has to fight her way through it, shifting among realities and encountering a cast of untrustworthy peers and fox worshippers. The combat starts out great and only gets better as Hinako sacrifices her flesh in the name of salvation, meaning the body horror steadily ramps up as the game progresses. Hinako’s world is filled with terrifying mannequin minions, bulbous pus monsters and disturbing, trypophobic visuals. It’s beautiful.— J.C.Subway BuilderSubway Builder is an indie transport sim like no other. Creator Colin Miller combined OpenStreet maps of large cities with government data about where people live and work. This creates a complex web of nodes representing residents and workplaces for you to connect. You’ll start with no public transport infrastructure and try to build out a profitable network. In dense cities like New York this is incredibly easy, but freeing even 20 percent of Phoenix&#39;s endless sprawl from cars without going bust is very challenging. The game scratches the same itch for me as Mini Metro, only instead of cutesy vector graphics you&#39;re basically working in Google Maps. It&#39;s also expanding at a rapid pace: When I first played in October, there were maybe 15 locations, and as of writing there are now 29 US cities and, most recently, five UK options. I spent the first 35 years of my life bouncing around Croydon and Lewisham in London; giving South Londoners a proper tube network (while ignoring anything north of Highbury) has been a real treat.— A.S. Sword of the SeaWhile the game might always be evoked in the same breath as Journey, the PlayStation classic with which it shares a key creative, Sword of the Sea is more than just another beautiful trek towards a mountain. Combining delectable traversal mechanics from The Pathless and beautiful sea creatures like those in Abzu, the game is a culmination of everything developer Giant Squid is good at. More importantly, though, Sword of the Sea&#39;s surfing mechanic just looks and feels damn cool.I don&#39;t know that I ever mastered how to surf on a sword during Sword of the Sea&#39;s silent and surprisingly brief narrative, but I do know it didn&#39;t take long to care. Carving through sand and snow immediately came easy enough that getting to any of the game&#39;s intriguing landmarks and collectibles was a matter of how, not if. That&#39;s not to discredit the game&#39;s other charms, like a score from Austin Wintory and a photo mode that&#39;s perfect for capturing close encounters with dolphins, whales and sharks. If you need a reason to play Sword of the Sea, though, let it be the surfing. It tells you more about the game and what it wants you to feel than any piece of dialogue could.— I.C.C. Sworn Let&#39;s get one thing out of the way. Yes, Sworn is a Hades clone, but it&#39;s a darned good one. This game swaps out the Olympian gods for characters sourced from Arthurian legend, but the nuts and bolts gameplay is pretty much the same. So why was this one of my favorite games in a year when Hades 2 set the world on fire? The combat is extremely addictive and there are multiple character classes that truly change how everything plays. Some characters are for up close combat and others are better at dropping turrets and related items that do damage over time. It&#39;s super fun to litter a bunch of poison-soaked cannons in a level and just let them do their thing. It also has four-player co-op, which is chaotic in all the best ways. The story is totally forgettable when compared to Hades, but that&#39;s not why I play roguelites. — L.B. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/engadgets-favorite-games-of-2025-153000109.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2Fgotycollage2025.jpg&resize=1400%2C823&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=ee3a5a98f10baa5b074c807e74e836093c2b2e11,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/engadgets-favorite-games-of-2025-153000109.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-19T15:30:00Z,9,Tech

A total League of Legends revamp is coming in 2027,"Riot Games has confirmed that it’s working on a massive update for League of Legends after Bloomberg published a report saying that the company has plans to remake the game. Back in November, a Chinese esports insider also reported that a League of Legends 2 is in development and is coming as early as the second half of 2026. In a video announcement discussing Riot’s plans for League after 2026, executive producer Paul Belleza denied that the developer is working on League 2 like rumors have been suggesting, but he admitted that  it is working on a big update that will arrive in 2027. Andrei van Roon, Head of League Studio, then enumerated some of the things his team is already working on, including a brand new around-game client that’s fully integrated with the in-game experience, a full visual overhaul of the Summoner’s Rift, changes to Runes and an overall improvement to the player experience. The update is looking to be as big as the one from back in the mid-2010s when Riot reworked League’s graphics and is meant to bring in new players. Belleza and van Roon said they’ll share more details between MSI in the summer and Worlds in the fall of 2026. While the timeline is pretty vaugue, the window of release for a major update like this is most likely the end of November until early January when competitive league is on break.

Pick up the Samsung P9 microSD Express card for Switch 2 while it's down to a record low,"It was a big day in gaming history when Nintendo finally released its Switch sequel. But the Nintendo Switch 2 lacked many options for microSD Express cards. Samsung helped change that this fall, with the release of its P9 Express series of microSD Express cards, and now one of them is on sale. 
Currently, you can pick up the 256GB Samsung P9 Express microSD Express Card for $33, down from $55. The 40 percent discount brings the microSD down to a new all-time low price. That means your new Nintendo Switch 2 gets a lot more memory with transfer speeds reaching 800MB/s. The specs are on par with some of our other favorite microSD cards for the Nintendo Switch 2.  

  
Samsung&#39;s new microSD also comes with the company&#39;s Dynamic Thermal Guard, which should keep things from heating up too much during gameplay. It also works with devices other than the Switch 2, including other gaming consoles, computers, Steam Deck, cameras and more.

OpenAI just launched an app store inside ChatGPT
Some use locally stored data, and others let you organize Apple Music songs.

OpenAI has introduced an app directory right inside ChatGPT. The new apps section (on iOS, Android and web) divides into Feature, Lifestyle and Productivity categories, letting you connect to commonly used apps and even websites like Booking.com, Spotify and Dropbox.
With Dropbox, for instance, you can “gather insights, prepare briefs and summarize reports or internal documents,” using ChatGPT’s smarts, according to the description. OpenAI says developers can only monetize apps by linking out from the ChatGPT app to a native app or website, but the company is exploring internal monetization options as well.

A Starlink satellite just exploded and left 'trackable' debris,"SpaceX said it experienced an anomaly with one if its Starlink satellites that was likely caused by a small explosion. &#34;The anomaly led to venting of the propulsion tank, a rapid decay in semi-major axis by about 4 km [2.5 miles] and the release of a small number of trackable low relatively velocity objects,&#34; Starlink wrote in a post on X. Orbital tracking company LeoLabs assessed that the issue was caused by an &#34;internal energetic source rather than a collision with space debris or another object.&#34; 
SpaceX said it&#39;s working with NASA and the US Space Force to track the remains of the object. &#34;The satellite is largely intact, tumbling and will reenter the Earth&#39;s atmosphere and fully demise within weeks,&#34; the company said. It&#39;s trajectory is well below the International Space Station (ISS) so it poses no risk to the lab or its crew. Starlink has yet to say how many pieces it&#39;s tracking.
The incident happened just days after a Starlink satellite narrowly avoided a collision with a rival Chinese satellite from CAS Space last week. Starlink vice president Michael Nicholls said that the incident happened due to a lack of coordination between the two companies. &#34;When satellite operators do not share emphemeris for their satellites, dangerously close approaches can occur in space,&#34; he wrote on X. 
Starlink&#39;s constellation consists of almost 9,300 active satellites making up around 65 percent of all orbiting spacecraft, not including defunct units. That number grew by more than 3,000 this year alone, launched aboard 121 separate SpaceX missions — around one every three days. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/a-starlink-satellite-just-exploded-and-left-trackable-debris-120002814.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F6dc60190-dcc0-11f0-b767-6529e943ff0a&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=96f265af1d67cf7c7cb2addba121ede0babd55f8,https://www.engadget.com/science/space/a-starlink-satellite-just-exploded-and-left-trackable-debris-120002814.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-19T12:00:02Z,7,Tech

Attackers bring their own passwords to Cisco and Palo Alto VPNs,"
		
					  
						




Security researchers have flagged a coordinated credential-based campaign targeting VPN authentication endpoints from Cisco and Palo Alto Networks.



Over just two days in mid-December, attackers launched large-scale automated login attempts against Cisco’s SSL VPN and Palo Alto Networks’ GlobalProtect services.



A GreyNoise analysis noted that the campaign does not exploit software bugs, but instead relies on churning through username and password combos at scale.“Consistent infrastructure usage and timing indicate a single campaign pivoting across multiple VPN platforms,” the researchers said in a blog post.



GreyNoise confirmed millions of login sessions across more than 10,000 unique attacking IP addresses, pointing to a highly scripted and centralized campaign. It also clarified it has no evidence connecting the activity to the recent campaign targeting Cisco Secure Email Gateway and Secure Email and Web Manager.



Palo Alto portals hit with a wave of login traffic



GreyNoise reported a spike in automated login traffic targeting Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect portals on December 11. Over a 16-hour window, roughly 1.7 million sessions were observed hitting emulated GlobalProtect and PAN-OS login endpoints.



“Emulated” refers to decoy or simulated VPN login pages that GreyNoise runs, not real customer VPNs.



The targeted portals were geographically distributed, primarily in the United States, Pakistan, and Mexico, with the traffic almost exclusively originating from IP space linked to a single German hosting provider, 3xk GmbH. The login attempts followed a highly uniform pattern, reusing common usernames and passwords and even adopting a browser-like Firefox user agent string.



This is a telltale sign of scripted credential probes rather than opportunistic scanning, the researchers noted.



“This consistency of the user agent, request structure, and timing suggests scripted credential probing designed to identify exposed or weakly protected GlobalProtect portals, rather than interactive access attempts or vulnerability exploitation,” they said.



Brute-forcing Cisco’s SSL VPN follows



Just a day after the GlobalProtect surge, the same actor infrastructure pivoted to Cisco’s SSL VPN endpoints, with the same TCP fingerprint and hosting provider IP space. GreyNoise saw the number of unique attacking IPs jump from a typical daily baseline of fewer than 200 to over 1200, signalling a sharp rise in brute-force login attempts.



Unlike the more structured GlobalProtect activity, much of the Cisco traffic hit vendor-agnostic facade sensors. This indicated that attackers were probing broadly rather than holding a finely targeted list of known endpoints.



However, the underlying behavior remained automated credential-based authentication attempts.



GreyNoise disclosure urges defenders to harden authentication hygiene, including enforcing strong passwords and multi-factor authentication (MFA), auditing exposed edge devices for unexpected login attempts, and leveraging threat intel blocklists to filter out malicious IPs at the perimeter. The disclosure shared blocklists for its platform customers as well as non-GreyNoise users.

The best DACs for Apple Music Lossless in 2026,"If you want to hear Apple Music’s lossless catalog the way it was meant to sound, you will need a little extra hardware. iPhones and most wireless headphones still have limitations when it comes to high-resolution audio, which means a good DAC can make a real difference in clarity and detail. Whether you listen through wired earbuds, studio headphones or a home speaker setup, the right DAC can bring out far more texture in your music.Lossless audio can be confusing at first, especially with different formats and file sizes to consider, but you do not need a complicated setup to enjoy it. Many DACs work across iOS, Android, Mac and Windows, and several are small enough to carry every day. In this guide, we picked the best DACs for Apple Music so you can upgrade your listening experience without wasting money on gear you do not need. 
Best DACs for 2026 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  
DAC FAQs 
What does DAC stand for? 
DAC stands for digital to analogue converter. A digital-to-analog converter takes the digital (D) music from your phone or computer and converts (C) it into analog (A) sound you can hear. All phones and PCs have them, but since handsets moved to USB-C, Lightning or Bluetooth for music, the task of converting that signal was generally outsourced to either your adapter or your wireless headphones. 
DACs can be used with phones, laptops and desktops but tend to be much simpler than a regular external audio interface. One basic distinction is that DACs are usually for listening only whereas an audio interface might have ports to plug in microphones and instruments (but an external audio interface is also technically a DAC). Some high-end DACs even include XLR outputs for better connectivity with professional audio equipment. 
The best DACs tend to be lightweight, making them more suitable for mobile use, although it still gets a little tricky with the iPhone as you still might need to add another dongle to make it play nice with Lightning. Also, not all DACs support all the higher audio resolutions like DSD. Most standalone DACs require external power or an onboard battery, though some can use the power from whatever you plug them into — in which case expect a hit to your battery life. 
Why do I need new hardware to listen to music? 
The short answer is, you don’t. You can play “hi-res” audio files on most phones and PCs, you just might not be getting the full experience. If your device’s audio interface tops out at 44.1 or 48kHz (which is fairly common and covers the vast majority of music online) then that’s the experience you’ll get. If you want to enjoy better sounding music at a higher sample rate and bit-depth (aka resolution), you’ll need an interface that supports it and wired headphones, potentially using a headphone amp for an enhanced experience. 
It’s worth pointing out that “lossless” and “hi-res” are related terms, but not the same thing and will vary from service to service. Apple uses ALAC encoding which is compressed, but without “loss” to the quality (unlike the ubiquitous .aac or .mp3 file formats). CDs were generally mastered to at least 16-bit / 44.1kHz which is the benchmark that Apple is using for its definition of lossless. In audio circles, a general consensus is that hi-res is anything with a sample rate above 44.1kHz. Increasingly, though, the term is being used for anything 96kHz and above. 
This, of course, isn’t only about Apple’s new streaming formats. External DACs and audio interfaces are a great way to get the best sound and upgrade your listening experience generally. Especially if you want to get into the world of more exotic (read: pricey) headphones, as they often even require a DAC to provide enough clean digital signal to drive them. For audiophile headphones, a phone or laptop’s internal sound chipset often doesn’t have the oomph needed to deliver a hi-fi experience, meaning a better DAC could make all the difference in sound quality. 

 
 
 
Okay, but can’t I just use the headphone adapter for my phone? 
No. Well, yes, but see above. A Lightning or USB-C to 3.5mm headphone adapter often is an audio interface and most of the ones you’re buying for $7 (or that come free in the box) do not support hi-res audio beyond 48kHz / 24-bit. Android is a little more complicated, as some adapters are “passive” and really just connect you to the phone’s internal DAC like old school headphones. Others (active ones) have a DAC built-in and good luck finding out what your specific phone and the in-box adapter delivers. (Hint: connect it to a PC and see if it comes up as an audio interface. You might find some details there if it does). 
What about Bluetooth headphones? 
Chances are that over the last few years you’ve migrated from wired to wireless headphones (thanks, Apple). The world of Bluetooth headphones changes things a little when it comes to seeking better audio performance. What matters here is twofold, the headphones you’re using (as those will technically be the “DAC”) and the codec — the method used to send the musical data over to the headphones. 
It’s also worth checking to see if your headphones support aptX and which version. Look out for aptX HD, aptX Adaptive and (for the highest quality) aptX Lossless which are all better than standard and becoming more common, albeit slowly. It’s worth noting that both your phone or media player and your headphones need to support the same aptX codec. Currently, no iPhone supports any type of aptX, though dongles exist that will offer that functionality. 
Other higher-resolution Bluetooth codecs exist, like Sony’s LDAC, but Qualcomm’s AptX has wider support thanks to its prevalence in Android devices. Some high-end wireless headphones might even come with a headphone jack for wired connections when higher-quality audio is needed.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/the-best-dac-for-lossless-high-resolution-music-iphone-android-160056147.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F237a8e10-d44d-11f0-96af-8746b1d02d71&resize=1400%2C840&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=f469ff705eeabdc9c1b7929033926c51740d70ec,https://www.engadget.com/audio/the-best-dac-for-lossless-high-resolution-music-iphone-android-160056147.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-19T10:00:37Z,9,Tech

Managing agentic AI risk: Lessons from the OWASP Top 10,"
		
					  
						




LLM-powered chatbots have risks that we see playing out in the headlines on a nearly daily basis. But chatbots are limited to answering questions. AI agents, however, access data and tools and carry out tasks, making them infinitely more capable – and more dangerous to enterprises.



The OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications can help CISOs explain what the issues are to their business counterparts. It can also help CISOs to directly improve agentic AI security, because it comes with threats taxonomy, mitigation strategies and playbooks, and example threat models.



It’s all part of OWASP’s Agentic Security Initiative. Scott Clinton, OWASP GenAI security project board co-chair and co-founder, says he was surprised by how many agentic solutions were already deployed in organizations that the OWASP team uncovered while they were researching the list. And how many of those solutions were deployed without the knowledge of IT and security teams.



This level of risk is unprecedented, he says. That includes a lot of theoretical, “academic” risks.



“However, we focused on those that were data-driven,” he says. “Where we would provide practical guidance based on real-world conditions today.”



The challenge of educating stakeholders



“If you’re a CSO, chances are you are having quite a time educating your stakeholders about the risks that are being introduced by the use cases that are probably being pushed on you,” says Kayla Underkoffler, director of AI security and policy advocacy at Zenity, an AI security company, and one of the core contributors to the OWASP list.



The CISO might not be able to say no, she adds – but might also be a little hesitant to say that the company can go all in and adopt the technology without thinking of the consequences.



The list was deliberately designed to be consumable, she says. “It will help with threat modeling, help with telling the story, help explain what controls need to be in place to reduce the risk and why.”



A security leader can get an agentic AI use case from the business and align the top risks to fit that use case. The list also provides a common language around agentic AI and its risks, Underkoffler says.



Actionable guidance



Agentic AI is the main topic of conversation in discussions among his peers, says Keith Hillis, VP of security engineering at Akamai Technologies.



“Most organizations are confronted with the challenge of balancing the promising power of AI while also ensuring the organization is not incurring increased security risk,” he says. So, the biggest value he finds in the new Agentic AI OWASP top 10 is that it’s immediately useful. “It’s directly actionable as a control baseline in both security architecture and governance, risk, and compliance contexts,” he says.



One aspect of the list that he found particularly insightful was the evolution of “least privilege” to “least agency.”



He recommends that CISOs use the list to assess their programs, identify gaps, and map out a plan of action for improvement. “Most likely already have active programs in place,” he says. But it’s also likely they will need to evolve to accommodate the specific risks of agentic AI.



Missing pieces



The only thing that’s lacking in this first release of the list is that some of the mitigation sections aren’t detailed enough, says Zenity’s Underkoffler.



But there are plans to address that. “We have some efforts to really dive into the mitigations for security teams, to help implement these controls,” she says. “Not just descriptions of what you should do but real code examples of how you can implement them.”



For example, she says, one of the suggested mitigations is to “apply the principle of least privilege”. “Which is completely accurate,” she says. “Everyone should apply the principle of least privilege. But what does that mean for agents?”



Rick Holland, data and AI security officer at Cyera, a data security vendor, says he’d like the list to explain the likelihood of each type of attack. “Not all threat actors are created equal,” he says.



For organizations targeted by nation-state actors, for example, the attackers might use more sophisticated attack vectors, like memory and context poisoning or agentic supply chain vulnerabilities. Rank-and-file cybercriminals might go after more low-hanging fruit, Holland says, using techniques like agent goal hijack or tool misuse.



Jose Lazu, associate director of product management at CMD+CTRL, a security training company, says that there are some second-tier risks that could have been included, such as model and tuning supply-chain integrity, long-horizon data poisoning, multi-agent coordination exploits, and cost-based resource exhaustion.



“These areas are evolving quickly, so CSOs need to keep them on their radar,” he says.



OWASP Top 10 for Agentic AI



Below we list the OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications 2026, a framework that identifies the most critical security risks facing autonomous and agentic AI systems.



1 – Agent Goal Hijack



Attackers use prompt injection, poisoned data, and other tactics to manipulate the AI agent’s goals, so that the agent carries out unwanted actions. For example, a malicious prompt can manipulate a financial agent into sending money to an attacker.



2 – Tool Misuse and Exploitation



Agents misuse legitimate, authorized tools for data exfiltration, destructive actions, and other unwanted behaviors. In fact, we’ve already seen examples of AI agents deleting databases and wiping hard drives.



3 – Identity and Privilege Abuse



Flaws in agent identity, delegation, or privilege inheritance allow attackers to escalate access, exploit confused deputy scenarios, or execute unauthorized actions across systems. For example, an attacker can use a low-privilege AI agent to relay instructions to a high-privilege in order to do things they’re not supposed to be able to do.



4 – Agentic Supply Chain Vulnerabilities



Compromised or malicious third-party agents, tools, models, interfaces, or registries introduce hidden instructions or unsafe behavior into agentic ecosystems. For example, an attacker can embed hidden instructions into a tool’s meta-data.



5 – Unexpected Code Execution



Agent-generated or agent-invoked code executes in unintended or adversarial ways, leading to host, container, or environment compromise. AI agents can generate code on the fly, bypassing normal software controls, and attackers can leverage this. For example, a coding agent writing a security patch might include a hidden back door due to poisoned training data or adversarial prompts.



6 – Memory and Context Poisoning



Attackers corrupt persistent agent memory, RAG stores, embeddings, or shared context to affect an agent’s future actions. For example, an attacker keeps mentioning a fake price for a product, which gets stored into an agent’s memory, and the agent might later think the price is valid and approves bookings at that price.



Contaminated context and shared memory can spread between agents, compounding corruption.



7 – Insecure Inter-Agent Communication



Weak authentication, integrity, or semantic validation in agent-to-agent messaging enables spoofing, tampering, replay, or manipulation. For example, an attacker can register a fake agent in a discovery service, and intercept privileged coordination traffic.



8 – Cascading Failures



A single fault, such as hallucination, poisoned memory, or compromised tool, propagates across autonomous agents. For example, a regional outage in a hyperscaler can break multiple AI services, leading to a cascade of agent failures across many organizations.



9 – Human-Agent Trust Exploitation



Agents exploit human trust, authority bias, or automation bias to influence decisions or extract sensitive information. For example, a compromised IT support agent can request credentials from an employee and send them to the attacker.



10 – Rogue Agents



Agents can act harmfully and deceptively in such a way that individual actions may appear legitimate. This could be due to prompt injection, or due to conflicting objectives or reward hacking. For example, an agent whose job is to reduce cloud costs might figure out that deleting files is the most efficient way to do that.

React2Shell is the Log4j moment for front end development,"
		
					  
						




Attackers have upped the ante in their exploits of a recently-disclosed maximum severity vulnerability in React Server Components (RSC), Next.js, and related frameworks.



Financially-motivated attackers have found a way to use the flaw, dubbed React2Shell (CVE-2025-55182), to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable servers through a single malicious HTTP request. This allows them to quickly and easily gain access to a corporate network and deploy ransomware, according to researchers at cybersecurity company S-RM and the Microsoft Defender Security Research Team.



Attackers initially exploited the vulnerability to introduce backdoor malware and crypto miners; this new method represents an escalation, and experts say it reveals a fundamental security flaw in front end development.



“For too long, we’ve treated front end development as low end, low risk work,” said David Shipley of Beauceron Security. “This is to front end of applications what Log4j was to the back end, a massive opportunity for attackers.”



How attackers easily get ‘highly privileged’ access



React is widely used in enterprise environments, with Microsoft researchers identifying “tens of thousands of distinct devices across several thousand organizations” running React or React-based applications.



React2Shell is a pre-authentication remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability affecting React Server Components (RSC), the open-source framework Next.js, and other related frameworks. It has been rated a 10 on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) because it is easy to exploit, puts numerous exposed systems at risk, and is highly susceptible to automated attacks since it doesn’t require authentication to execute.



The vulnerability specifically impacts the Flight protocol, a core feature in the React development library and Next.js. RSC contains packages, frameworks, and bundlers that allow React apps to run parts of their logic on the server rather than in the browser.



Flight allows server and client to communicate; when the client requests data, the server receives and parses a payload, executes server-side logic, and returns a human-readable software package.



With the React2Shell vulnerability, impacted RSCs fail to validate incoming payloads, allowing threat actors to inject malicious components that React identifies as legitimate. Attackers can send HTTP requests to trick the server into running compromised code, potentially giving them “highly privileged” access to unpatched systems, according to the S-RM researchers.



According to initial reporting on React2Shell, nation-state actors began exploiting the vulnerability within hours of public disclosure. While early impact was limited to the installation of persistent backdoors into networks and crypto currency mining, React2Shell is now being used as the initial access vector in a ransomware attack.



S-RM notes that it is likely being used by “less sophisticated actors” targeting public-facing web servers.



The Microsoft researchers warn of the dangers of this vulnerability: It can be exploited with just one HTTP request; default configurations are vulnerable, meaning there’s no special setup and attackers don’t have to wait for user mistakes; exploitation doesn’t require authentication because it occurs pre-authentication; and proof-of-concept exploits show near-100% reliability.



“For all the over-talk on zero trust, here’s a great example of where it would’ve been useful,” said Beauceron’s Shipley. “Way too much trust and access was built into the React model. And attackers figured out how to exploit it.”



What to look for



In an attack tracked by S-RM, immediately after the threat actor gained access to a targeted company’s network, they ran a hidden PowerShell command, establishing command and control (C2) by downloading a Cobalt Strike PowerShell stager, a tactic regularly used by red teamers, and installing a beacon to allow them to communicate with their external servers. They then disabled real-time protection in Windows Defender Antivirus.



The ransomware binary was dropped and executed “within less than one minute of initial access,” the S-RM researchers report. The attackers modified encrypted files, left recovery notes, created text files that included the target’s public IP address, and cleared event logs and backup snapshots.



The researchers noted that they did not observe lateral movement to other systems or attempts to steal data. The compromised server was taken down the day after it was discovered.



S-RM advises enterprises using RSC to verify that it is a fully-patched version; however, React has warned that even initially released patches (versions 19.0.2, 19.1.3, and 19.2.2) are vulnerable.



Beyond patching, organizations should perform forensic reviews to check for:




Unusual outbound connections that could indicate C2 was executed;



Disabling of antivirus and endpoint protection, or log clearing or tampering;



Unusual spikes in resource use, which could indicate crypto miners;



Windows event logs or endpoint detection and response (EDR) telemetry indicating attackers executed files in memory from binaries related to Node or React.



Indicators of compromise (IOC) detailed in the advisory, both host-based and network-based.




Front end is no longer low-risk



This vulnerability reveals a fundamental gap in the development environment that has largely been overlooked, experts say.



“There is a dangerous comforting lie we tell ourselves in web development: ‘The frontend is safe.’ It isn’t,” notes web engineer Louis Phang. He called this a “logic error in the way modern servers talk to clients,” that turns a standard web request into a weapon. It is the result of developers focusing on reliability, scalability, and maintainability, rather than security.



For years, all that happened when a front end developer made a mistake was that a button that looked wrong, a layout was broken, or, in a worst-case scenario, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), which allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages, was possible, Phang said. With React rendering on the server, front end code has privileged access, and vulnerabilities serve as a backdoor into databases, keys, and data.



“React2Shell signifies the end of the front end developer as a low-risk role,” Phang contended.



Beauceron’s Shipley agreed, noting that the need for server-side heavy lifting changed the risk, but the tech stack didn’t respond accordingly.



“First, we had confusion about whether it was severe or not, then some were downplaying how much exploitation would happen, and now we’re in a feeding frenzy,” he said.



It’s concerning how long it’s taking to rouse the technology environment to deal with this threat; it could ultimately be a side effect of cuts to security teams and budgets and developer burnout, he noted.



“This is a concerning trend heading into 2026, which will be even more intense for zero days thanks to AI,” Shipley predicted.

Sony is buying Peanuts,"Sony is paying approximately $460 milliion to purchase Peanuts [PDF] and its characters, including Snoopy and Charlie Brown, created by Charles M. Schulz. That’s a 41 percent stake Sony is buying from Canadian firm WildBrain. Since Sony bought 39 percent of the franchise back in 2018, this will give the company an 80 percent stake. The deal is still subject to regulatory approvals, but Peanuts will become Sony’s consolidated subsidiary once it’s closed. Schulz’s family still owns the remaining 20 percent stake in the franchise. Schulz launched the Peanuts universe in comic strips 75 years ago, back in 1950. The franchise has grown massively since then, spawning animated series, cartoon musicals and movies that made Snoopy a household name. The company said that it has focused on expanding the Peanuts IP since it bought 39 percent of the brand years ago. “With this additional ownership stake, we are thrilled to be able to further elevate the value of the ʻPEANUTSʼ brand by drawing on the Sony Groupʼs extensive global network and collective expertise,” Sony Music Entertainment Japan CEO Shunsuke Muramatsu added.

HPE OneView vulnerable to remote code execution attack,"
		
					  
						




A maximum severity remote code execution vulnerability in Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) OneView network and systems management suite is “bad” and needs to be patched immediately, says a cybersecurity expert.



“Vendors typically downplay the severity of a vulnerability,” says Curtis Dukes, executive VP for security best practices at the Center for Internet Security, “but HPE did not – it’s a 10.”



The vulnerability is remotely executable by an unauthenticated user, he added, and it impacts every recent version of the suite. On top of that, he pointed out, OneView is a central manager of IT infrastructure in organizations.



“For these reasons, the patch should be implemented immediately,” Dukes said.  “Adversaries, nation-state, and criminal gangs alike know there is a window of opportunity and are likely working on an exploit.”



HPE says in its advisory that the vulnerability, CVE-2025-37164, affects all versions between 5.20 and 10.20.  It can be resolved by applying a security hotfix, which must be reapplied after an appliance upgrade from HPE OneView version 6.60.xx to 7.00.00, as well as after any HPE Synergy Composer reimage.



HPE offers separate hotfixes for HPE OneView virtual appliance and HPE Synergy Composer.



The advisory adds that any third party security patches that are to be installed on systems running HPE software products should be applied in accordance with the customer’s patch management policy.



Asked for comment, an HPE spokesperson said the company has nothing to say beyond its advisory, other than to urge admins to download and install the patches as soon as possible.



Jack Bicer, director of vulnerability research at Action1, said that because this vulnerability can be exploited without authentication or any user interaction, it is “an extremely severe security issue. There are no available workarounds, so the patch should be applied immediately. Until the patch can be applied, restrict network access to the OneView management interface to trusted administrative networks only.”



HPE describes OneView as a solution that simplifies infrastructure lifecycle management across compute storage and networking through a unified API. It allows admins to create a catalogue of workload-optimized infrastructure templates so more general IT staff can rapidly and reliably provision resources. These templates can quickly provision physical, virtual, and containerized systems, setting up BIOS settings, local RAID configuration, firmware baseline, shared storage and more. HPE says software-defined intelligence allows IT to run multiple applications simultaneously with repeatable templates that ensure high reliability, consistency, and control. The vendor also says the embedded automation speeds provisioning and lowers operating expenses.



The most recent major vulnerability in OneView was revealed in June: CVE-2025-37101, a local elevation of privilege issue which relates specifically to OneView for VMware vCenter. If exploited, an attacker with read only privilege could upgrade their access to allow them to perform admin actions.

Trump's TikTok deal is another step closer to finally actually happening,"Remember back in September when President Donald Trump signed an executive order that seemingly finalized some of the terms of a deal to spin off TikTok&#39;s US business? Three months later, that same deal is apparently one step closer to being official.According to Bloomberg, TikTok CEO Shou Chew told employees that TikTok and ByteDance had signed off the agreement for control of TikTok&#39;s US business. It sounds like terms of the deal are roughly the same as what Trump announced earlier this year. A group of US investors, including Oracle, Silver Lake and MGX will control a majority of the new entity while ByteDance will keep a smaller stake in the venture. According to Chew&#39;s memo, the deal is expected to close January 22, 2026. “Upon the closing, the US joint venture, built on the foundation of the current TikTok US Data Security (USDS) organization, will operate as an independent entity with authority over US data protection, algorithm security, content moderation and software assurance,” he wrote according to Bloomberg.  TikTok didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Notably, it&#39;s still not clear where Chinese officials stand on the deal. Trump said back in September that China was &#34;fully on board,&#34; but subsequent meetings between the two sides have so far produced vague statements. In October, China&#39;s Commerce Ministry said it would &#34;work with the U.S. to properly resolve issues related to TikTok.&#34; If a deal is indeed finalized by next month, it will come almost exactly a year after Trump&#39;s first executive order to delay a law that required a sale or ban of the app front taking effect. He has signed off several other extensions since.

"Steam Winter Sale discounts Clair Obscur, Silent Hill f and more","Holiday shopping is in full swing, which means it&#39;s about time for the Steam Winter Sale. This go-around, Valve’s sale runs from December 18, 2025 through January 5, 2026, and includes discounts on some of this year&#39;s hit games, like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Silent Hill f and Assassin&#39;s Creed Shadows.Clair Obscur is available for $40, down from its normal $50, Silent Hill f is 40 percent off, bringing its price down to $42, and the normally $70 Assassin&#39;s Creed Shadows is selling for $35, a solid deal on what was somewhat of a comeback for the long-running Ubisoft series. On top of those sales, you can get Stardew Valley for $9, or the difficult-to-master walking sim Baby Steps for $13. I&#39;m also considering picking up Consume Me for $10 and Ball x Pit for $12, just to round out my collection of indie hits from 2025.Valve runs Steam sales on a pretty regular cadence, so if the game you&#39;re eyeing isn&#39;t on sale, there&#39;s a good chance it could be soon.

"AirTags are back on sale, with a four-pack retailing for $65","Apple keeps most of its product pricing on a tight leash, but we do see the company&#39;s AirTags go on sale pretty frequently. Another cost cut has come around for this item just in time for the holidays. Amazon is currently selling a four-pack of AirTags for $65. At a third off the regular cost, that price is pretty close to the record low discount of $63 we&#39;ve seen for these Bluetooth trackers.  

  
If you place an order quickly, the AirTags should arrive in time for Christmas, making this a solid choice as a gift for someone with a tendency to misplace stuff. AirTags can also be useful for people who travel frequently, helping you to keep track of essentials like your passport as well as a way to keep tabs on luggage while you&#39;re on the go. 
If you do purchase some AirTags, we have some recommendations for useful accessories to go along with them, such as different styles of cases to best attach the trackers to different types of items. These are worth looking over and adding to your shopping cart in order to make the most of the product.  
AirTags have an IP67 rating for water and dust resistance and their replaceable batteries should last for about a year. They can also support Precision Finding, which gives more exact directions to a lost item, when paired with most models after the iPhone 11. Up to five people can share an AirTag&#39;s location, which is helpful for families or large travel groups.

Auto chip shortage: Honda will pause production in Japan and China,"The ripples of the auto industry&#39;s chip shortage are still being felt, as evidenced by Honda. Bloomberg reported on Wednesday that the automaker will suspend production in Japan on January 5 and 6. (Honda didn&#39;t specify the affected factories.) In addition, all three of the automaker&#39;s Guangqi Honda Automobile plants in China will shut down from December 29 to January 2.The halt is an outgrowth of a chip shortage stemming from a recent geopolitical proxy war in the Netherlands, of all places. In October, the Dutch government, bowing to pressure from the Trump administration, seized control of the Chinese-owned chipmaker Nexperia. The company, which operates in the Netherlands, makes low-end chips that power automobiles, appliances and other tech.The Dutch government&#39;s official explanation for the seizure was that Nexperia had &#34;serious governance shortcomings.&#34; It cited a concern that Nexperia&#39;s Chinese majority owner, Wingtech, would move key technology out of Europe. However, the New York Times later reported that the Dutch government had known about those plans since 2019.Regardless, China retaliated by blocking exports of Nexperia-made chips. The Netherlands eventually suspended its intervention, following &#34;constructive talks.&#34; China then relaxed (but did not entirely remove) its restrictions through exemptions to export controls. The uneasy resolution hasn’t been enough to help supply chains fully recover.Honda initially anticipated that production would return to normal starting in late November. So much for that. &#34;No one [in the auto industry] prepared for geopolitical disruption,&#34; automaker consultant Ambrose Conroy, CEO of Seraph Consulting, told Reuters in November. &#34;And they&#39;re still not prepared.&#34;This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/auto-chip-shortage-honda-will-pause-production-in-japan-and-china-200857591.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2Fhonda.jpg&resize=1400%2C788&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=b90037c0710cc0ae0489c98d42b1870e16f5dea7,https://www.engadget.com/transportation/auto-chip-shortage-honda-will-pause-production-in-japan-and-china-200857591.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-18T20:08:57Z,7,Tech

The Displace Hub can make your normal TV wireless,"Displace first tried its hand at reimagining the TV in 2023, with a wireless screen that suctions onto walls and features built-in rechargeable batteries. At CES 2026, the company is not only introducing new versions of its own TVs, it&#39;s also showing off the Displace Hub, an accessory that can make other TVs wireless.The Displace Hub is a wall-mounting system with some extra bells and whistles. It combines the &#34;active-loop suction&#34; of Displace’s TVs, with a rechargeable battery that can power whatever screen you mount on it and a built-in PC that runs Displace&#39;s &#34;ambient computing platform.&#34; The Hub uses an Intel N-150 4-core CPU with an integrated GPU, 16GB RAM and 128GB of storage to run Displace&#39;s operating system, and includes a 15,000mAh battery to keep everything powered. The Hub also has two HDMI inputs for external devices and supports Displace&#39;s Controller 2.0, which offers a second screen for additional information and content.The Displace Hub uses the same &#34;active-loop suction&#34; system as the Displace TV.DisplaceThe mounting system does have some notable limits, however. Displace says the Hub can support weights up to 150 pounds, and is specifically designed to mount TVs between 55 and 100 inches, which might rule out the TV you already own. The battery life of the Displace Hub could also be a concern. Connecting your TV to the Hub&#39;s integrated battery is supposed to eliminate the need for unsightly power cables, but depending on how often you watch and the energy demands of your screen, you might be recharging fairly often. Displace says the Displace Hub&#39;s battery life lasts anywhere from five to 10 hours. While the Hub can be recharged while keeping your TV mounted at the same time, having to plug and unplug your TV setup from a charger seems like it could defeat the point of having a wireless TV in the first place.Other TV makers have tried to offer mostly wireless screens at CES in the past, like the LG Signature OLED M3 and the Samsung Neo QLED 8K QN990F, which use wireless breakout boxes to stream HDMI connections to their TV screens. Both of those TVs were focused on reducing the number of cables that you connect to your screen rather than eliminating cables entirely, though, a goal that still comes with tradeoffs based on the limitations of the Displace Hub. Displace hasn&#39;t announced a release date for the Displace Hub, but the company says that the mounting system will cost $1,900 at launch and will be available to pre-order during CES 2026.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/the-displace-hub-can-make-your-normal-tv-wireless-193837460.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2FDisplace-Hub.jpg&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=e285940e969ea8be5d2ba6e664b9e50198b2b36e,https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/the-displace-hub-can-make-your-normal-tv-wireless-193837460.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-18T19:38:37Z,7,Tech
Apple is bringing even more ads to the App Store,"Apple just announced it will be integrating more ads into the App Store because our poor eyeballs must be assaulted at all times. The company plans on littering search results with advertisements beginning next year.
Currently, the App Store only has one ad spot. That&#39;s at the very top of search results. If you search for something like Instagram it&#39;s likely that top spot will be filled with an ad for a rival social media platform. The new ads will appear further down the actual search results.
Apple says that advertisers won&#39;t have to alter their campaigns, as the ads will &#34;run in either the existing position — at the top of search results — or further down in search results.&#34; The company says that 65 percent of app downloads happen after a search, so this move will &#34;give advertisers more opportunities.&#34;
Google began inundating the Play Store with more ads last year and, well, the results haven&#39;t been pretty. The general consensus is that the store has become more frustrating to use. We&#39;ll have to wait and see just how intrusive these App Store ads end up being.
Recent reporting also indicates that Apple plans on bringing ads to the Maps app. This is reportedly scheduled for next year, though the company has yet to comment.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/apple-is-bringing-even-more-ads-to-the-app-store-193416921.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F886c2140-dc44-11f0-af5f-72baa770d1dc&resize=1400%2C914&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=a6b161d59455ff01133e8eb753351e8f69f5fb96,https://www.engadget.com/apps/apple-is-bringing-even-more-ads-to-the-app-store-193416921.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-18T19:34:16Z,7,Tech

"Trump Mobile's T1 still doesn't exist, but the company is now selling refurbished phones","The T1 smartphone from Trump Mobile remains non-existent vaporware, but the company is still finding new ways to take people&#39;s money. Anyone who desperately wants to fund this sham can now buy a refurbished phone from the company. The business&#39;s website has listings for &#34;Renewed&#34; models of the Samsung S24 and S23 and the iPhone 15 and 14. Gizmodo noticed that Trump Mobile is selling these other brands&#39; phones for the same cost, or sometimes more, than the same refurbs from other retailers. Seems pretty par for the course. NBC News opted to order one of the T1 phones in August to track its development. &#34;After confirming with the credit card company that the transaction was not fraudulent, NBC News received a confirmation email verifying the order,&#34; the publication said in a report last month. However, it has not received much communication from the company on why the phone still has not shipped. &#34;Neither Trump Mobile nor the Trump Organization responded to NBC News’ multiple requests for comment on when the phone would be released and why it’s delayed.&#34;In case you missed the previous acts of sketchiness from Trump Mobile, the company insisted at its debut that the phone was made in the US. That seemed like a dubious claim and the &#34;made in the USA&#34; language was quietly removed from the website shortly after.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/trump-mobiles-t1-still-doesnt-exist-but-the-company-is-now-selling-refurbished-phones-191740570.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2F2025-12%2Ff573273c-35fb-4a29-8861-a64f2cf6f2f2&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=483e62fffb9cddf568357fa7a38456c84c3f103c,https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/trump-mobiles-t1-still-doesnt-exist-but-the-company-is-now-selling-refurbished-phones-191740570.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-18T19:17:40Z,7,Tech

Trump Media is merging with a Google-backed fusion energy company in a deal worth $6 billion,"Trump media, the company behind the president&#39;s personal social media platform Truth Social, is inexplicably merging with a Google-backed fusion energy company called TAE Technologies. The deal is worth $6 billion, according to reporting by Financial Times.
Why is an entity known for publishing frenzied hot takes by the president at 3AM combining with a fusion energy company? Who the heck really knows, but a statement says the two organizations will join together to build the &#34;world&#39;s first utility-scale fusion power plant.&#34; This would be huge, if true, as there are currently no operational commercial nuclear fusion power plants.
📣TAE Technologies, a premier global fusion power company, to merge with Trump Media &amp; Technology Group to create one of the world’s first publicly traded fusion companies.Join our joint investor call at 9 am ET today to learn more: https://t.co/3ccBmMY5qrRead more:… pic.twitter.com/f7TYQS4jQp— TAE Technologies (@TAE) December 18, 2025
 


We know what TAE would bring to the table in that scenario. The energy company has been around since the 1990s and has attracted interest from Google, Chevron and others. Trump Media would be a great partner when building a reactor powered by insults, but doesn&#39;t seem to offer much of anything else.
The merger statement does mention that Trump Media would provide TAE with &#34;access to significant capital.&#34; The company lost $55 million last quarter, as there&#39;s only so much money in a social media platform primarily used by just one person.
However, the president himself is likely the world&#39;s most renowned raiser of funds when it comes to personal pet projects. He knows how to get a roomful of billionaires to open up their wallets, provide copious compliments and even hand-deliver gold statues. The terms of the deal state that Trump Media will provide TAE with $300 million in capital as a bonus of sorts, though we don&#39;t know where that money is coming from as it represents over ten percent of the company&#39;s entire valuation.
This is an all-stock deal and stocks aren&#39;t exactly immune from the manipulative whims of billionaires. To that end, shares in Trump Media have risen dramatically since this deal was announced. President Trump shifted his stake in the company to a revocable trust that he is the sole beneficiary of and is controlled by Donald Trump Jr.

Apple opens up iOS in Japan in response to new regulations,"You can add Japan to the list of regions where Apple has been forced to do something it would rather not: open up the App Store. On Thursday, the company announced changes to iOS in Japan to comply with the nation&#39;s Mobile Software Competition Act (MSCA). The tighter regulations for Apple and Google, which overlap with Europe&#39;s, took effect today. Users in the US and elsewhere won&#39;t see any of these changes.Apple&#39;s changes in iOS 26.2 in Japan revolve around alternative app stores, payments outside the App Store and browser choice. The company worked with Japanese regulators on new protections for increased security risks.The company calls this set of safeguards Notarization. It involves an authorization process for alternative app stores and child-safety protocols. Third-party marketplaces will need to undergo a baseline security review. This uses a combination of human and automated checks to block malware and other threats.Naturally, Apple cautions that Notarization is less comprehensive than the App Store&#39;s reviews. &#34;The App Store — where every app is reviewed to meet the App Store&#39;s high bar for privacy and security — remains the best place for iOS users in Japan to discover and download the apps they love,&#34; the company wrote.To state the obvious, the App Store is a booming business for the iPhone maker. In 2024, it generated $1.3 trillion in total sales. Opening it up poses a threat to one of the company&#39;s most reliable revenue streams. Big Tech seems to talk a lot about fewer rewards and more penalties for users when their own money trees are at risk.Apple CEO Tim Cook in Tokyo in October 2025ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS via Getty ImagesiOS 26.2 in Japan also introduces new payment options. Developers can now use non-Apple payment processors within their apps or link to external websites for purchases. (Children&#39;s content is exempt from this.) Here, Apple again warns the user about the penalties for doing something that will hurt its bottom line. &#34;For apps that use alternative payment processing or link users to the web for transactions, Apple will not be able to issue refunds and will have less ability to support customers encountering issues, scams or fraud,&#34; the company cautioned.The last big change involves picking defaults within the operating system. Users in Japan will see new browser and search engine choice screens. They&#39;ll also find default controls for navigation apps and app stores. Finally, developers can now offer browsers that use alternative engines other than Apple&#39;s WebKit.Apple&#39;s announcement comes a day after Google detailed its compliance with the MSCA. Since Android is more open than iOS, Google&#39;s changes in response to the regulations are a bit less pronounced. Android users will find new browser / search choice screens, expanded billing options and side-by-side comparisons of external vs. Play Store payment options.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-opens-up-ios-in-japan-in-response-to-new-regulations-174854950.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2Fapple_1113.jpg&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=6b6d74809385382e49f685f1b6f1fb24e9e6d6ed,https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-opens-up-ios-in-japan-in-response-to-new-regulations-174854950.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-18T17:48:54Z,9,Tech
WhatsApp accounts targeted in ‘GhostPairing’ attack,"
		
					  
						




A warning for WhatsApp users: cybercriminals have discovered an alarmingly simple way to access a user’s conversations in real time by manipulating the app’s device pairing or linking routine.



Termed ‘GhostPairing’ by researchers at security company Gen Digital (owner of Norton, Avast, Avira, and AVG), no passwords or account details are needed to execute the attack, which was recently detected in Czechia.



All the attacker has to do is persuade a user to click on a malicious link sent to them as a WhatsApp message purporting to reveal a Facebook photo.



In the most common variant of the attack, this throws up a fake page which asks the user to verify themselves by entering their mobile number. This number is then forwarded by the attackers to WhatsApp to initiate the ‘link device via phone number’ feature which adds new devices to an account.



WhatsApp generates an 8-digit pairing code, which is intercepted and forwarded to the user. The user, who sees a new pairing prompt in WhatsApp, enters this code to confirm the pairing. Unfortunately, this adds the attacker’s browser session as a ‘trusted device.’



Unless the user becomes suspicious, it’s game over: the attacker now has full access to their account, messages, and message history, as well as the ability to view messages as they are sent and received.



“After their device is linked, the attacker does not need to exploit anything else. They have the same capabilities that any user has when connecting WhatsApp Web on their own computer,” said Gen Digital’s researchers. “Everything happens inside the boundaries of the feature set that WhatsApp intended.”



Worse, the attackers can also send messages that impersonate the user to spread the campaign to the victim’s contacts and WhatsApp groups.



E2EE bypass



GhostPairing is an example of an attack that exploits one of WhatsApp’s biggest draws: signing up, connecting to other users, and adding up to four additional devices to an account is incredibly convenient. It’s one reason why WhatsApp has become so popular. All users need to join is a phone number, with no username or password to remember.



Another draw is that the app is built on end-to-end encryption (E2EE) privacy in which the private keys used to secure messages are stored on the device itself. This should make it impossible to eavesdrop on private messages without either having physical access to the device or remotely infecting it with malware.



GhostPairing demonstrates that a social engineering attack can bypass this. Interestingly, although still possible, the attack is less practical when asking users to pair via QR codes. That offers some reassurance for users of messaging apps such as Signal, which only allows pairing requests via QR Codes.



Defending WhatsApp



Users can check which devices are paired via WhatsApp via Settings &gt; Linked Devices. A rogue device link will appear here. Despite having access to a user’s WhatsApp account, the attacker can’t revoke their device access, which must be initiated by the primary device. Another tip is to enable two-step PIN verification. This won’t stop the attacker accessing messages but will mean they can’t change the primary email address.



The threat to enterprises is that large numbers of employees use WhatsApp as well as communicating in larger employee discussion groups. The risk is that many of these won’t be documented and will therefore be overlooked by security teams.



The recommendation is to assume that multiple groups do exist and educate users to report suspicious phishing or spam from unknown numbers. The message should be clear: WhatsApp messaging might look private, but the app itself has gaps that attackers can exploit.



GhostPairing comes only weeks after university researchers uncovered a major WhatsApp flaw that allowed them to discover the mobile numbers of the app’s 3.5 billion global user base. Earlier this year, Meta discovered a weakness in the WhatsApp Desktop app that could be used to target Windows users.



And it’s not only WhatsApp; researchers recently uncovered a hack affecting the company that created a modified version of Signal for use by senior US politicians.

Save on Crunchyroll annual subscriptions this holiday season,"If you&#39;re struggling to find your next binge-watch, you can&#39;t go wrong with anime. For the holidays, you can save on a Crunchyroll subscription, giving you access to its vast library of anime series to watch. Through December 29, you can sign up for an annual Fan subscription for $67, down from the usual $80, or a Mega Fan subscription for $100, down from $120. 
While both the Fan and Mega Fan plans are ad-free, you do get some different benefits depending on which you decide to pay for. Fan subscribers get full access to Crunchyroll&#39;s library, new episodes &#34;shortly after they air in Japan&#34; and five percent off select purchases in the Crunchyroll Store. Mega Fan subscribers get all those benefits, plus the ability to stream on four devices at the same time, download HD quality episodes and movies to view offline, play games from the Crunchyroll Game Vault and receive 10 percent off select products in the Crunchyroll Store. 

  
Notably missing from either subscription is access to Crunchyroll&#39;s new Manga service, but unless you&#39;re specifically looking for reading material, you&#39;ll get plenty of entertainment out of Crunchyroll&#39;s video library. Outside of Netflix, which produces and licenses its own growing collection of anime, Crunchyroll is the de facto place to watch Japanese animation in the US. You&#39;ll find long-running series like One Piece and newer hits like Spy X Family, alongside hundreds of more niche series. 
Crunchyroll has its issues, of course. Since the streaming service was acquired by Sony, it&#39;s been particularly interested in using generative AI to subtitle shows, which has already produced poor results. It&#39;s hard to beat Crunchyroll&#39;s library, though, and for as little as $65, you&#39;ll get more than your money&#39;s worth.

Alexa+ can now answer your Ring doorbell and talk to people,"Amazon just introduced a new feature for Alexa+ called Greetings. This lets Alexa+ answer the doorbell and converse with visitors, which certainly sounds futuristic in a &#34;gated community as dystopia&#34; kind of way.
There are several caveats here. First of all, it only works with certain newer Ring video doorbell models. Customers also have to pony up for a Ring Premium Plan and have access to the Alexa+ early access build. It&#39;s available in the US and Canada and only in English.
If you meet those criteria, this could be a fairly useful little feature. Amazon says it &#34;transforms your Ring doorbell into an intelligent assistant capable of determining who&#39;s at your door, understanding what they need and responding conversationally.&#34; The company promises that the tool operates whether people or home or out doing errands.
How does this work? It&#39;s an AI algorithm that &#34;determines who&#39;s there based on what they&#39;re wearing, holding or their actions.&#34; It will use &#34;visual context, any information the visitor shares and the instructions it&#39;s been given to help manage interactions on your behalf.&#34;
Amazon says that it can, for instance, distinguish if a person is wearing a delivery uniform and tell them to leave the package at the back door. Most of my delivery drivers don&#39;t come to the door in full uniforms because it&#39;s winter and that would be ridiculous. I don&#39;t even expect that during the summer. In other words, this is modern AI and mistakes will happen.
The company gives other examples of how this could be used, like gathering messages from friends who stop by and telling door-to-door salespeople to (politely) bug off. Amazon also says Alexa+ will be able to direct visitors to water and snacks that have previously been laid out. Finally, there&#39;s a way to avoid those pesky cute kids on Halloween while still providing them with treats.
Everything can be reviewed later on via the Ring app, which should provide context as to who has been hanging around the porch. Alexa+ Greetings are rolling out today.

For the uninitiated, Alexa+ is Amazon&#39;s updated chatbot. It&#39;s more conversational than the old Alexa, which could be useful or annoying depending on what you use it for. I use Alexa primarily as an alarm, so I don&#39;t necessarily want a gabfest.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/alexa-can-now-answer-your-ring-doorbell-and-talk-to-people-162712774.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F84658490-dc2d-11f0-afba-62042a949a57&resize=1400%2C790&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=995dafd2978d0fe130e14c7d13edecd44c7dd883,https://www.engadget.com/ai/alexa-can-now-answer-your-ring-doorbell-and-talk-to-people-162712774.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-18T16:27:12Z,9,Tech

The innovative CISO’s bucket list: Human-led transformation at the core,"
		
					  
						




Ask any chief information security officer (CISO) what keeps them up at night and you’ll likely get a familiar list of persistent threats: ransomware, AI-enabled nation-state actors and in-the-wild exploitation of vulnerabilities hiding in an ever-expanding digital footprint. For years, the role has been defined by a state of constant vigilance, a reactive posture against an unending siege.



In nearly every conversation I now have with CISOs, I ask them what they would do if they could reclaim 25% of their time. What I hear aren’t wishes for more tropical vacations. Instead, the responses form a new bucket list focused on innovation and transformation.



Energized by AI’s power and potential, CISOs are creating lists that paint a picture of a new-normal state for security that is proactive, deeply human-centric and autonomous. This isn’t about adding another blinking box to the security stack; it’s a practical — and at times profound — roadmap for re-engineering the very function of security. It’s about fundamentally shifting the paradigm of how security creates value, moving from a cost center to an innovation center that truly enables the business.



Based on my conversations, here are the top three themes that characterize the innovative CISO’s new collective bucket list.



From tactical debt to strategic foresight



Before a CISO can focus on the horizon, they must first solidify the ground beneath their feet. The first theme on every CISO’s list is the desire to build a foundation of excellence that enables truly proactive strategy. This starts with clearing out the tactical debt that consumes so much time. Leaders are eager to finally tackle housekeeping — tying up the 10% of projects left at 90% completion.



In security, that last 10% is far from insignificant. It comprises unpatched systems, misconfigured or neglected cloud assets, and other open doors that attackers could walk right through. These incomplete projects represent not only a persistent security gap but also a significant waste of budget and resources that CISOs are desperate to reclaim.



This foundational work extends to the entire ecosystem. Leaders want the time to analyze all vendor assessments methodically. In an age of interconnected APIs and third-party dependencies, a CISO’s defense is only as strong as its weakest vendor. They are constantly thinking about the next Log4j scenario and know that without a proper handle on supply-chain risk, their entire strategy rests on a house of cards.



Finally, clearing the decks means nailing every last plan of action and milestone (POAM) from their audits. This goes beyond simple box-checking to demonstrating institutional integrity. It proves to the board and to regulators that security is a mature, accountable and continuous process, not just a perpetual game of whack-a-mole played in the wake of a bad report.



By clearing the decks and closing existing gaps, they can shift their focus to the bigger picture: preventative security that stops attacks before they happen. This foundational excellence gives them the credibility and mental space to devote crucial time to the calculus of risk; for example, analyzing whether faster detection capabilities allow them to adjust or dial back specific preventive controls.



It also enables more effective strategic communication with the board, framed in the language of business acceptance and risk tolerance.



Building a unified, integrated defense



The second major bucket list theme is breaking down the silos that perpetually plague security organizations. Application security (AppSec), cloud security (CloudSec) and governance, risk and compliance (GRC) groups all work from different spreadsheets and tools and often with different objectives. This model is inefficient, expensive and leaves massive gaps for attackers to exploit.



CISOs aim to develop innovative processes and solutions that integrate disparate teams. As one leader eloquently described it to me, the ultimate goal is a “beautiful web of automations.” For example, this means automating control evidence across all security tools so that when an auditor requests proof of compliance, it’s generated in seconds — not through a three-week fire drill that diverts 10 analysts from their primary responsibilities.



It’s a vision that allows all security functions to work together seamlessly, with AI correlating data from all sources to provide a single, unified picture of risk.



This integration extends beyond the security team itself. A key priority is bringing “the harmony of security into legal” from a privacy perspective and deeply embedding compliance into security engineering. In a world of GDPR, CCPA and a patchwork of other regulations, privacy is no longer just a legal concern: it’s a core security and engineering challenge. The CISOs want to partner with their general counsels to embed privacy-by-design into the development life cycle, rather than just react to data breaches or privacy requests.



This vision is also pragmatic. CISOs are tired of shelfware — the expensive, complex tools their teams are too busy to deploy correctly. Their list includes time for strategic problem-solving: digging into their existing platforms to find creative ways to up their game, rather than just chasing the next silver-bullet solution. It’s about creative engineering to build an environment that, as one CISO told me, “just works.”



Security as a human-led business enabler



Finally, the CISO bucket list is profoundly human. This begins with a profound shift in mindset, from being a gatekeeper to being a partner. Their ultimate objective is business enablement through effective risk management, freeing leaders from being dragged into operational tasks and allowing them to function as true C-suite peers. This requires investing time in understanding the business by sitting with product managers, joining sales calls and learning what drives revenue.



While AI can automate tasks, it cannot build trust. CISOs are adamant about carving out time for human engagement — building relationships with partners, mentoring associates and collaborating with fellow executives. This is the irreplaceable human work that creates the political capital and cross-functional alignment needed to drive real change.



This human-centric view is also the key to solving security’s most persistent challenge: the talent gap. The bucket list is filled with a passionate desire to invest in people. Internally, this means doubling down on talent that can grow and innovate. CISOs want to provide their team members with the time and budget to obtain the desired education credits and the space for genuine innovation. This isn’t just a nice-to-have; it’s a critical retention strategy. It’s how they keep their top analysts from burning out due to alert fatigue and empower them to solve the company’s most unique and challenging problems.



Externally, this passion extends to giving back to the community, engaging with middle and high schools to cultivate the next generation of defenders and solving the talent pipeline problem at its root.



By fostering an environment of learning and innovation, CISOs empower their people to achieve the final — and perhaps most important — item on their bucket list: the time to break and reinvent the inefficient security processes they have all observed and been forced to live with throughout their careers.



The future is human-led and AI-powered



Taken together, these bucket list themes paint a clear picture of the future of security leadership. It’s a future where CISOs are no longer just the chief defenders, but strategic business partners who cultivate resilience and enable innovation. Achieving this vision means shifting from chasing alerts to anticipating threats, empowering security professionals to do their most meaningful work and leveraging AI not to replace human expertise, but to amplify it.



The goal is to build a security function that is as intelligent, adaptive and creative as the humans at its core. That is the future we should all strive for.

Meetup's new mobile app is designed to make it easier to meet people IRL,"If you&#39;re like me, it&#39;s probably been a hot minute since you’ve used or even thought of Meetup. Predating both Facebook and Twitter, the website, which was designed to help people organize in-person events, has changed hands a handful of times in recent years. In 2017, founder Scott Heiferman sold it to WeWork, which offloaded it a few years later before declaring bankruptcy in 2023. As of 2024, Bending Spoons, the Italian tech company that&#39;s probably best known for buying Evernote in 2022, has been running Meetup. In the aftermath of the pandemic, the platform has seen something of resurgence. As of late 2025, Gen Z and young Millennials make up 40 percent of Meetup&#39;s active user base and represent its most engaged group of users. This year, the app has also seen a 20 percent year-over-year increase in new registrations. Going into 2026, Bending Spoons is hoping to build on that momentum with a redesign of Meetup&#39;s mobile app. The new interface, which starts rolling out today, brings the Android and iOS app inline with Meetup&#39;s recently redesigned website. Across the application, users can expect updated fonts, new more colorful icons and better spacing. The goal of the redesign is to make the app &#34;vibrant, fun and more modern than before,&#34; says Chiara Vivaldi, Meetup&#39;s product lead. She adds the redesigned app retains all the key features found in the previous version, while making those easier to find. For instance, users can access their profile and groups directly from the homepage of the app.  Beyond making Meetup feel more modern, Bending Spoon is using the redesign to cement the groundwork for a series of improvements it plans to roll out in the coming months. Soon, Meetup users will be able to see a breakdown of the people who have signed up for an event.Bending SpoonsAccording to Vivaldi, one major priority is to give people, particularly women, more confidence to attend the events that are listed on Meetup. When you navigate to an event page in the new app, you&#39;ll see a broad gender and age breakdown of the users who have signed up to be there. Additionally, new and richer user profiles allow people to get a better sense of who exactly they might meet if they decide to go. Bending Spoons is also introducing a new Super Organizer badge it plans to award to the platform&#39;s top event planners. It&#39;s designed to signal to users that the person who put together the event takes community building seriously. Taken together, Vivaldi says these features are designed to reduce the friction of attending events where you might not know anyone, and they&#39;re something the company plans to build on in the future. At the same time, Bending Spoons plans to make it easier for organizers to use Meetup. Starting early next year, the company will unify Meetup&#39;s two disparate apps — right now, the company maintains separate ones for members and organizers. Vivaldi says organizers can expect the unified app to include all of the features they depend on, alongside a handful of enhancements. For instance, Vivaldi’s team is working to make QR-based ticketing the norm for check-ins and attendance tracking. She says the move to a single app is informed by the fact that 75 percent of Meetup&#39;s organizers got their start as a member. &#34;[Organizers] are part of the community. They want to be in the action, and so having them within the same app is conducive to that. They can jump into conversations, look at other events, making it all feel a bit more organic,&#34; Vivaldi said. In the meantime, if it’s been since you’ve used Meetup, you  can download the redesigned app from the App and Google Play stores.

OpenAI just launched an app store inside ChatGPT,"OpenAI has introduced an app directory that&#39;s now available right inside ChatGPT, the company announced. &#34;Apps extend ChatGPT conversations by bringing in new context and letting users take action like order groceries, turn an outline into a slide deck or search for an apartment,&#34; the company wrote in a blog post. OpenAI also noted in a help document that &#34;connector&#34; apps like Google Drive are now simply called &#34;apps.&#34;
The new apps section (on iOS, Android and web) is divided into Feature, Lifestyle and Productivity categories, letting you connect to commonly used apps and sites like Booking.com, Spotify and Dropbox. To use an app, simply click on it, hit &#34;Connect&#34; then authorize the app to access ChatGPT. With that done, you can then start a chat related to that app. In the case of Dropbox, for instance, you&#39;ll be able to &#34;gather insights, prepare briefs and summarize reports or internal documents,&#34; according to the description. Once connected, any app can be accessed by doing an @ mention of it.
A new addition that came along with the store is an Apple Music app that, like Spotify, helps users find music, create playlists and manage their libraries through a chat interface. Another is DoorDash, which lets you transform recipes, meal planning and staples into &#34;an actionable shopping cart.&#34;
Along with the app directory, OpenAI is now allowing developers to submit apps for review and publication in ChatGPT according to the company&#39;s app submission guidelines. It also published resources to help developers build such apps, including best practices, open-source example apps, an open-sourced UI library for chat-native interfaces and a step-by-step quickstart guide. That&#39;s on top of the software developer kit (SDK) that OpenAI introduced in October.
OpenAI noted that for now, developers can only monetize apps by linking out from the ChatGPT app to the native app or website — but the company is exploring internal monetization options as well. Privacy was also emphasized, with companies required to provide &#34;clear&#34; policies.
The new feature is a big part of Sam Altman&#39;s promises to make ChatGPT more versatile with the addition of custom &#34;GPT&#34; bots. &#34;Over time, we want apps in ChatGPT to feel like a natural extension of the conversation, helping people move from ideas to action, while building a thriving ecosystem for developers,&#34; the company wrote.

The AirPods Pro 3 are back on sale for a record low of $199,"No need to fret if you missed out on some of the best Black Friday deals this year — some of them have returned already. Case in point: Apple&#39;s AirPods Pro 3, which came out in September this year, are back down to $199. That&#39;s an all-time-low price and better than the price it was during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. With the new AirPods Pro, Apple made some big improvements, including better battery life and sound quality, and introduced useful new features, such as Live Translation. 

  
The AirPods Pro 3 are the best AirPods available today, with Apple&#39;s H2 chip, and earned a score of 90 out of 100 in Engadget&#39;s review this fall. Active noise cancellation (ANC) is one of the biggest selling points of the AirPods Pro, and Apple has made the experience even better with the AirPods Pro 3. They sport new foam-infused ear tips that create a better seal to improve passive noise isolation, and as Engadget&#39;s Billy Steele wrote in his review, &#34;Ultra-low-noise microphones combine with advanced computational audio to silence even more background noise.&#34; In testing, they had no problem blocking out the chatter of people nearby or otherwise noisy environments. 
With the AirPods Pro 3, Apple introduced heart-rate sensing, so you&#39;ll be able to see your heart rate data from the earbuds in the Fitness app and other workout apps. The AirPods Pro 3 also boast Live Translation, which you can activate via controls on the earbuds themselves. As long as you have an Apple Intelligence-capable device, you&#39;ll be able to translate in-person conversations in English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish and Chinese (Mandarin).

This data is cross-referenced with movement patterns, sleep fragmentation patterns and resting heart rate to &#34;show exactly how breathing issues shape sleep quality.&#34; The company says this can be a good resource when experimenting with interventions, like switching to a new pillow or taping up the nose.
More health data is never a bad thing, but this information isn&#39;t free. Ultrahuman is charging $4 per month for access to the tool, though folks can pick up an annual subscription for $40.
The Ultrahuman Ring Air made our list of the best smart rings, and that was before the company introduced this new software.

The FTC is reportedly investigating Instacart over its AI pricing tool,"The Federal Trade Commission has sent Instacart a civil investigative demand, seeking information about its AI-powered pricing tool, according to Reuters. This comes after a recently published pricing experiment study showed that the online grocery delivery app gave different users different prices for the same items from the same store location at the exact same time. Some of the testers saw prices up to 23 percent higher than what the other testers saw, though the average difference for the same list of items was around 7 percent. Those higher prices could cost customers over $1,000 more in expenses for the year. “The Federal Trade Commission has a longstanding policy of not commenting on any potential or ongoing investigations,” the FTC told Reuters in a statement. “But, like so many Americans, we are disturbed by what we have read in the press about Instacart’s alleged pricing practices.”When the study came out, Instacart told Engadget that the pricing variances were caused by some of its retail partners doing “limited, short-term and randomized tests” to better understand consumers. Those randomized pricing tests were enabled by Instacart’s AI pricing tool called Eversight developed by a company it purchased in 2022. Instacart told CNBC that “much of what’s been reported has mischaracterized how pricing works” on its platform. The spokesperson repeated that retailers conduct pricing tests on its app and said that “prices on Instacart do not change in real time,” aren’t based on supply or demand and that it never uses “personal, demographic, or user-level behavioral data to set item prices.”This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/the-ftc-is-reportedly-investigating-instacart-over-its-ai-pricing-tool-130000472.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2021-07%2F814c09f0-e4c0-11eb-ad5e-a3bf9ca2b369&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=4eb87aa8475d5da69ac5d097617591a6974a6f66,https://www.engadget.com/apps/the-ftc-is-reportedly-investigating-instacart-over-its-ai-pricing-tool-130000472.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-18T13:00:00Z,7,Tech
Sony settles with Tencent over 'slavish' Horizon clone,"Earlier this year Sony sued Tencent for copyright infringement over its Light of Motiram game, calling it a &#34;slavish clone&#34; of Horizon Zero Dawn. Then, earlier this month, Tencent agreed to stop promoting and publicly testing the game. Now, the two companies have reached a &#34;confidential settlement&#34; and the case has been dismissed, according to court documents seen by The Verge. Light of Motiram has also disappeared from Steam and Epic&#39;s game stores. 
&#34;SIE and Tencent are pleased to have reached a confidential resolution and will have no further public comment on this matter,&#34; Tencent&#39;s spokesperson told The Verge. 
When Sony first filed its lawsuit in July 2025, it said that Tencent&#39;s game appeared to copy aspects of not just Horizon Zero Dawn, but other franchise games including Horizon Forbidden West and Lego Horizon Adventures. That included the post-apocalyptic setting with humans and machines coexisting, the visual appearance of characters and even the marketing materials — something Engadget certainly noticed when Tencent first announced the game.

Human-in-the-loop isn’t enough: New attack turns AI safeguards into exploits,"
		
					  
						




Human-in-the-loop (HITL) safeguards that AI agents rely on can be subverted, allowing attackers to weaponize them to run malicious code, new research from CheckMarx shows.



HITL dialogs are a safety backstop (a final “are you sure?”) that the agents run before executing sensitive actions like running code, modifying files, or touching system resources.



Checkmarx researchers described it as an HITL dialog forging technique they’re calling Lies-in-the-Loop (LITL), where malicious instructions are embedded into AI prompts in ways that mislead users reviewing approval dialogs.



The research findings reveal that keeping a human in the loop is not enough to neutralize prompt-level abuse. Once users can’t reliably trust what they’re being asked to approve, HITL stops being a guardrail and becomes an attack surface.



“The Lies-in-the-Loop (LITL) attack exploits the trust users place in these approval dialogs,” CheckMarx researchers said in a blog post. “By manipulating what the dialog displays, attackers turn the safeguard into a weapon — once the prompt looks safe, users approve it without question.”



Dialog forging turns oversight into an attack primitive



The problem stems from how AI systems present confirmation dialogs to users. HITL workflows typically summarize the action an AI agent wants to perform, expecting the human reviewer to spot anything suspicious before clicking approve.



CheckMarx demonstrated that attackers can manipulate these dialogs by hiding or misrepresenting malicious instructions, like padding payloads with benign-looking text, pushing dangerous commands out of the visible view, or crafting prompts that cause the AI to generate misleading summaries of what will actually execute.



In terminal-style interfaces, especially, long or formatted outputs make this kind of deception easy to miss. Since many AI agents operate with elevated privileges, a single misled approval can translate directly into code execution, running OS commands, file system access, or downstream compromise, according to CheckMarx findings.



Beyond padding or truncation, the researchers also described other dialog-forging techniques that abuse how confirmation is rendered. By leveraging Markdown rendering and layout behaviors, attackers can visually separate benign text from hidden commands or manipulate summaries so the human-visible description isn’t malicious.



“The fact that attackers can theoretically break out of the Markdown syntax used for the HITL dialog, presenting the user with fake UI, can lead to much more sophisticated LITL attacks that can go practically undetected,” the researchers added.



Defensive steps for agents and users



Checkmarx recommended measures primarily for AI agent developers, urging them to treat HITL dialogs as potentially manipulative rather than inherently trustworthy. Recommended steps include constraining how dialogs are rendered, limiting the use of complex UI formatting, and clearly separating human-visible summaries from the underlying actions that will be executed.



The researchers also advised validating approved operations to ensure they match what the user was shown at confirmation time.



For AI users, they noted that agents operating in richer UI environments can make deceptive behavior easier to detect than text-only terminals. “For instance, VS Code extensions provide full Markdown rendering capabilities, whereas terminals typically display content using basic ASCII characters,” they said.



CheckMarx said the issue was disclosed to Anthropic and Microsoft, both of which acknowledged the report but did not classify it as a security vulnerability. Neither company immediately responded to CSO’s request for comments.

Cisco confirms zero-day exploitation of Secure Email products,"
		
					  
						




Cisco has warned that a China-linked hacking group is actively exploiting a previously unknown vulnerability in its Secure Email appliances to gain persistent access, forcing affected organizations to consider disruptive rebuilds of critical security infrastructure while patches remain unavailable.



Cisco Talos said the campaign has been active since at least late November, raising concerns for security leaders about unseen compromise and how far incident response efforts may need to extend beyond the affected devices.



The vulnerability affects Cisco Secure Email Gateway, Cisco Secure Email, and Web Manager appliances running AsyncOS, but only in configurations where the Spam Quarantine feature is enabled and exposed to the internet, according to Cisco.



The company said there is currently no patch available, and that rebuilding affected appliances is the only way to fully remove the attackers’ persistence mechanisms in confirmed compromise cases.



Enterprise exposure and risk scope



Cisco said that systems where the Spam Quarantine feature is not enabled are not affected, but analysts said this does not necessarily reduce enterprise risk.



“This vulnerability may remain a high-risk issue because affected appliances typically sit in privileged network positions, even though the feature is not enabled by default,” said Sunil Varkey, a cybersecurity analyst.  



It is also not clear how many enterprises may have enabled the feature in production environments, said Keith Prabhu, founder and CEO of Confidis.



“The Spam Quarantine provides a way for administrators to review and release ‘false positives,’ i.e., legitimate email messages that the appliance has deemed to be spam,” Prabhu said. “In today’s remote support and 24×7 operations, it is entirely possible that this feature has been enabled by many enterprises.”



Akshat Tyagi, associate practice leader at HFS Research, said the bigger concern is the nature of the target. Unlike a user laptop or a standalone server, email security systems sit at the center of how organizations filter and trust email traffic, meaning attackers would be operating inside infrastructure designed to stop threats rather than receive them.



“The fact that there’s no patch yet elevates the risk further,” Tyagi said. “When the vendor’s guidance is to rebuild appliances rather than clean them in place, it tells you this is about persistence and control, not just a one-off exploit.”



Varkey added that exploitation may not require direct internet exposure and could also occur from internal or VPN-reachable networks, advising organizations to close or restrict access to affected management ports temporarily.



Rebuild guidance and operational tradeoffs



Cisco has said that wiping and rebuilding appliances is currently required in cases where compromise has been confirmed.



“From a security standpoint, it is indeed the right call,” Tyagi said. “When there’s a risk that attackers have embedded themselves deep in a system, patching alone won’t solve the issue. Rebuilding is the only way to be confident the threat is fully removed.”



But Varkey said that this may not be a viable option for many organizations, as it introduces business risks, including downtime, misconfiguration, and the potential reintroduction of persistence through contaminated backups.



Enterprises will need to balance remediation speed with business continuity while relying on compensating controls to limit exposure. “Cisco Secure Email Gateway, Cisco Secure Email, and Web Manager are critical components of the email infrastructure,” Prabhu said. “Organizations would need to plan this activity in a way that minimizes downtime, but at the same time reduces the time window of compromise. In the interim, they could use other security measures like blocking ports on the firewall to limit exposure.”

The best AirPods for 2026,"Apple’s AirPods have become the default choice for many people, whether you want simple wireless earbuds that work without fuss or premium options with features like noise cancellation and spatial audio. The lineup has grown over the years, so there is now a model for almost every type of listener. Some pairs are built for all-day comfort, others focus on isolation and richer sound, and Apple’s over-ear option offers a more immersive experience for movies and music.If you spend most of your time on an iPhone or iPad, all AirPods share one big advantage: they connect instantly and switch between Apple devices seamlessly. With new models always on the horizon and longtime favorites still holding up well, we rounded up the best AirPods to help you decide which ones match your listening style.

What you need to know about AirPods 
When it comes to Apple’s earbuds and headphones, there are several things you’ll want to keep in mind before making your final decision. First, the standard AirPods are the open-design earbuds with no tip that allow some environmental noise to come into your ears at all times. The Apple AirPods Pro are the model with tips that completely close off your ear canal, which enables features like more powerful noise cancellation and the hearing test. Lastly, the Apple AirPods Max are the company’s over-ear noise-canceling headphones preferred by audiophiles, and currently the company’s only option for wireless headphones at all that aren’t made by Beats. 
There are a few features that are available across all models as they’ve become inherent to the AirPods experience. First, you can expect connectivity perks like Automatic Switching between Apple devices that are synced with your iCloud account. This means that a pair of AirPods will automatically change to your phone when you get a call while you’re listening to music on a MacBook or laptop, for example. It’s functionally similar to multipoint Bluetooth, but the feature isn’t limited to two devices like most earbuds and headphones. Second, hands-free access to Siri is the default, allowing you to ask the assistant for help without touching your AirPods. And lastly, Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking is available across the entire lineup, even on the most affordable version and the new AirPods, including AirPods 4 with active noise cancellation. 
If you don’t think any of the AirPods options are right for you, consult our recommendations on the best wireless earbuds and best wireless headphones for some alternatives.

AirPods 4 with ANC 
The AirPods 4 with ANC represent the first time active noise cancellation has been available on the open-wear, “regular” AirPods. Design-wise, they’re the same as the non-ANC model, so the difference is entirely in the features list. This more expensive version adds Adaptive Audio, Transparency mode, Conversation Awareness and a wireless charging case. The ANC isn’t as powerful as the AirPods Pro 2, partially due to the fact that the AirPods 4 doesn’t completely seal off your ears. The noise-canceling performance is definitely useful though, working best with constant, low-frequency annoyances like fans and white noise machines. Lastly, you won’t get access to Apple’s hearing test and hearing aid features, partially due to the fact that the AirPods 4 with ANC doesn’t seal off your ears, which would affect accuracy and effectiveness.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-airpods-100041810.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F6b016830-d44d-11f0-9eef-e17677ad73ff&resize=1400%2C840&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=43efd464e30d5b5ac551117083e79a663a5c2d08,https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-airpods-100041810.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-18T10:01:26Z,11,Tech

"The best streaming deals: Get 50 percent off MasterClass subscriptions, plus save on Starz, Audible, Crunchyroll and others","Whether you’re a true cord-cutter or you just want to watch the next season of Stranger Things when it drops, everyone’s on the lookout for streaming deals nowadays. Plenty have chosen VOD and live TV streaming services over traditional cable in recent years, but the savings that choice got you just a few years ago have somewhat evaporated now. Companies like Netflix, Disney, Max and others have been consistently raising prices to the point where you may question if streaming is even worth it anymore. 
We at Engadget still think so, for many reasons, but you can (and should) be smart with your money at the same time. Streaming deals are an option, even if they don’t come around with the same regularity as discounts on AirPods do. If you’re looking to save money and still stream all of the content you want, Engadget can help by laying out the best streaming deals you can get right now, how you can save with bundles and everything you should know before paying for yet another streaming service. 
Best streaming deals 
True streaming deals can be hard to come by. Most often, they’ll pop up during the Black Friday shopping period. On occasion, we’ll see them sparingly throughout the year and they usually take the form of a discounted monthly or annual rate for a limited period of time. Also, true streaming deals are typically on the ad-supported versions of a service, but once in a while you’ll find a unicorn of a deal on a tier that has ad-free viewing. 
If you’re able to wait for a deal before subscribing to a streaming service, we recommend doing so. You’ll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate. 

  
ESPN Unlimited bundle — $30/month with Disney+ and Hulu for free for one year: Sports fans can sign up for the new ESPB Unlimited bundle at the standard $30-per-month rate, but for a limited time, you can get Disney+ and Hulu (with ads) included in that price for free. The trio bundle would typically cost you $36 per month, so overall, you&#39;re saving $6 per month for one year, for a total of $72 in savings. 
Philo Core — $25 for your first month ($8 off): Our pick for the best cheap live TV streaming service, Philo offers more than 70 channels in its Core tier, plus access to HBO Max (with ads), AMC+ and Discovery+. After your first month, the subscription will auto-renew at the standard $33-per-month rate. 
Audible — three months for $3: For literally $1 per month, you can get access to Audible&#39;s enormous library of published audiobooks, podcasts and Audible Originals (which can be anything from never-before-heard books to live performances). It&#39;s only three months, after which you&#39;ll have to cancel or renew at the regular price, but an audiobibliophile can cram a lot of listening into 90 days. 
Crunchyroll — $67 for one year ($13 off): Anime fans can get one year of Crunchyroll access for less right now. The Fan tier is down to $67 for the year, while the Mega Fan tier is on sale for $100 for one year. Both tiers give you ad-free access to the streaming service, but you&#39;ll get offline access and up to four simultaneous streams with the Mega Fan option. Note that this deal does not include access to Crunchyroll Manga. 
Starz (one year) for $12 ($58 off): Pay upfront for one year and you can get more than $40 off a Stars annual subscription. There&#39;s a month-to-month option too, which costs $3 per month for the first three months if you don&#39;t want to commit to the full year. Either option gives you access to the entire Starz TV and movie library with offline viewing and no ads. 
Spotify Premium Individual — four months for free ($48 off): This is our favorite music streaming service for podcasts and social features. The Premium Individual plan lets you listen ad-free and skip songs at will. You can also organize your listening queue and download content for offline listening. Just be aware, your subscription will auto-renew at the end of the trial period. So if you don&#39;t want to be on the hook for the $12 monthly fee, set a reminder to cancel and go back to the free version. 
Amazon Music Unlimited — three months for free ($36 off): Amazon&#39;s own music streaming service is now free for three months, for new subscribers only. With it, you get access to 100 million songs with no ads, many podcasts and some audiobooks from Audible as well. 
Fubo Pro for $55/month for the first month ($30 off): Fubo has introductory discounts on most of its packages, and the Pro package is the least expensive plan currently listed. It offers access to 224 channels, unlimited cloud DVR and up to 10 simultaneous streams. It even includes regional sports content from the NHL, MLB and NBA. 
DirecTV starting at $50/month for one month (up to $40 off): All of DirecTV&#39;s signature packages are up to $45 off right now for your first month when you sign up. If you opt for the base &#34;Entertainment&#34; package, you&#39;ll spend $50 for the first month and get access to over 90 channels, including many local stations as well as ESPN, ESPN 2 and Fox Sports 1. You&#39;ll also be able to watch on the go with the DirecTV mobile app. 
Streaming bundle discounts 
There’s more consolidation happening now than ever before in the streaming space, and that means there are more streaming bundle options. These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you’ll spend less overall by just paying for the single service. 
Speaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on HBO Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option. 
Disney+ 
If you feel like Charlie Kelly trying to figure out who Pepe Silvia is when you look at Disney&#39;s streaming prices chart, you&#39;re not alone. The confusion comes from the fact that Disney owns, or has a hand in, many streaming services including Hulu and ESPN. Throw in a partnership with HBO Max and you have a ton of options to consider and, probably, whiplash to match. Here&#39;s a quick overview of popular Disney+ bundle pricing. 
 
 Disney+ and Hulu bundle (with ads) — $13/month 
 Disney+ and Hulu bundle (without ads) — $20/month 
 Disney+, Hulu and ESPN Select (with ads) — $20/month 
 Disney+, Hulu and ESPN Select (without ads on Disney+ and Hulu only) — $30/month 
 Disney+, Hulu and HBO Max (with ads) — $20/month 
 Disney+, Hulu and HBO Max (without ads) — $33/month 
 
Peacock TV 
Peacock doesn&#39;t have any streaming bundles available all year round, but you can save if you pay for one year upfront. 
 
 Peacock Select (with ads) — $8/month or $80/year 
 Peacock Premium (with ads) — $11/month or $110/year 
 Peacock Premium Plus (without ads) — $17/month or $170/year 
 
Paramount+ 
Paramount+ used to bill its tier with Showtime as a sort of bundle, but it has since renamed its plans and focused the Showtime inclusion in its premium tier as just another bonus of paying for the higher priced plan. 
 
 Paramount+ Essential (with ads) —$8/month or $60/year 
 Paramount Premium (without ads) — $13/month or $120/year 
 
Student discounts on streaming services 
It pays to be a student — sometimes, at least. A number of streaming services have student discounts you can take advantage of as long as you&#39;re actively studying. What that translates to most of the time is being able to verify your student status and signing up with your .edu email address. 
HBO Max student discount — subscribe for $5/month (50 percent off): HBO Max offers their ad-supported tier to students for half off the usual rate. You’ll just have to verify that you’re a student through Unidays, and make note that this offer is only good for up to 12 months of service. 
Hulu student discount — subscribe for $2/month (75 percent off): Those with a valid student ID can get Hulu’s ad-supported tier for 75 percent off the typical rate. They’ll keep the same sale price for as long as they’re a student as well. 
Spotify student discount — Premium + Hulu with ads for $6/month (72 percent off): Spotify’s student offer continues to be one of the best around, giving you access to the Premium tier of the music streamer and Hulu’s ad-supported plan for only $6 monthly. Purchased separately, you’d pay $22 per month for both of the services. Plus, the first month is free when you sign up. 
NBA League Pass student discount — one year for $120 (40 percent off): Students can get one year of League Pass for only $10 per month, which includes access to NBA TV and the ability to watch classic and archive games on-demand. On the NBA League Pass website, look for the student discount banner at the top and follow the instructions to verify your student status.

The best multi-device wireless charging pads for 2026,"There’s a good chance you own a couple of gadgets that support wireless charging now, be it your iPhone or Android phone, wireless earbuds or smartwatch. Multi-device wireless chargers can help power them all up in one place, without the need for a bunch of cords messing up your space. There are dozens of these accessories out there today, and we’ve tested a bunch of the most popular models. You’ll find out top picks below for the best wireless charging pads, plus some advice on how to choose the right one for your needs.

Do wireless charging pads work with any phone or device? 
The short answer is no, but the long and more detailed answer starts with it depends. Regular old wireless charging pucks should work with any device that’s compatible with the same wireless charging standard that the charger supports. Smartphones and other mobile devices that support wireless charging nowadays are likely to support the Qi standard, so double check that your phone or gadget fits that bill and it should work with any Qi wireless charging pad (all of our top picks fall into this category). 
When it comes to multi-device chargers, things can get a little tricky. Rather than starting your search looking for the most universally adaptable accessory, consider the devices you have and aspire to own in the future. If you’re an iPhone user with an Apple Watch, you may want to look for a wireless charger that has a Watch pad built in. Ditto if you’re a Samsung phone owner and use a Galaxy Watch. Some earbuds support wireless charging, but you’ll only need an open pad or space on your multi-device charger where you can sit the earbuds in their case down for a power-up. 
Those with iPhone 12s and newer Apple smartphones can take advantage of MagSafe chargers, which magnetically attach to their handsets. Android devices don’t support Apple’s proprietary MagSafe technology, but you can buy a magnetic adapter for pretty cheap that will allow your Samsung or Pixel phone to work with MagSafe multi-device chargers. You’ll also need that to get full Qi2 goodness with newer Android phones like the Galaxy S25 series, which are “Qi2 ready,” but since they do not have magnets built in, aren’t precisely Qi2 compliant. 
How to pick the best wireless charging pad for your needs 

 
 
 
Even without a charging cable to worry about, you’re probably buying a multi-device wireless charger with one location in mind. It might sit on your nightstand or on your desk. Not everyone buys a charger just for themselves, though; you might want to use one as a shared station for you and a partner. 
If the charger will sit on your nightstand, you’ll likely want a compact, stable unit that won’t swallow all your free space or tumble to the floor (and if it does fall, one with enough durability to survive). Some may prefer a lay-flat design if your phone screen has a tendency to keep you awake at night. Others might use their phone as their alarm clock, in which case you may want a stand that keeps the screen within reach and eyeshot. This is also the preferred design if you use Standby Mode on iPhones. 
A vertical orientation may be best for a charger that lives on your desk so you can more easily check notifications throughout the day. Will the charger sit on a low table? Horizontal charger pads may make it easier to grab your devices in a hurry. Travel chargers should fold up or otherwise protect the pads while they’re in your bag. And, yes, aesthetics count. You may want something pretty if it’s likely to sit in a posh room where guests will see it. 
For vehicles, consider a wireless car charger if you frequently need to top off your device on the go. These chargers combine convenience with functionality, ensuring your phone stays powered while you’re navigating and taking calls at the same time. We also heavily recommend a magnetic charger so there’s less of a chance your phone will go flying into the passenger’s seat the next time you hit a pothole. 
Wireless charging speed and performance 
It’s no secret that wireless charging is slower than wired, and powering multiple devices adds a new wrinkle. As these chargers often have to support a wide range of hardware, you’ll have to forget about the fastest, device-specific options from brands like Google, OnePlus and Samsung. 
Today, most wireless chargers come in at 15W for phones. The latest Qi2 standard can get you up to 25W of power with a compatible smartphone. These speeds are improving bit by bit, but they&#39;re still not quite as fast as wired charging. It’s rare that you’ll find a truly slow-as-molasses example, mind you. Even some of the most affordable options we’ve seen will recharge your phone at a reasonable 7.5W or 10W, and the 5W for other devices like wireless earbuds is more than enough. 
If you’re only docking overnight or while you work, speed won’t make a huge difference. Just be sure that whatever you buy is powerful enough for a phone in a case. Some chargers may also include an AC adapter in the box. If not, make sure you’re using one with the right power level to get the fastest charge.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-multi-device-wireless-charging-pads-120557582.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2Fe7536150-d767-11f0-b8b7-4c3c7dcab9b2&resize=1400%2C840&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=59a1edf92501cd7b725411acb846784d9876b9ac,https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-multi-device-wireless-charging-pads-120557582.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-18T08:01:26Z,8,Tech

D&O liability protection rising for security leaders — unless you’re a midtier CISO,"
		
					  
						




Smaller firms are far less likely than multinationals to protect their CISOs from personal liability for security breaches, according to a study by RSAC.



Experts quizzed by CSO said the finding was concerning because without protection CISOs face legal and financial risk tied to decisions made in their role.



The vast majority (88%) of CISOs from Fortune 1000 firms are legally indemnified by their companies, but this figure drops to just 53% for CISOs from organizations with 500 or more employees, according to the survey by RSAC (formerly RSA Conference).



Directors’ and officers’ (D&amp;O) insurance is the most common indemnification vehicle for both groups, and 70% of the Fortune 1000 CISOs surveyed report being covered by it.



Kelly Rittenberry Culhane, co-founder of CM Law, told CSO the finding is a concern for security leaders and midsize employers alike, given that, midsize or multinational, organizations face similar risks.



“While the complexity and scale of operations may differ in a midsize company, the cybersecurity risks — ransomware, data breaches, regulatory compliance failures — are equally severe,” Rittenberry Culhane says. “Without indemnification, CISOs risk personal liability, which can deter highly qualified professionals from accepting these roles.”



As a result, midsize organizations put themselves at greater risk by not offering to protect from personal liability the top security leader they employ.



D&amp;O for CISOs on the rise



CISOs have the potential for more than one safety net, the first of which is a company’s indemnification provisions — rules typically embedded in the company’s articles of incorporation and bylaws.



“The language of a company’s indemnification provisions must be properly worded — typically achieved by the general counsel and a board vote — to provide indemnification for a CISO equal to every other director or officer of a company,” explains John Peterson of World Insurance Associates, a provider of employment practice liability insurance.



The second safety net for a CISO is the D&amp;O liability insurance policy procured by the CISO’s company through an insurance broker. Even when a company has D&amp;O insurance in place, Peterson advises CISOs to review those policies to make sure they are covered as an “insured person.”



According to the latest IANS Research + Artico Search’s CISO Compensation Report, inclusion of CISOs in D&amp;O insurance policies is increasing.



More than 50% of CISOs in the US and Canada received this insurance benefit as part of their compensation package, according to the 2025 edition of the study. This figure is up from the 40% who said they received this protection in last year’s edition of the CISO Compensation Report.



One in 5 CISOs also reported to IANS Research that they have access to external counsel — typically for investigations or audits.



A question of indemnity



But Ryan Griffin, US cyber leader at insurance broker McGill and Partners, points out that the difference between D&amp;O insurance and a direct indemnification agreement is often misunderstood.



“The most crucial tool for a CISO’s protection is the indemnification agreement with their employer,” Griffin explains. “The D&amp;O policy is how the company pays to protect its officer, but the indemnification agreement is what actually legally guarantees that protection.”



Without a formal indemnification agreement, CISOs are at great risk, Griffin warns.



“They would be responsible for covering their own legal defense costs, forcing them to rely on personal savings or a personal umbrella insurance policy,” Griffin tells CSO. “Beyond the financial hit, their career could be severely damaged.”



Griffin adds: “An enforcement action, even if it’s ultimately dismissed, could result in penalties that bar them from serving as an officer for a public company for years, which seriously limits future job prospects.”



Blame game



Central to the issue as well is accountability, which almost always lands on the shoulders of the person perceived to be “in charge of security,” according to Kenrick Bagnall, president and co-founder of RB-Cyber Assurance.



“Whether that’s the CISO of a Fortune 500 company or the sole IT director of a 100-person manufacturing firm, when things go wrong, someone has to answer for it,” says Bagnall, a former detective constable with the Toronto Police Service.



The difference between a multinational and a midsize company isn’t the exposure, Bagnall says; it’s the resources.



While enterprise CISOs often have access to legal teams and crisis PR advisors to help shield them, a midrange firm often has one or two people — possibly more — wearing multiple hats, like compliance, IT, and security all rolled into one.



This can become an issue because “regulators, customers, and even the courts won’t lower the expectations just because the company is smaller,” Bagnall says.



“Without legal protection, CISOs face significant personal and professional risk,” Bagnall said. “They can be blamed for systemic failures outside of their control — things like legacy systems that were never budgeted for replacement, or business units that refuse to adopt security controls because they’re ‘too disruptive.’”



SolarWinds case continues to cast lingering shadow



The SEC’s 2023 lawsuit against SolarWinds’ CISO Timothy Brown over allegations that he misled investors and failed to accurately report the vendor’s cybersecurity measures is far from an isolated case. Even though the ultimate dismissal of this high-profile lawsuit eased immediate fears that many CISOs might be held personally liable for security incidents the issue has far from gone way.



“Cybersecurity leaders are increasingly held accountable for breaches and their handling of incidents,” CM Law’s Rittenberry Culhane says. “Regulatory bodies, shareholders, and courts are naming CISOs in lawsuits — even when they acted in good faith.”



Midsize companies tend to have more limited legal and compliance resources, making indemnity insurance even more important as a potential safety net for security professionals employed by midrange firms.



“D&amp;O insurance should always be obtained but that doesn’t always cover all the risk,” Rittenberry Culhane says.



Rittenberry Culhane, a former general counsel turned attorney whose practice specializes in advising corporations on risk management and insurance, offered CISOs a best practice checklist:




Confirm CISO coverage under your D&amp;O policy



Review policy limits and exclusions for cyber-related claims



Consider supplemental indemnification agreements for CISOs and security leaders



Align indemnity provisions with incident response and disclosure policies

Governance structures need revamping



The CISO role has evolved faster than the governance structures that protect it, according to RB-Cyber Assurance’s Bagnall.



“We now ask security leaders to be part strategist, part technologist, part crisis responder, and part scapegoat,” Bagnall says. “Until organizations, especially midsized ones, recognize that and build legal and contractual protections accordingly, we’ll continue to see talented leaders hesitate to take on these roles, resulting in organizations of all sizes not getting the proper tech and information security guidance they need.”



“The CISO isn’t just defending the network — they’re defending the business’s reputation, its trust, and its future,” Bagnall adds. “That responsibility deserves protection.”

The Raspberry Pi wakeup call: Why enterprises must rethink physical security,"
		
					  
						




A recent attack on a French ferry, in which an attacker reportedly plugged a tiny computer called a Raspberry Pi into the network in an attempt to break into the vessel’s operations, offers an important lesson for enterprise CISOs: one analyst estimated that half of all enterprises would likely be compromised by the same attack on their physical environment.



The ferry was “immobilized Saturday in the southern French port of Sète as it prepared to sail to Algeria” because of the attack attempt, according to a report from Bloomberg. The Raspberry Pi device “was paired with a cellular modem, enabling remote access to the ferry’s internal computer network and external connections.” 



The good news was that the attack attempt was halted because of good security procedures onboard, the story said. “Investigators said segregation between office and operational networks, along with the absence of remote access to critical controls, prevented lateral movement and ruled out sabotage or hijacking scenarios.”



Enterprise controls ‘watching the wrong roads’



The question for enterprise cybersecurity executives is how well their land-based buildings — offices, stores, gas stations, bank branches, manufacturing facilities, and so forth — would have held up under a similar physical attack. Analysts and other security experts were not optimistic about how they would have fared. 



“Most enterprise security programs are still built for the wrong kind of intruder. They are built for the person who breaks in, not the person who walks in. And the rogue device story is the clearest signal of that shift,” said Sanchit Vir Gogia, the chief analyst at Greyhound Research. “A Raspberry Pi class device with a cellular modem is not just a clever gadget, it is a way to create a new perimeter from inside your building.”



He pointed out that an attacker “does not have to fight your firewalls if they can step around them. They do not need to beat your VPN if they can bring their own internet connection into your wiring closet. That is the part that should keep CISOs awake, because it means a lot of the controls we celebrate are watching the wrong roads. If the traffic leaves through cellular, it does not cross your monitored gateways. Your SOC can be doing everything right and will still see nothing.”



Fred Chagnon, principal research director at Info-Tech Research Group, agreed with Gogia’s concerns. 



“Most offices have dozens of live Ethernet ports in lobbies, under conference tables, and in hallways. These should be administratively disabled at the switch level by default. A port should only be activated when a specific, authorized MAC address is verified via 802.1X authentication,” Chagnon said. 



He added, “modern threat actors use MAC Spoofing to make a Raspberry Pi look like a legitimate VoIP phone or printer. CISOs should invest in tools, like Sepio or advanced NACs, that perform physical layer fingerprinting. These tools analyze the electrical and timing characteristics of the hardware to detect if a ‘printer’ is actually a Linux-based implant.”



Chagnon also encouraged extensive use of port locks that require a key, and some type of tamper-evident tape over chassis and ports. “Security sweeps should include looking for extra wires, unauthorized USB hubs, or small boxes that don’t match the asset inventory,” he added. “If a door to a restricted area is opened and a new, unknown device simultaneously appears on that local switch, the SOC should receive a high-priority correlated alert.”



Forrester Senior Analyst Paddy Harrington said that many enterprise security executives “forget how susceptible these things are to attack” and specifically pointed to IoT and OT devices as prime targets. Too many security people, Harrington said, are looking at what shadow devices, such as fitness trackers, are supposed to do, and not focusing on the access the device could get as the start of a backdoor attack.



“You shouldn’t be able to walk up to an Ethernet port and plug in anything. That device needs to be authenticated,” Harrington said, adding that he estimates that 50% of all enterprises cut too many corners on device security. “Why should any IoT lightbulbs have access to financial data?” he asked.



When he confronts enterprise security leaders on physical security, he said, he gets pushback. For example, in a recent discussion about network segmentation, the executive told him, “To segment our environment to that degree is going to take a lot of time and effort, and we are redirecting our money elsewhere.”



Harrington said, “I’m sorry, but that is a poor excuse.”



However, one security executive, Flavio Villanustre, CISO for the LexisNexis Risk Solutions Group, said that these types of physical attacks can be challenging to block.



“The proliferation of inexpensive and very capable single board computers such as the Raspberry Pi have made this problem much harder. Intrusion detection in the network should have detected behavioral anomalies, but that’s easier said than done if you have a large complex network and the Raspberry Pi looks like just another normal IoT device,” Villanustre pointed out. “And this is assuming that it was even connected to the network, rather than [to] some ancient serial bus in the ship’s control systems.”



Proceed with caution



Villanustre encouraged anyone discovering such a device to proceed cautiously. 



“Disconnecting the device could result in losing important forensic information if not careful. It’s not too hard to equip the device with a tiny battery or supercapacitor that would give it enough time to wipe itself out if disconnected from the network or somehow tampered with,” Villanustre said. “Trying to send false information is even harder, because you would need to identify the protocols used by the device to know what to send. A bigger concern is if the device is connected to perhaps another device in the ship and could trigger a damaging action if tampered with. It could even detonate explosives.”



Whisper Security CEO Kaveh Ranjibar added that his advice for dealing with this kind of physical discovery is “immediate isolation and forensic analysis, but with one critical step before physical removal: map the blast radius. Before you pull the plug, capture the device’s network traffic. Who is it talking to? What domains is it querying?”



“Using infrastructure intelligence, you can often attribute the actor based on the neighborhood of the command-and-control servers they use, allowing you to understand if this is a script kiddie or a GRU operation before you touch the hardware,” Ranjibar said. 



 Ranjibar said that when such devices phone home, they may reveal a lot of usable information. 



“A rogue device like a Raspberry Pi, even with a cellular modem, isn’t invisible. It has to phone home to receive commands or exfiltrate data. It creates an infrastructure footprint: a new IP address, a DNS resolution or a connection to a specific Autonomous System Number (ASN),” Ranjibar said. 



“CISOs need to move beyond just monitoring their internal LAN,” he added. “They need continuous external infrastructure monitoring.

"Microsoft warns MSMQ may fail after update, breaking apps","
		
					  
						




A warning from Microsoft that a Windows patch issued last week may cause the Message Queuing (MSMQ) function in the operating system to malfunction could be behind multiple reports of internet of things (IoT) applications failing.



David Shipley, head of Canadian security awareness training provider Beauceron Security, says he saw a query on a Microsoft learning forum today asking if the MSMQ problem is behind the failure of a firm’s point of sale system to issue sales receipts.



Another person posted a query on a different Microsoft forum about a building in an unnamed city being without its fire alarm or smoke detector systems.



A link between these posts and the December 16 security update from Microsoft on the MSMQ issue couldn’t be confirmed. But Shipley said it is odd that Microsoft’s initial advice says that a workaround is available, but instead of detailing it, it urges admins to contact Microsoft Support For Businesses.



“The scariest words when it comes to a serious bug in Windows you’re trying to fix, that’s crashing your applications, is, ‘Call us,’” he said.



MSMQ is a protocol for secure messaging between applications, Shipley noted, so if there is a problem, “it’s going to break stuff.”



The Microsoft post says that individuals using Windows Home or Pro editions on personal devices are “very unlikely to experience this issue. This issue primarily affects enterprise or managed IT environments,” including those running clustered MSMQ environments under load.



Symptoms include:




MSMQ becoming inactive;



Internet Information Services (IIS) sites failing with “Insufficient resources to perform operation” errors;



applications unable to write to queues;



errors such as “The message file ‘C:\Windows\System32\msmq\storage*.mq’ cannot be created” when creating message files;



misleading log entries such as “There is insufficient disk space or memory”, despite sufficient disk space and memory being available.




Affected are servers running Windows Server 2019 and 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows Server 2012.



Also affected are PCs running Windows 10 version 22H2, Windows 10 version 21H2, Windows 10 version 1809, and Windows 10 version 1607. Support for Windows 10 ended October 14, so the issue should only affect these systems if admins have paid for extended support and received the December update.



This issue is caused by a December Patch Tuesday security update (KB5071546) that introduced changes to the MSMQ security model and NTFS permissions on the C:\Windows\System32\MSMQ\ storage folder. MSMQ users now require write access to this folder, which is normally restricted to administrators, says Microsoft. As a result, attempts to send messages via MSMQ APIs might fail with resource errors.



“A workaround is available for affected devices,” says the Microsoft update. “To apply the workaround and mitigate this issue in your organization, please contact Microsoft Support for business. We are investigating this issue and will provide more information when it is available.” 



Jack Bicer, director of vulnerability research at Action1, suggested as a temporary workaround for MSMQ failures that Windows admins grant write access to the MSMQ directory C:\Windows\System32\msmq. Once Microsoft provides the official update, revert the directory permissions to their original state and deploy the fix, he said.



Danny Nguyen of Wicloud suggested on a Microsoft Learn forum that admins could either roll back the December security update (KB5071546) or adjust the permissions, as Bicer suggests. However, Nguyen urged admins to consult with their security team before making system-level permission changes.



A Microsoft spokesperson was asked for comment, but no response was received by press time.



This isn’t the first MSMQ problem in recent memory; last year Microsoft discovered a remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2024-30008) that carried a criticality rating of 9.8. 



In this case, however, said Robert Beggs, head of Canadian incident response firm DigitalDefence, although the cause of the issue is a security patch, the impact and workaround are not strictly security issues. Therefore, he believes the fix is a workaround that does not involve security and security support, but regular support for a Windows system. 



As for the company’s reason for asking admins to contact Microsoft Support for Business for the workaround, he suggested that Microsoft may want to spread the workload to ensure that security support is not overworked.



More broadly, warned Shipley, any update that leads to a business application failure is the kind of issue that turns admins off patching. December is the biggest month of the year for retail, and not the time for POS machines to go down because of the installation of a new patch.

‘Ink Dragon’ threat group targets IIS servers to build stealthy global network,"
		
					  
						




A Chinese-linked threat group identified as “Ink Dragon” is targeting common weaknesses in Internet Information Services (IIS) servers to build a global espionage network that is difficult to track or disrupt, security vendor Check Point has reported.



Also nicknamed “Earth Alux,” (Trend Mico) and “REF7707” (Elastic Security Labs), the group’s activities date back to early 2023, at which time it targeted governments in Southeast Asia and South America. This has since expanded to target European countries.



Ink Dragon might sound similar in its modus operandi to several other Chinese threat groups engaged in nation-state surveillance, such as UNC6384, whose campaigns targeted European diplomats.



However, during a recent investigation at the office of a European government, Check Point said it had discovered that the group has now pivoted towards what it called “an unusually sophisticated playbook” with longer term goals.



Key to this is IIS, Microsoft’s aging web server platform, which is still present in many networks, especially those in the public sector. This platform holds two attractions: it is widely deployed, and is often misconfigured and insecure.



The campaign begins when attackers compromise an IIS server, gain access to the internal network where they harvest local credentials, study admin sessions, using these and Microsoft Remote Desktop to move laterally without attracting attention. At this point, the group installs a customized IIS module that turns the server into an invisible “quiet” relay inside the group’s wider global infrastructure.



“These servers forward commands and data between different victims, creating a communication mesh that hides the true origin of the attack traffic,” explain Check Point’s researchers.



Shadow infrastructure



The attack has two goals: to compromise government servers and plunder their networks for intelligence while, secondly, borrowing them to relay attack traffic to and from other compromised servers in a way that makes detecting the group’s command &amp; control (C2) much harder.



This tactic cleverly dodges the problem of having to rely on conventional C2 infrastructure which is vulnerable to takedown and disruption. Instead, the hijacked and trusted government servers become the infrastructure.



“Across incidents, the same story repeats. A small web facing issue becomes the first step. A series of quiet pivots leads to domain level control. The environment is then repurposed as part of a larger network that powers operations against additional targets,” said Check Point. As to the traffic itself, the group hides communication inside ordinary mailbox drafts, making it look like everyday communication.



Coincidentally, Check Point found that a second Chinese threat group, RudePanda, was simultaneously exploiting IIS weaknesses to compromise government servers. This meant that RudePanda “ended up operating in the same [compromised] environments at the same time.”



The discoveries underscore the issue of IIS misconfiguration. Beyond listing the group’s indicators of compromise (IoCs), Check Points offers no specific advice on how to counter this. Nevertheless, some actions suggest themselves: audit the modules running on IIS against a known good baseline, enable advanced IIS logging, configure IIS to make common view state vulnerabilities less likely, and consider putting IIS servers behind a web application firewall (WAF).

China reportedly has a prototype EUV machine built by ex-ASML employees,"A report from Reuters claims that scientists in China have created a prototype of a machine that could eventually be used to produce semiconductor chips capable of powering artificial intelligence. Sources told the publication that a team in Shenzhen completed the prototype of an extreme ultraviolet lithography machine earlier this year and it is allegedly now undergoing testing. The EUV machine was reportedly made by former engineers from Dutch semiconductor supplier ASML. Reuters states that China is targeting production of its own EUV chips beginning in 2028, although other experts have projected 2030 as a more likely date. EUV is a supremely complicated bit of technology; we have an explainer below that gets into some of the details. It is at the heart of the chips made by companies such as Intel and TSMC, so any company trying to compete would also need access to EUV. Although the Chinese prototype is not yet making chips, it is reportedly able to generate the extreme ultraviolet light needed for chip manufacturing.If confirmed, this development would put China in control of tech much sooner than analysts had previously expected. To date, EUV has largely been kept out of reach by Western companies and used as a bargaining chip by the US government. Chinese President Xi Jinping has placed a high priority on the country being able to produce its own semiconductors. &#34;The aim is for China to eventually be able to make advanced chips on machines that are entirely China-made,&#34; a source told Reuters. &#34;China wants the United States 100 percent kicked out of its supply chains.&#34;This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/china-reportedly-has-a-prototype-euv-machine-built-by-ex-asml-employees-235833756.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2022-10%2F133702d0-46e9-11ed-bf7f-a4d82f39fc75&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=50cf297e0fb441fc3a1ad49f4095dfded8036319,https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/china-reportedly-has-a-prototype-euv-machine-built-by-ex-asml-employees-235833756.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-17T23:58:33Z,12,Tech

A Facebook test makes link-sharing a paid feature for creators,"Creators and publishers have long worried about Meta&#39;s ability to throttle links to outside content. Now, the company is testing out a new scheme that effectively puts link-sharing behind a paywall for creators on Facebook.Under the test, a Meta Verified subscription will determine how many links a creator can share another profile per month. According to a screenshot shared by social meda consultant Matt Navarra, creators in the test recently received a notification from Meta informing them that &#34;certain Facebook profiles without Meta Verified, including yours, will be limited to sharing links in 2 organic posts per month.&#34;  Meta is making link sharing pay to play with a new test.A spokesperson for Meta confirmed the test to Engadget. The test is currently affecting an unspecified number of creators and pages using &#34;professional mode&#34; on Facebook. Publishers aren&#39;t affected for now. &#34;This is a limited test to understand whether the ability to publish an increased volume of posts with links adds additional value for Meta Verified subscribers,&#34; the spokesperson said.While Meta seems to be trying to downplay the significance of the test, it&#39;s a notable shift for the company. Many creators and businesses rely on Facebook and reducing their ability to send traffic to outside websites could be a significant hit. Many creators are already frustrated that the company puts its better customer service features behind the Meta Verified subscription, which starts at $14.99/month. Making link-sharing a premium feature as well would be even more unpopular. Have a tip for Karissa?

Astronomers find mysterious lemon-shaped exoplanet with NASA's Webb telescope,"Space is full of unsolved mysteries, and a team using NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope have recently turned up a doozy. &#34;I remember after we got the data down, our collective reaction was &#39;What the heck is this?&#39; It&#39;s extremely different from what we expected,&#34; said Peter Gao of the Carnegie Earth and Planets Laboratory in Washington, a co-author on the study. The researchers found an exoplanet dubbed PSR J2322-2650b that orbits a small, dense star emitting electromagnetic radiation known as a pulsar. They are an example of a black widow system, where a rapidly spinning pulsar is paired with a smaller astronomical body. A black widow duo isn’t unusual, but this pair has sparked questions about how the exoplanet originally formed. The exoplanet&#39;s proximity to the pulsar and its intense gravitational pull have distorted it into an oblong lemon shape. More unusually, PSR J2322-2650b also has a unique atmosphere comprised mostly of helium and carbon. &#34;Instead of finding the normal molecules we expect to see on an exoplanet — like water, methane, and carbon dioxide — we saw molecular carbon,&#34; principal investigator Michael Zhang of University of Chicago said. Given its strange atmosphere, the team isn&#39;t certain how the exoplanet formed. &#34;It&#39;s very hard to imagine how you get this extremely carbon-enriched composition. It seems to rule out every known formation mechanism,&#34; Zhang said. For now, we’ll chalk this up as another mystery of the universe.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/astronomers-find-mysterious-lemon-shaped-exoplanet-with-nasas-webb-telescope-223722244.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2FNASA_black_widow_pulsar.jpg&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=b609b2fdf71c81142d7019c33f2dbca10ffeabda,https://www.engadget.com/science/space/astronomers-find-mysterious-lemon-shaped-exoplanet-with-nasas-webb-telescope-223722244.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-17T22:37:22Z,7,Tech

Jared Isaacman is NASA's new leader,"NASA has a leader again. On Wednesday, the US Senate confirmed Jared Isaacman as the agency&#39;s administrator, with a 67-30 vote. The billionaire entrepreneur (and Elon Musk ally) will have his hands full navigating political waters while managing a severely downsized workforce.You might recall that this wasn&#39;t Isaacman&#39;s first shot at the job. He was nominated to the post earlier this year. But days before he was scheduled for a confirmation vote, President Donald Trump withdrew his nomination.The reversal reportedly came after the president was told that Isaacman had donated to prominent Democrats. (Trump’s description of his decision, as based on a &#34;thorough review of prior associations,&#34; seemed to lend weight to that.) However, that was also around the time the Trump-Musk feud was about to boil over.  Regardless, Isaacman was nominated again in November.The new NASA head reportedly has broad support from the space community. (That makes him something of an aberration among Trump appointees in scientific fields.) &#34;I am optimistic that Mr. Isaacman will bring a steady hand and clear vision to NASA,&#34; Sen.

"Billboard's charts are increasingly weighted towards on-demand streaming, but not enough for YouTube","YouTube announced that it will no longer share data with Billboard for the creation of the Billboard Hot 100 and other charts because the video platform doesn&#39;t believe they&#39;re calculated fairly. The issue lies, per YouTube, with how Billboard weighs on-demand streams in its rankings: The publication weighs streams from paid music streaming services over ad-supported streams, and YouTube just so happens to run an ad-supported streaming service.Much like getting a book on The New York Times Bestseller list, landing a spot on the Billboard charts doesn&#39;t carry quite the same importance that it once did. When the majority of the media people consume is digital and on-demand, sales numbers aren&#39;t a guaranteed indicator of success or popularity. That&#39;s part of the reason why Billboard started including digital streams in its calculations way back in 2007, and why it announced plans to adjust how it weighs on-demand streaming just yesterday.On Tuesday, Billboard announced that it would add more weight to streaming to &#34;better reflect an increase in streaming revenue and changing consumer behaviors.&#34; Billboard currently counts an &#34;album consumption unit&#34; as an album sale, which either breaks down to &#34;3,750 ad-supported or 1,250 paid/subscription on-demand official audio and video streams.&#34; In the new ranking scheme that will go into effect in January 2026, &#34;each album consumption unit will now equal 2,500 ad-supported or 1,000 paid/subscription on-demand official audio and video streams.&#34; &#34;The change means that it will take 33.3 percent fewer ad-supported on-demand streams of songs from an album, and 20 percent fewer paid/subscription on-demand streams of songs from an album, to equal an album unit,&#34; Billboard says. Put another way, things are moving in YouTube’s favor, just apparently not as quickly as the company wants.YouTube characterizes pulling its data from Billboard as fighting for fairness and equality, but it&#39;s equally connected to the platform’s demonstration of its own power. It already funnels billions of dollars to artists and labels from the money it makes on ads and subscriptions, but it clearly also wants the power to mint new chart-topping stars. “We are committed to achieving equitable representation across the charts and hopefully can work with Billboard to return to theirs,” YouTube says in its announcement. “Until then, if you&#39;re curious about what music is making waves on YouTube, you can visit our charts here.”This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/billboards-charts-are-increasingly-weighted-towards-on-demand-streaming-but-not-enough-for-youtube-220238291.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2024-01%2F75228100-c13f-11ee-9df7-61be1ecc9366&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=af061c4319178bddfa5b388b2bf1fce2c095a62f,https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/billboards-charts-are-increasingly-weighted-towards-on-demand-streaming-but-not-enough-for-youtube-220238291.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-17T22:02:38Z,7,Tech

The first post-EA FIFA soccer sim will be a Netflix Games exclusive,"FIFA&#39;s first true soccer sim after the end of its EA partnership will be available exclusively on Netflix, the streaming service announced. This &#34;reimagined FIFA football simulation game&#34; will be developed and published by Delphi Interactive, and be available to Netflix subscribers next year, right in time for FIFA World Cup 2026.EA and FIFA maintained a nearly 30 year partnership creating soccer games before they parted ways in 2022. EA continued its soccer series afterward as EA FC, but despite being in talks with &#34;leading game publishers, media companies and investors&#34; about &#34;a major new FIFA simulation football game title for 2024,&#34; a FIFA-backed competitor has yet to materialize. Instead, FIFA has mostly supported arcade soccer games in the last few years, like FIFA Rivals from Mythical Games and FIFA Heroes from ENVER.While the game Delphi Interactive is working on is pitched as a &#34;simulation game,&#34; based on what little detail appears in Netflix&#39;s announcement, it doesn&#39;t sound like it&#39;s targeting hardcore soccer fans in the same way EA&#39;s games do. Instead, this new FIFA title is designed to be &#34;a game that anyone, anywhere, can pick up and instantly feel the magic of football,&#34; according to Delphi Interactive CEO Caspar Daugaard. The game will also be designed to use a smartphone as a controller, possibly limiting how demanding or complicated gameplay can actually be.This new FIFA game will be Delphi Interactive&#39;s second project as a studio after working on IO Interactive&#39;s 007 First Light. Backing approachable games that can be controlled with a smartphone is part of a new approach Netflix has taken with its interactive titles in 2025. The company has either cancelled or handed off its more ambitious game projects and studios, and zeroed in on party games and adaptations as its main focus.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-first-post-ea-fifa-soccer-sim-will-be-a-netflix-games-exclusive-204321196.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2FFIFA-Netflix.jpg&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=a773a3fbe1f3b3f3750979a1cd4fe09ced75c7fc,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-first-post-ea-fifa-soccer-sim-will-be-a-netflix-games-exclusive-204321196.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-17T20:43:21Z,7,Tech

"Study links Amazon's algorithmic pricing with erratic, inflated costs for school districts","When it comes to convenience, it’s hard to beat Amazon. And that rationale isn’t limited to consumers: Many local districts shopping for supplies with public funds apply the same logic. But the Institute for Local Self-Reliance (ILSR) published a study earlier this month (via The American Prospect) that illustrates the cost of that bargain. It suggests that Amazon’s “dynamic pricing” has led many schools and other localities to overpay for supplies.Public schools and local governments have historically bought supplies by soliciting competitive bids from local suppliers. Those vendors then respond with fixed price lists, delivery timelines and other terms. This competition — all out in the open, part of the public record — encourages low prices and transparency.On the surface, ordering from Amazon appears to offer competition, too. After all, the platform includes third-party vendors fighting for your dollars. But turning taxpayer funds over to Amazon’s algorithms isn’t quite that simple. That’s because the platform’s “dynamic pricing” (algorithmically driven real-time changes) is inherently opaque.According to the report, Amazon’s contracts with public entities don’t include fixed price lists. Instead, they include language built around swings. “This contract has a dynamic pricing structure in which the price for items listed on the online digital marketplace is driven by the market,” Amazon’s contract with Utah reads. “This contract will not need to be amended when prices fluctuate.”Below are some examples of wild price discrepancies for these districts. All of ILSR’s examples are from localities buying supplies from Amazon Business with public funds in 2023.A City of Boulder, CO employee ordered a 12-pack of Sharpie markers from Amazon Business for $8.99. On the same day, a Denver Public Schools worker ordered the same markers for $28.63.Amazon charged Clark County, WA, $146,000 for 610 computer monitors. On another day, that same order would have cost $24,000 less.Pittsburgh Schools bought two cases of Kleenex for $57.99 each. On the same day, Denver Schools paid $36.91 for a single case.On a single August day, Denver Schools placed two separate orders for bulk cases of dry-erase markers. One cost $114.52. The other was $149.07.In March 2023, Denver Schools paid $15.39 for a Swingline stapler (sold by Amazon). A few days later, the same school system paid $61.87 for the same product (sold by a third-party seller).Even in that last example, ILSR says Amazon’s algorithms are the culprit. “It might be tempting to blame the seller for putting a $62 price tag on a stapler or the employee for not noticing the cost,” the nonprofit argues. “But that overlooks Amazon’s pivotal role in the transaction — and the profit it makes. Amazon’s algorithms steer shoppers’ attention, selecting featured products and organizing search results. The platform routinely prompts users to ‘buy it again,’ even when the price has jumped. For busy public school employees, it’s all too easy to simply click the buy button, under the assumption that Amazon is surfacing the best option.”Amazon CEO Andy JassyNoah Berger via Getty ImagesOne portion of the study looked at repeat orders for 2,500 “high-frequency items.” (These included Amazon-brand copy paper, Elmer’s glue, BIC pens, Lysol cleaning wipes and Crayola crayons.) In total, the jurisdictions in the study spent $3 million on those items. But based on the lowest prices Amazon charged during that period, they would have paid only $2.5 million. Across those same items, one school district could have saved 17 percent (about $1 million) if it consistently received Amazon’s lowest prices.What would fair market value have been for those items? Well, it’s hard to say because the algorithms are steering pricing silently in the background. A more thorough study that included the same items, bought exclusively through the traditional procurement method, would tell us much more. And recent history has taught us that trusting Big Tech’s algorithms to serve the public good (rather than its own bottom line) is a fool’s errand.In at least some cases, the practice routes public funds away from local vendors and toward overseas ones — and, of course, Amazon itself. In Berkeley County, WV, the school district spent $1.3 million on Amazon Business in 2023. What portion went to sellers in the state? A measly $142.On top of all of that, the practice has snuffed out many of the smaller vendors that traditionally competed for these contracts. “The disappearance of these small and mid-sized businesses weakens local economies and tax bases,” the report concludes. “And it leaves governments increasingly dependent on Amazon, paving the way for the kind of monopoly control that ensures higher prices, poorer service, and less innovation.”In a statement sent to The Guardian, Amazon disputed the study’s conclusions. “Pricing research is notoriously difficult to conduct accurately and typically lacks reliable methodology, including cherry-picked product selections, mismatched product comparisons and comparing in-stock items with products out-of-stock at competitors,”ILSR’s report drew in spending data from 128 local governments (including cities, counties and school districts) and 122 state agencies. It also gathered contract documents and interviewed public officials, procurement experts and vendors.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/study-links-amazons-algorithmic-pricing-with-erratic-inflated-costs-for-school-districts-202047988.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2Fbryan-angelo-FtiXADBTqGY-unsplash.jpg&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=51f2df152a922ffcc5dacd5a864c08a09ff99941,https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/study-links-amazons-algorithmic-pricing-with-erratic-inflated-costs-for-school-districts-202047988.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-17T20:20:47Z,12,Tech

Meta is 'pausing' third-party VR headsets from ASUS and Lenovo,"Last year, Meta announced that it was opening up its VR operating system to other headset makers, starting with ASUS and Lenovo. Now, it seems that Meta is pumping the brakes on the effort and those third-party Horizon OS headsets might never actually launch.The company has &#34;paused&#34; the program,  Road to VR  reported. Meta confirmed the move in a statement to Engadget, saying that it&#39;s instead focusing on &#34;building the world-class first-party hardware and software needed to advance the VR market.&#34; ASUS and Lenovo didn&#39;t immediately respond to a request for comment. Both companies have said little about the headsets since they were first announced in 2024. ASUS&#39; was going to be a &#34;performance gaming&#34; headset under its Republic of Gamers (ROG) brand, while Lenovo&#39;s was intended to be  a mixed reality device focused on &#34;productivity, learning and entertainment&#34; experiences The shift isn&#39;t entirely surprising. Meta Connect was very light on virtual reality news this year as smart glasses have become a central focus for the company. Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported that Meta was planning significant cuts to the teams working on virtual reality and Horizon Worlds. The company said at the time it was &#34;shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward AI glasses and wearables given the momentum there.&#34;Still, Meta is seemingly leaving the door open for third-party VR headsets in the future. &#34;We’re committed to this for the long term and will revisit opportunities for 3rd-party device partnerships as the category evolves,&#34; the company said.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/meta-is-pausing-third-party-vr-headsets-from-asus-and-lenovo-193622900.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2Fmeta_vr_.jpg&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=37e3aa61f980411ce63c88c23ed466eb73e64752,https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/meta-is-pausing-third-party-vr-headsets-from-asus-and-lenovo-193622900.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-17T19:36:22Z,12,Tech

This cute little Behringer synthesizer sounds massive and costs just $49,"Behringer is no stranger to remaking classic synthesizers and selling them at much cheaper price points. However, this latest release may just take the budget-friendly cake. The company just introduced the UB-1 Micro, previously called the Spirit, a portable analog synth inspired by the Oberheim Matrix line that costs just $49.
Despite the price tag, this thing still manages to sound extremely beefy. It features a pair of digitally controlled oscillators (DCOs) based on the Oberheim Matrix 6 analog chip. The monophonic/duophonic synth boasts two LFOs to control filters and tuning and an arpeggiator with three patterns and a hold function.

It also offers 32 factory presets, which is expandable via the company&#39;s SynthTribe software. The UB-1 Micro includes 16 touch-sensitive keys, six function buttons and an OLED display for editing parameters. There&#39;s a USB-C port, for connecting to smartphones and computers. To that end, it can do USB/MIDI.
This is just the latest teensy recreation by Behringer. The UB-Xa Mini is a take on another Oberheim classic and a portable version of its own full-size UB-Xa synthesizer. The JT Mini recreates an iconic Roland Jupiter synth, while the Phara-o Mini is primarily based on the Korg Volca Keys.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/this-cute-little-behringer-synthesizer-sounds-massive-and-costs-just-49-191513007.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2Fb391ca40-db78-11f0-bbff-174c75e3e6dd&resize=1400%2C811&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=99f07c8400fe90ddd627eb1ec19088abf08e5fb2,https://www.engadget.com/audio/this-cute-little-behringer-synthesizer-sounds-massive-and-costs-just-49-191513007.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-17T19:15:13Z,8,Tech

IO Interactive's 007 First Light reimagines James Bond as a young and reckless spy,"The creators of the Hitman series have honed their style of- open-ended and spectacle-driven sandboxes across several games, and now they&#39;re taking their signature immersive gameplay to the world of James Bond. With 007 First Light, developer IO Interactive is crafting an origin story for the globetrotting British spy, showing how he undertook daring missions at the start of his career to eventually become the world&#39;s most infamous agent.Before the reveal at The Game Awards of 007 First Light&#39;s newest villain, played by Lenny Kravitz, we had an early look at the latest bits of plot for James Bond&#39;s origin story as a superspy. We also spoke with cinematic and narrative director Martin Emborg about the main inspirations for the game, how Bond&#39;s origin taps into decades of lore, and why a good spy story is timeless.&#34;What I think is kind of baked into doing an origin story for a character like James Bond, is that everyone knows the character and who he&#39;s going to become,&#34; Emborg said. &#34;But how does he become this character? I think that&#39;s an exciting challenge from a storytelling perspective.&#34;IO Interactive&#39;s James Bond is young and inexperienced.IO InteractiveWhile some Bond films and novels have touched upon the early years of the iconic character, 007 First Light will be the first attempt at an actual, modernized origin story. As a twenty-something new MI6 recruit, this James Bond, portrayed by Patrick Gibson, is inexperienced and brash, which can result in some operations going off the rails. He still possesses a certain cunning, and near-supernatural levels of charisma and resourcefulness. This presents a solid archetype for the game’s open-ended missions where players will explore tightly designed worlds with a multitude of tasks and objectives to handle – however the players see fit.While IO Interactive&#39;s Hitman series taps into the spy experience, what really separates James Bond from Agent 47 is that he&#39;s a far more social character. The social element will play a big part in how players can find ways to distract, or even outright bluff through charisma to sneak into areas.. Emborg explained that James Bond&#39;s resourcefulness also makes him a compelling character for a video game, especially one that is all about player agency.007 First Light will take players to several locations, including Slovakia and what appears to be Vietnam.IO Interactive&#34;Bond is a competent character,” Emborg said. “We want to give the player the opportunities to have that agency to say, &#39;Oh, I&#39;m gonna talk to that guy,&#39; or, &#39;I&#39;m gonna go and punch that guy,’ or, ‘I can probably crawl up into a tight space to sneak in.&#39; Having that sense of agency is pivotal if you want to deliver a full Bond experience. Obviously, the social aspect of that is important; to embed yourself and infiltrate socially is a big part of that Bond experience.&#34; Emborg said the rhythm of a James Bond game is different from a Hitman title, even though espionage, infiltration and subterfuge are at the core of both. &#34;We have a lot of experience with that from obviously making Hitman, but there are just many more gears to Bond,” he said. “Of course, the shape of this game is different. We have sandbox locations where you make the open-ended decisions, but we also have other levels where it is a chase or a set-piece encounter, and then it opens up again. So we kind of coined the term, having a game that breathes. It&#39;s a very different way of playing this type of game that we usually do, so we&#39;ve definitely bolstered our toolbox for this game.&#34;In many ways, 007 First Light is a story that can only be told in an interactive format. The new game will pull from numerous novels and films for its plot, and it also features a large cast of familiar characters seen throughout the franchise – such as MI6 assistant Moneypenny (performed by Kiera Lester), gadget guru and quartermaster Q (played by Alastair Mackenzie), and team leader M (Priyanga Burford). But like any singular Bond story, First Light features its own set of original characters. In addition to James Bond&#39;s MI6 mentor John Greenway (portrayed by Lennie James), a new core villain, black-market smuggler and warlord Bawma, will be played by Lenny Kravitz. It&#39;s a familiar setup for a Bond experience for sure, but within the context of a video game – one made by IO Interactive – it really taps looks to tap into the Bond fantasy more than other games have. From the gameplay demos and trailers we&#39;ve seen, IO Interactive looks to be channeling the style and lore from decades of Bond with its modernized reboot of the character. From deep cuts to On Her Majesty&#39;s Secret Service – one of the great and underrated Bond movies – and You Only Live Twice, 007 First Light is keeping a keen eye on paying tribute to what came before.&#34;At the very beginning, it was very much like a maelstrom of [ideas], then suddenly something emerges, and you build up a story around it,&#34; Emborg said. He continued, “I love doing this stuff and with great reverence for the material. It&#39;s a privilege to work in this universe. James Bond is one of the few IPs that still hasn&#39;t been overdone, in my view. We have a space to come in with a fresh take, and he&#39;s a character who&#39;s seen a lot of versions over the years.&#34;Confirmed MI6 gadgets include the &#34;Q-Watch.&#34;IO InteractiveSo far, 007 First Light has the makings of not only the biggest Bond game but also the most true-to-life simulation of being a superspy. While previous Bond games like Goldeneye and Everything or Nothing are well-loved classics, they embody traditional video game shooting spectacle. 007 First Light is looking to lean into the immersive element of the Hitman games in its adaptation of James Bond, finally giving players the opportunities to explore the social aspects of spy work on a grand scale. 007 First Light will arrive on March 27, 2026, for PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/io-interactives-007-first-light-reimagines-james-bond-as-a-young-and-reckless-spy-180000758.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2F007FirstLight_Screenshots_3.jpg&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=5ebbd497c8de8329d478cb391f5a81a4212e9687,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/io-interactives-007-first-light-reimagines-james-bond-as-a-young-and-reckless-spy-180000758.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-17T18:00:00Z,7,Tech

One of our favorite budgeting apps has 50 percent off annual subscriptions right now,"With a new year just around the corner, now is the perfect time to take stock of your finances. A budgeting app can help with that, and right now you can get 50 percent off your first year of a Monarch Money plan. All you need to do is enter the code MONARCHVIP at checkout and you’ll pay $50 for the initial 12 months instead of the regular price of $100. Note that the offer only applies to new users. 

  
Monarch Money was the runner-up in our guide to the best budgeting apps in 2025, and it was definitely a grower. Initially we found the experience of using the app to be needlessly complicated compared to some of its rivals, but get over that hurdle and it’s impressively fully-featured. There are plenty of customization options, a helpful “goals” feature and a thorough month-in-review recap that beats out similar features from some of its competitors. We also like how you can grant account access to others. 
Besides the steep learning curve, we also noted that the mobile app is less intuitive to use than the web version, which might pose a problem if you were hoping to do most of your accounting on the go. We also had some issues with the app failing to distinguish between bills and other recurring expenses, as well as a few bugs along the way. 
All things considered, Monarch is definitely one of our favorite budgeting apps, only being beaten out by Quicken Simplifi. As you might expect, the biggest strength of Simplifi is its simplicity, and how it eases you into using its various features. If you value that kind of user experience, it might be a better choice for you, but there’s unfortunately no free trial to take advantage of.

Uber and DoorDash challenge NYC law that encourages tipping,"Uber and DoorDash are challenging a forthcoming NYC law that encourages tipping on food-delivery apps, as reported by The New York Times. The two entities have filed a joint federal lawsuit just ahead of the ruling going into effect next month.
Back in 2023, many food delivery apps in the city moved the tip suggestion box to after purchases had been completed. This is sort of how rideshare apps work. It followed NYC mandating a minimum pay rate for food delivery workers, the first in the country. The new law simply switches the tip suggestion box back to checkout, with a suggestion of ten percent. Customers are still free to set it to zero, if that&#39;s their thing.
The two companies say this law violates the First Amendment by requiring them to &#34;speak a government-mandated message.&#34; They also say the rule would cause customers to use the app less because they were suffering from &#34;tipping fatigue.&#34; As a customer of food delivery apps, I am not stricken with tipping fatigue. I have, however, come down with a serious case of &#34;what are all of these mysterious fees on my bill and why is my burrito $45?&#34; fatigue.
NYC food delivery workers have experienced a sharp decline in tips since the apps switched the suggestion field to after a purchase has been completed. It&#39;s extremely easy to ignore an app notification while in a food coma on the couch.
&#34;Removing the tipping option is to keep workers in poverty and make them depend on taking more orders,&#34; said Ligia Guallpa, co-founder of Workers Justice Project.
Food delivery in the city is still booming. New Yorkers spent more than $265 million on restaurant deliveries in the first half of 2025, which is up from $183 million during the same period in 2022. Current estimates suggest that there are around 80,000 delivery workers in NYC.
This particular law became a small part of the city&#39;s recent mayoral campaign. Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani said during the campaign that he supported giving customers the option to tip at checkout. DoorDash donated $1 million to his rival, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/uber-and-doordash-challenge-nyc-law-that-encourages-tipping-163315375.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F4c881f80-db63-11f0-9f04-91420d7e3498&resize=1400%2C920&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=1bccb5716446b9c99665e1cdd1e28f93a4c5bbf1,https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/uber-and-doordash-challenge-nyc-law-that-encourages-tipping-163315375.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-17T16:33:15Z,8,Tech

Google's Gemini 3 Flash model outperforms GPT-5.2 in some benchmarks,"Almost exactly a month after the debut of Gemini 3 Pro in November, Google has begun rolling out the more efficient Flash version of its latest AI model. According to the company, the new system offers similar &#34;pro-grade&#34; reasoning performance as its flagship model at a fraction of the cost, making it ideal for everyday use. In benchmarks, the new system performed significantly better than Google&#39;s previous generation models, including Gemini 2.5 Pro. More notably, in Google’s testing it managed to trade blows with GPT-5.2, the model OpenAI rushed out to counter Gemini 3 Pro. A table comparing Gemini 3 Flash&#39;s performance across a variety of AI benchmarks. GoogleFor example, in the tough Humanity&#39;s Last Exam suite, Gemini 3 Flash scored less than a percentage point worse than GPT-5.2 when neither model had access to tools like web search. In a handful of other benchmarks, Google&#39;s more efficient system even managed to outperform OpenAI&#39;s latest. For instance, in MMMU-Pro, a benchmark designed to test a model&#39;s multimodal understanding and reasoning, it edged out GPT-5.2 with a result of 81.2 percent compared to 79.5 percent. Of course, benchmarks only tell a partial story; we&#39;ll have to see what people think once both systems are broadly available. Still, the fact Gemini 3 Flash is even close to GPT-5.2, and the &#34;Extra High&#34; reasoning mode at that, is a worrying sign for OpenAI.   As with Gemini 3 Pro, Google is rolling out the new model to both the Gemini App and AI Mode in Search where it will be the default model for both services. &#34;That means all of our Gemini users globally will get access to the Gemini 3 experience at no cost, giving their everyday tasks a major upgrade,&#34; Google explains. While on the subject of AI Mode, it&#39;s now possible to access Nano Banana Pro, Google&#39;s latest image generator, directly from the chatbot. Provided you live in the US, select &#34;Thinking with 3 Pro,&#34; followed by &#34;Create Images Pro&#34; from the model picker.

OnePlus 15R review: A 165Hz display and big battery for $700,"I know what you&#39;re thinking, didn&#39;t OnePlus release a new phone just last month? It did. A little over five weeks after the announcement of the OP15, the company is back with the OnePlus 15R, a more affordable version of its new flagship that starts at $700 (or $200 less than its sibling). Off the top, this will be a shorter review because most of what I said about the OnePlus 15 also applies to the OP15R. It&#39;s a great phone that asks you to make one pretty significant compromise. 

 
Design and display

 
 
  The OnePlus 15R&#39;s screen is slightly cooler than that of the OnePlus 15. 
 
 
  Igor Bonifacic for Engadget
 

Like the OnePlus 15, the 15R looks like the OnePlus 13s and 13T, a pair of smaller, 6.32-inch phones the company released in India and China this past spring. I said the design of the OP15 was boring and derivative of the iPhone 16 Pro. The 15R has done nothing to change that opinion. With one fewer camera, the OP15R doesn&#39;t look much different from the iPhone 12 I&#39;ve been hanging on to since 2020. 
That said, I&#39;m more fond of the 15R&#39;s mint breeze color (the phone is also available in charcoal black) than the sand storm shade of my OP15. We&#39;re big fans of minty phones here at Engadget, and OnePlus has gone with a particularly pleasing hue of the color with its new phone. With the redesign, OnePlus has also improved the phone&#39;s waterproofing, bringing it in line with the OP15. The new handset is IP69K-certified against moisture and dust, meaning it can withstand heated water shot at it at pressure. Like the OP15, the 15R trades OnePlus&#39; old Alert Slider for a new Plus Key. It functions like the iPhone&#39;s Action button, allowing you to add a shortcut for a favorite feature. For example, you can configure it to open the camera app or act as a do not disturb toggle, among a few other options.  
One departure from the OP15 is that the 15R has a larger 6.83-inch display, making it slightly taller than its sibling. OnePlus is marketing this as one reason buyers might pick the 15R over the OP15, but holding the phones side by side, there&#39;s not much difference between the two. They&#39;re both big, and you&#39;ll either like that or won&#39;t.
On top of being big, the 15R&#39;s screen can refresh at a fast 165Hz in games. The two displays are also comparable in terms of resolution and brightness; both can push 1,800 nits of brightness. One difference I noticed is the OnePlus 15 has a warmer panel, even when the two phones are set to the same colorspace. I&#39;ve reached out to OnePlus to find what might be causing the disparity, but for now it may be due to a quality control issue or oversight in the company&#39;s software.  
One last thing, OnePlus has upgraded the 15R to add an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor beneath the screen. This is placed in a nice spot toward the bottom third of the display, and it&#39;s fast and accurate.   
Performance and battery

 
 
  The OnePlus 15R is also slightly thinner than the OnePlus 15.
 
 
  Igor Bonifacic for Engadget
 

The OnePlus 15R is the first phone in North America to arrive with Qualcomm&#39;s latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 chipset. Not to be confused with the Snapdragon Gen 5 Elite in the OP15, this new chipset is similar to Qualcomm&#39;s flagship system-on-a-chip but has a weaker CPU and GPU. This is reflected in benchmarks like Geekbench 6 where the OP15 handily outperforms the OP15R. It&#39;s not even close, either, with the OP15 delivering standout single- and multi-core scores of 3,773 and 11,293, while the 15R put up more modest results of 2,857 and 9,512. 
From that perspective, you&#39;re losing a fair amount of performance, but real-world use tells a different story. Outside of the handful of games such as Call of Duty: Mobile and PUBG that support the OP15 and 15R&#39;s 165Hz displays, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 offers more than enough muscle for the majority of applications. Even for most games (like the ones I like to play, including Diablo Immortal and League of Legends: Wild Rift), the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 is a great match. 
OnePlus also hasn&#39;t skimped on the 15R&#39;s other internal components. You&#39;re still getting 12GB of LPDDR5X Ultra RAM and 256GB of UFS 4.1 storage. That&#39;s the same configuration as the base model of the OP15. This translates to a phone that doesn&#39;t miss a beat when switching between apps and loading files like images and videos.  
The 15R has a slightly bigger battery, coming in at 7,400mAh, up from 7,300mAh on the OP15. In practice, the two phones offer the same amount of battery life. Putting them through both Engadget&#39;s video rundown test, they both ran for 38 hours before their batteries died (which makes sense given the OP15R has a bigger screen). Like the OP15, the 15R comes with the OnePlus 55W SUPERVOOC charger in the box. The adapter can get the 15R from dead to 100 percent in less than an hour. If you hate charging your phone, the 15R makes that process as painless as possible, with a battery that both lasts long and won&#39;t be at the outlet for hours.            
Cameras

  Igor Bonifacic for Engadget
 

By this point you&#39;re probably wondering what OnePlus cut from the OP15 to make the 15R more affordable. The answer — quite literally — is an entire camera. The new phone is missing a telephoto camera, something you could find on its predecessor, the OnePlus 13R. And as far as I can tell, the two remaining cameras use the same 50-megapixel and 8MP sensors OnePlus shipped on last year&#39;s model. The company also hasn&#39;t upgraded the glass on either camera. That leaves the selfie camera as the only area to see some change in the form of a sharper 32MP sensor and the addition of autofocus.       
Unfortunately, none of the 15R&#39;s cameras stand out. As a whole, they suffer from the same set of problems that plague the OnePlus 15&#39;s cameras. They&#39;re fine out on a sunny day, but as soon as the light becomes a bit challenging, the 15R struggles with shadow details, resulting in muddy pictures. The more I&#39;ve used both the OP15 and 15R, the more I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that OnePlus needs to go back to the drawing board with its new Detail Max Engine. It feels like it&#39;s holding back what should, at least on paper, be solid hardware.
Software

 
 
  Despite it&#39;s large size, the OnePlus 15R isn&#39;t too heavy. 
 
 
  Igor Bonifacic for Engadget
 

There&#39;s not much to say here other than the 15R ships with OxygenOS 16, just like the OP15. OnePlus has also promised to support the 15R for the same amount of time as the OP15: four years with software updates and six years with security patches. That&#39;s a shorter window than Google and Samsung, both of which promise seven years on all their latest phones. It&#39;s hopefully something that OnePlus decides to change starting with the OnePlus 16. The reason I bring that up is that the company’s version of Android is one I like a lot. OxygenOS is slick, with animations that highlight the speed of the 15R&#39;s processor and display. The fact the phone comes with the latest version of OxygenOS means you also get access to all of the company&#39;s newest AI features, including its Mind Space hub where you can save screenshots and notes for an on-device model to transcribe and summarize.    
 Wrap-up

 
 
  The OnePlus 15R comes in a lovely mint color. 
 
 
  Igor Bonifacic for Engadget
 

In short, the OnePlus 15R is the phone for people who don&#39;t care about photos and videos. That&#39;s the same conclusion I came to with the OP15. If you&#39;re a OnePlus fan, the 15R excels in all the areas you would expect the company&#39;s devices to make a good showing: performance, battery life and display responsiveness. Given I wasn&#39;t too impressed with the OP15&#39;s camera, I would actually recommend the 15R over that model. For $200 off the starting price of the OP15, you&#39;re getting a device that has almost all of the same strengths of its more expensive sibling.  
Compared to other phones in its price range, such as the Pixel 10 and Galaxy S25 FE, the 15R is not as well-rounded, and can&#39;t compete with those devices in camera quality, but you&#39;re getting much better performance, battery life and a display they can&#39;t match.

How a VPN works (and why you should care),"The best VPNs can make your online life more private with software that&#39;s convenient and cheap — sometimes even free. While keeping your IP address invisible, you can use your VPN to explore streaming content from all over the world or (virtually) sneak into a sports event that&#39;s not available in your area.However, while VPNs are widely available, there&#39;s a strange dearth of information on what they actually do behind the scenes. You may know that a VPN masks your device with a proxy server to make it look like you&#39;re somewhere else, and maybe even that encryption is involved. But finding any more details can mean running a gauntlet of misinformation.That&#39;s a shame, because the inner workings of a VPN aren&#39;t all that difficult to understand. You may not be able to build one yourself without a degree in computer science, but with a little work, you can understand exactly what it&#39;s doing on your computer. That&#39;s information you can use to select the right VPN for you, and make the most of it once you&#39;ve got it.What is a VPN?To make sure nobody gets left behind, I&#39;ll start from the beginning. A VPN (virtual private network) is a method of securely accessing a network, either a closed network (like you might have at the office) or the internet as a whole. Initially, organizations set up VPNs so remote workers can work with secure files. While this still happens, the last 15 years have seen VPNs increasingly marketed to individuals, with Proton VPN, ExpressVPN and others seeing massive user growth.Broadly, a VPN consists of two parts: the server, which forwards requests to your chosen destination, and the client, a piece of software that lets you interact with the server. You can find a longer explanation here, but I&#39;ll use the two sections below to tell you what you need to know right now.One more note before that — there are multiple kinds of VPNs, including the remote-access VPNs and site-to-site VPNs commonly used by workplaces. However, for this article, I&#39;ll be talking mainly about the commercial VPN services sold to individuals for general security needs. Instead of a specific network, these VPNs are designed to handle all of a user&#39;s traffic to any point on the internet.What happens when you use a VPN?First, you use the client to connect to a server — either the fastest one available or a particular location you need. Once you&#39;ve connected, every request you send to the internet goes through the VPN server first. This communication between your device and the web is encrypted so it can&#39;t be traced back to you.The VPN server decrypts your requests and sends them on. The destination then communicates with the VPN server, which relays the information back to you — after re-encrypting it so nobody follows it home.Since the VPN does everything on your behalf, it&#39;s your &#34;mask&#34; online. Your internet service provider (ISP) and third parties can see what&#39;s being done, but — so long as you’re not otherwise logged in or identifying yourself — nobody knows that it&#39;s you doing it. It&#39;s like having a friend order pizza for you so the pizzeria doesn&#39;t hear you calling for the third time this week (not that I speak from experience).What&#39;s the point of using a VPN?Why add an extra step to the already complex process of getting online? The two biggest reasons are maintaining anonymity and changing your virtual location. I&#39;ve already explained how a VPN keeps you anonymous. Among other things, this prevents your ISP from selling your browsing history to advertisers and protects activists who face government repercussions for what they do online.Changing your virtual location is part of masking, but it can also be used to see the internet as it&#39;s visible in other countries. Streaming services are frequently limited to certain places, and almost all of them change the available content based on their licenses in each nation. You can also use a VPN in a country with a nationwide firewall, like China, to see forbidden outside information sources.How does a VPN work? The full technical explanationMost online explanations stop after defining a VPN as an anonymous agent between you and the internet — but I wrote this article to go a little bit deeper. To understand what a VPN is doing on a technical level, we&#39;ll need to cover how the internet works, how the VPN knows where to send encrypted information and just what &#34;encryption&#34; actually is.How the internet transmits dataWhen you&#39;re not using a VPN, internet traffic goes directly from your modem to your ISP, then on to your chosen destination. The key technologies here are IP, which stands for Internet Protocol, and TCP, which stands for Transmission Control Protocol. They&#39;re usually combined as TCP/IP.You may have heard that every online device has an IP address that identifies it to every other device. TCP/IP governs not just those names but how data moves between them. Here&#39;s how it works, step-by-step.You click a link or enter a URL into your web browser.Your computer sends a request to your modem, asking to see the page associated with the URL. Your modem forwards the request to your ISP.Your ISP finds a domain name server (DNS) that tells it which IP address is connected to the URL you asked to see. It then sends the request to that IP address along the fastest available route, which will involve being relayed between several nodes.That IP address is connected with a server that holds the content you&#39;re looking for. Once it receives the request, it breaks the data down into small packets of about 1 to 1.5 kilobytes.These packets separate to find their own fastest routes back to your ISP, your modem and finally your web browser, which reassembles them.You see a web page, likely no more than a second after you asked for it.The outgoing requests and inbound packets are key to understanding VPN function. A VPN intervenes during step 2 (when your modem contacts your ISP) and step 5 (when your ISP sends the packets back to you). In the next section, I&#39;ll explain exactly what it does during those steps.How VPN tunneling protects dataYou might have heard a VPN&#39;s activities described as &#34;tunneling.&#34; That term refers to a figurative tunnel being created between your device and the VPN. Data enters the tunnel when it&#39;s encrypted by the VPN client and exits when it&#39;s decrypted by the VPN server. Between those two points, encryption means nobody can see the true data. It&#39;s as though it&#39;s traveling through an opaque tunnel.While the tunnel is a useful metaphor, it may be better to think of VPN encryption as an encapsulation. Each packet of data sent via VPN is &#34;wrapped&#34; in a second packet, which both encrypts the original packet and contains information for reaching the VPN server. However, none of these outer layers have the complete path — each just knows enough to reach the next relay. In this way, the origin point (that&#39;s you) remains invisible.The same thing happens when the internet returns content to show you. Your ISP sends the data to the VPN server, because, as far as it knows, that&#39;s where the request came from. The VPN then encrypts each packet and sends them back to you for decryption and reassembly. It takes a little longer with the extra steps; that&#39;s why VPNs always slightly slow down your browsing speed, though the best ones don&#39;t do that by much (Surfshark is currently the fastest).You learned in that last section that two protocols, IP and TCP (usually combined as TCP/IP), are responsible for letting online devices talk to each other, even if they&#39;ve never connected before. In the same way, a VPN protocol is like a shared language that lets VPNs encrypt, move and decrypt information. See the next section to learn how a VPN protocol works in detail.How VPN protocols encrypt dataVPN protocols are the technology behind VPNs; every other feature of your VPN is just a method of interacting with them. All protocols are designed to encrypt data packets and wrap them in a second layer that includes information on where to send them. The main differences are the shape of that second layer, the types of encryption used and how the client establishes its initial secure connection with the server.It&#39;s extremely common for VPNs to advertise protocols with &#34;bank-grade&#34; or &#34;military-grade&#34; encryption. This is talking about the 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256), a symmetric encryption algorithm, which is used by financial institutions and the US government and military. AES-256 is indeed some of the strongest available encryption, but it&#39;s only part of the story. As a symmetric algorithm, it&#39;s not fully secure on its own, because the same keys are used to encrypt and decrypt it — and those keys can be stolen.For that reason, most VPN protocols use AES-256 (or a similarly strong cipher like ChaCha20) to encrypt the data packets themselves, then combine it with a larger suite of multiple encryption algorithms. One of the most reliable and popular protocols, OpenVPN, uses the asymmetric TLS protocol to establish a secure relationship between client and server, then transmits packets encrypted with AES-256 across that channel, knowing the keys will be safe.Explaining this could easily reach the length of a book, but the basic principle isn&#39;t complicated. In asymmetric encryption, a sender encodes data with a unique key, then a recipient decodes it with a different paired key. The keys are provided by a trusted third party. In a maneuver called a TLS handshake, the server and client send each other encrypted data. If each can decode the other&#39;s test data, they know they have a matched pair of keys, which proves that both are the same client and server that got the keys from the trusted authority.Why not just use asymmetric encryption for the data itself, if it&#39;s more secure? Mainly, protocols don&#39;t do this because it&#39;s a lot slower. Asymmetric encryption requires a lot of resource-heavy math that makes connections drag. That&#39;s why OpenVPN and others use the asymmetric-to-symmetric two-step instead.To summarize, a VPN protocol is a complex set of instructions and tools that control encryption and routing via VPN servers. Protocols still in use include OpenVPN, WireGuard, IKEv2, SSTP and L2TP. PPTP, one of the oldest protocols, is no longer considered secure. On top of these, VPNs often build their own proprietary protocols, such as ExpressVPN&#39;s Lightway.Putting it all togetherNow that we&#39;ve hit all the relevant information, let&#39;s revisit that step-by-step from earlier, this time with a VPN in the mix. Here are the steps, starting with establishing the VPN connection and ending with anonymously viewing a website.You open your VPN client, choose a server location and connect. The VPN client and server authenticate each other with a TLS handshake.The client and server exchange the symmetric keys they&#39;ll use to encrypt and decrypt packets for the duration of this session (i.e. until you disconnect). Your VPN client tells you that it&#39;s established a secure tunnel.You open your web browser and enter a URL. Your browser sends a request to view the content at that address.The request goes to your VPN client, which encrypts it and adds an outer layer of information with directions to the VPN server.The encrypted request reaches the VPN server, which decrypts it and forwards it to your ISP.As normal, your ISP finds the IP address associated with the URL you entered and forwards your request along.The destination server receives the request and sends all the necessary packets of information back to your ISP, which forwards it to the VPN server.The VPN server encrypts each packet and adds a header directing it to the VPN client.The client decrypts the packets and forwards them to your web browser.You see the web page you opened.Because of the encrypted tunnel, the request arrives at the VPN server without any information on where it came from. Thus, the VPN doesn&#39;t actually encrypt your activity on the websites themselves — for the most part, the HTTPS protocol does that. Instead, a VPN gives you a false name to put in the register, with no information that could be traced back to your real identity.How to use this informationNow that you know how a VPN works on a technical level, you&#39;re better equipped to choose one for yourself. You can cut through marketing hype statements like:&#34;Military-grade encryption!&#34; (It&#39;s the same algorithm everybody uses)&#34;Stay completely anonymous online!&#34; (Plaintext you post on social media is not encrypted)&#34;Dodge ISP throttling!&#34; (If your ISP is throttling you based on your IP address, this works — but if you&#39;re being slowed down because of your moment-to-moment activity, your identity doesn&#39;t matter)A VPN is just one important part of a complete cybersecurity breakfast. While hiding your IP address, make sure to also use strong passwords, download updates immediately and remain alert for social engineering tactics.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-a-vpn-works-and-why-you-should-care-143000250.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-05%2Fc357e3b0-34d9-11f0-bbfc-d13d3ba8e49e&resize=1400%2C934&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=b9701df8b5848ad2bbea4e2ebcfa43ec0f549636,https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-a-vpn-works-and-why-you-should-care-143000250.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-17T14:30:00Z,9,Tech
Samsung will show off its expanded Micro RGB TV series at CES,"Last year at CES, Samsung debuted its first mainstream Micro RGB TV, a 115-inch model that surprised us with its rich, vivid colors and $30,000 price tag. Now, the company has announced that it will be showing off an entire lineup of Micro RGB TVs at CES 2026 ranging from 55- to 115-inch models, promising to set &#34;a new standard for premium home viewing.&#34; 
As a reminder, Micro RGB is a unique new technology similar to Mini LED displays. Unlike the white backlights used on Mini LEDs, though, it uses tiny red, green and blue LEDs that produce more accurate colors and offer smaller and more controllable dimming zones. However, because pixels can&#39;t be turned on and off individually like Micro LED or OLED, Micro RGB contrast ratios aren&#39;t as high. They promise to be brighter and more color accurate than other technologies, though, hence the high prices and &#34;premium&#34; branding. 
Samsung&#39;s upcoming Micro RGB lineup will be available in 55-, 65-, 75-, 85-, 100- and 115-inch models and use the next evolution of the company&#39;s technology. The main claim to fame is near broadcast monitor-like color accuracy, covering 100 percent of the demanding BT.2020 HDR standard. That new standard now has a name and VDE certification: Micro RGB Precision Color 100. 
Other key features include Samsung&#39;s &#34;Micro RGB AI Engine Pro&#34; for more precise frame-by-frame clarity and realism, new color enhancement functions, Samsung&#39;s glare free tech and enhanced audio features including Dolby Atmos and Adaptive Sound Pro. 
Yesterday, LG announced that it would also show off new televisions using Micro RGB technology, with 75-, 86- and 100-inch models coming next year. What remains to be seen, however, is pricing. Given the $30,000 cost of the 115-inch model, you can likely expect the first Micro RGB televisions to be among the most expensive in the lineups of both LG and Samsung. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-will-show-off-its-expanded-micro-rgb-tv-series-at-ces-141716449.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2Fb8e7b4d0-db43-11f0-8f3b-8db71cc677ba&resize=1400%2C786&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=966f1ed0c243015fc4d92127d8e5166aea33f153,https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-will-show-off-its-expanded-micro-rgb-tv-series-at-ces-141716449.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-17T14:17:16Z,7,Tech

Big Tech bent the knee for Trump in 2025,"Sure, we&#39;ve seen millions poured into lobbying and other means of influence during every presidency, but the last two years set a whole new bar. Business leaders, including those from almost every Big Tech company, stepped over themselves to prove fealty to Donald Trump&#39;s second administration. It&#39;s easy to see why: Their kowtowing was meant to secure regulatory favors, gain tax and tariff advantages and avoid Trump&#39;s ire. Ultimately, it was all in the service of appeasing their shareholders. Why else would Apple CEO Tim Cook, someone who typically cultivates a progressive image, hand deliver a gold plaque to the President of the United States? Before we leave 2025 behind, it&#39;s worth documenting the many ways tech companies and leaders debased themselves for political favor with the Trump administration. Alphabet (Google)Google dropped diversity recruitment goals in February, following Trump’s executive orders dismantling DEI programs in the federal government. Google also changed its AI principles to allow AI in weapons and surveillance, a move that is in line with the relaxed artificial intelligence regulation the Trump administration would later adopt for its AI Action Plan. To the chagrin of geographers everywhere, the company also replaced the Gulf of Mexico in Google Maps with &#34;Gulf of America,&#34; following Trump&#39;s executive order.Additionally, Alphabet agreed to pay $24.5 million to settle Donald Trump&#39;s lawsuit against YouTube, following the suspension of his YouTube accounts after the January 6th riot. Trump will receive $22 million, while another $2.5 million of the settlement will be paid out to additional plaintiffs who were part of the class action — which is to say, other rioters involved in the storming of the Capitol.Joining plenty of other tech companies, Google donated $1 million to the Trump inauguration, and it’s also contributing to the cost of Trump’s reported $300 million White House ballroom.AmazonIn August, Amazon Web Services said it would provide up to $1 billion in credits to the Trump administration through 2028. Those credits can be put towards AWS cloud services, training and certification and direct contracts.Amazon founder Jeff Bezos also did his fair share to support Trump: He donated $1 million to Trump&#39;s inauguration, and since purchasing the Washington Post in 2013 he pushed the paper to the right. This year, Bezos declared that the Post’s opinion pages would be devoted to the support and defense of “personal liberties” and “free markets.” He added, “We’ll cover other topics too of course, but viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others.&#34; To that end, the Post also hired three new conservative columnists. Bezos reportedly also blocked his paper from endorsing Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.I shared this note with the Washington Post team this morning:I’m writing to let you know about a change coming to our opinion pages.  We are going to be writing every day in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets. We’ll cover other topics too…— Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) February 26, 2025
 

Amazon, too, is contributing to Trump&#39;s $300 million White House ballroom. The Washington Post, unsurprisingly, was one of the first major publications to praise Trump’s ballroom. AppleApple relied on big numbers and flashy trinkets to ingratiate itself to the Trump administration. In February, it said it planned to invest $500 billion into the US economy over the next four years. While that sounds impressive, Apple previously announced another $430 billion multi-year investment for the US in 2021. In a potential bid to avoid the administration’s volatile tariff plans, Apple also said it would invest another $100 billion into the US in August.Tim Cook personally donated $1 million to the Trump inauguration fund, Cook&#39;s first political donation since 2017. At that August event, he also gave Donald Trump a now infamous gold statue for being a special little guy. Additionally, Apple followed in Google’s footsteps by replacing the Gulf of Mexico in Apple Maps with the “Gulf of America.” The company is also chipping in for Trump’s $300 million White House ballroom.MetaMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg wasted no time trying to get into Trump’s good graces, perhaps to erase his previous statement that the President should be “held responsible for his words” for inciting the January 6 Capitol riot. On top of donating $1 million to Trump&#39;s inauguration, Meta announced that it would be getting rid of third-party fact-checkers on Facebook and Instagram on January 7. Instead, it&#39;s relying on community notes similar to X. Meta also ended its DEI initiatives and changed its hate speech rules to allow for calling LGBTQ people “mentally ill.” &#34;We do allow allegations of mental illness or abnormality when based on gender or sexual orientation, given political and religious discourse about transgenderism and homosexuality and common non-serious usage of words such as &#39;weird,&#39;&#34; reads the company’s updated policy.Even Zuckerberg’s charity, which he runs alongside his wife, bowed to Trump. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative ended its diversity programs and stopped providing “social advocacy funding,” which supported immigration and racial equity efforts. According to The Guardian, the charity’s website removed every reference to diversity or promoting scientific research from underrepresented groups.   Similar to Google, Meta said it will pay Donald Trump $25 million to settle his lawsuit related to his Facebook suspension after the January 6 riot. And yes, Meta is also contributing to Trump&#39;s $300 million White House ballroom. MicrosoftMicrosoft contributed $1 million to Trump&#39;s inauguration fund. Previously, it donated $500,000 to Biden&#39;s fund and the same amount for Trump&#39;s first term. It’s also contributing to Trump’s $300 million White House ballroom.Similar to Amazon, Microsoft also offered up to $3.1 billion worth of services to the Trump administration as part of the American-centric “OneGov” strategy. That includes discounts for Microsoft 365, Azure cloud services and cybersecurity tools. Copilot AI will also be discounted to government agencies, and it’ll be completely free for a year for agencies subscribing to Microsoft G5 service.Elon Musk (X, SpaceX, Tesla)Elon Musk was by far the biggest booster for Trump in the business world. He spent a whopping total of $277 million to back Trump and other candidates in 2024, including $239 million to America PAC, his super PAC focused on securing votes for Trump and other Republicans. Musk went so far as to offer $1 million to people who said they would vote for Trump, a move that the Justice Department warned might be illegal. Wisconsin&#39;s Attorney General challenged Musk&#39;s ploy but the state&#39;s Supreme Court declined to hear a case on the matter, thereby giving Musk leeway to award two $1 million checks to voters. Musk&#39;s team edited a video of one of the recipients to remove her admission that she was paid &#34;to vote.&#34; He also joked that he could be jailed if Kamala Harris won the 2024 election, which could be referencing potential election fraud, his penchant for busting unions, national security concerns from his uncomfortably close relationship with Vladimir Putin or any number of potential crimes.Elon Musk spearheaded DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency), an unelected position from which he was given nearly unprecedented federal oversight. Once installed he hired his techie acolytes to chip away at government budgets and staffs. For the first few weeks of the second Trump administration, it appeared as if Musk had unfettered power to manipulate the government.And let&#39;s not forget, while leading DOGE, the world&#39;s richest man also destroyed USAID, the world&#39;s largest food aid provider, for no apparent reason other than cruelty. After purchasing Twitter in 2022 and renaming it &#34;X,&#34; Musk has also transformed Twitter into a Trump-friendly social network focused on “free speech.” He reinstated Trump’s Twitter account, which was banned after the January 6 Capitol riot, and he also paid Trump around $10 million to settle his lawsuit over being kicked off the platform. X is now a platform that amplifies far-right extremists, treats the inclusive term “cisgender” as a slur and doesn’t punish users for deadnaming and misgendering trans people.What about the rest?This is by no means an exhaustive documenting of every single tech tycoon that has bent the knee. NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang, for instance, told Joe Rogan in an interview that “everything that [Trump] thinks through is very practical and very common sense, and, you know, it&#39;s very logical.” According to Axios, Huang added that Trump &#34;wants to make sure that that the important, critical technology of our nation is built in United States, and that we re-industrialize and get good at manufacturing again, because it&#39;s important for jobs.&#34; It’s also worth remembering that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Oracle chairman Larry Ellison joined President Trump onstage in announcing Stargate — “the largest AI infrastructure project by far in history.” The two were joined by Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son, who called the moment the “beginning of a golden age.” The next day, Altman posted on X that he believed Trump “will be incredible for the country in many ways!”Ellison’s son David is the CEO of Skydance, and has infamously been rebuilding Paramount with Bari Weiss since the merger of Paramount Global and Skydance Media was approved this year. The list of major tech players bowing to Trump only grows from here, and putting the bulk of the transactions in one place should serve to remind us how closely tied Big Tech is with American (and global) politics.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/general/big-tech-bent-the-knee-for-trump-in-2025-140000365.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2Fba8f1830-da0f-11f0-bdf9-4e9dd760f643&resize=1400%2C935&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=ee9f6e847e151049115ebe9efaea46e9452493ae,https://www.engadget.com/general/big-tech-bent-the-knee-for-trump-in-2025-140000365.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-17T14:00:00Z,19,Tech

Warner Bros. Discovery rejects Paramount's hostile bid,"Warner Bros. Discovery&#39;s board has formally rejected the $108 billion takeover bid from Paramount Skydance, the company announced. WBD said it remains committed to its $82.7 billion deal with Netflix, which would close some time next year, pending regulatory approval. 
&#34;[The board] has unanimously determined that the tender offer launched by Paramount Skydance on December 8, 2025 is not in the best interests of WBD and its shareholders and does not meet the criteria of a &#34;Superior Proposal&#34; under the terms of WBD&#39;s merger agreement with Netflix announced on December 5, 2025,&#34; the studio said in the press release. 
Paramount&#39;s offer was funded in part by sovereign wealth funds from Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Abu Dhabi, so it could have triggered a national security review by the US government. However, Paramount said that even if those entities dropped out, the company&#39;s owners (the Ellisons) would &#34;backstop the full amount of the bid.&#34;
However, the board said that Paramount &#34;has consistently misled WBD shareholders that its proposed transaction has a &#39;full backstop&#39; from the Ellison family. It does not, and never has,&#34; adding that &#34;the terms of the Netflix merger are superior.&#34; WBD explained that Paramount is relying on an &#34;opaque revocable trust&#34; for said backstop which is &#34;no replacement for a secured commitment by a controlling shareholder.&#34; WBD&#39;s board also noted that Paramount expects to achieve $9 billion in cost synergies from the merger, and that &#34;would make Hollywood weaker, not stronger.&#34; 
In a statement, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said that &#34;the Warner Bros. Discovery board reinforced that Netflix&#39;s merger agreement is superior and that our acquisition is in the best interest of stockholders. This was a competitive process that delivered the best outcome for consumers, creators, stockholders and the broader entertainment industry.&#34;
Paramount has yet to comment, but the company has previously said that its $30 per share offer is a better deal, due to the all-cash nature (compared to 84 percent cash for Netflix) and fact that it would have a clearer path to regulatory approval due to the Ellison&#39;s supposedly tight relationship with President Trump. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/warner-bros-discovery-rejects-paramounts-hostile-bid-131055882.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2Fbbfffbe0-db44-11f0-aefe-d354d1d6386d&resize=1400%2C783&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=f5fcb045a564c3dbe59f20fccec65be7db08aa9a,https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/warner-bros-discovery-rejects-paramounts-hostile-bid-131055882.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-17T13:10:55Z,11,Tech
"The best subscription gifts to send to your loved ones this Christmas: Disney+ bundle, MasterClass, Field Notes and more","There are way too many online services and subscriptions to keep track of these days, but the flip side is there’s a tool for just about everything. Time is just about up to get a physical gift shipped in time for the holidays, so below we’ve pulled together some of our favorite digital gifts and subscriptions, including time-tested video, music and gaming services as well as tools to clear your mental space and learn new skills. There are also a few subscriptions that provide ongoing, IRL deliveries, if you think your giftee will appreciate the nostalgic charm of a physical object. 
Best digital gifts and subscription gifts 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  
Gaming subscriptions 
Game consoles are certainly among the most popular gift ideas this time of year. If you know someone who’s been so good that they’re getting a new Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X/S, one of these subscriptions will make their shiny toy immediately playable out of the box. 

  
There’s no doubt that Microsoft has changed the value proposition for its Game Pass subscription service service. It recently raised the price for its most comprehensive Ultimate tier by 50 percent, to $30 a month. That’s a bitter pill to swallow — but devoted players who have an Xbox as their main (or only) console will still get a ton of value out of Game Pass. 
The aforementioned Ultimate tier provides access to more than 500 games that’ll work on Xbox, PC and other supported devices. It’s also the only way to get “day one” release games like Hollow Knight: Silksong Ninja Gaiden 4, The Outer World 2, Call of Duty Black Ops 7; in recent years other high-profile day one releases have included Doom: The Dark Ages, Starfield, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Forza Motorsport and numerous others. Game Pass Ultimate subscribers also have access to the highest quality and fastest game streaming Xbox offers. For a slightly less hardcore Xbox fan, though, the $15-per-month Premium tier is also worth considering. 

  
Nintendo’s Switch Online subscription has gotten some nice upgrades in 2025, the year of the Switch 2. As it has for years, Nintendo offers two different Switch Online plans. The basic $20-per-year plan unlocks online play and enables Switch 2 owners to use the system&#39;s GameChat capabilities. It also includes more than 100 Game Boy, NES and Super NES games, cloud backups of your saved games as well as the occasional special offers. It also includes access to the rather silly but enjoyable Nintendo Music app, so you can listen to your favorite Zelda or Mario tracks at any time. 
The $50 “expansion pack” adds a collection of N64, Game Boy Advance and Sega Genesis games as well as some DLC for games like Mario Kart 8, Animal Crossing: New Horizons and Splatoon 2. But most interesting are the new additions for Switch 2 owners: there’s a small but growing library of GameCube games, including classics like The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker and F-Zero GX. Switch 2 owners who have the expansion pack subscription can also upgrade to the Switch 2 versions of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom for free. 

  
A PlayStation Plus subscription is a must-have for any PS5 owners. That’s partially because you need one to play multiplayer games online, but there are plenty of other significant benefits. PS Plus comes in three tiers, but the middle “Extra” plan ($15/month or $135/year) is probably best for most gamers. In addition to cloud storage for saves, online multiplayer support and a couple of free games for your library every month, you get access to the PlayStation Plus catalog, which includes more than 400 PS4 and PS5 games. 
There are a number of heavy hitters here, including The Last of Us Part I and II, Ghost of Tsushima, God of War Ragnarok, Death Stranding, Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered and Returnal alongside lower-profile hits and indie games such as Citizen Sleeper, Sayonara Wild Hearts, Dave the Diver and Humanity. If you know someone who loves older games though, the “Premium” tier ($18/month or $160/year) adds a bunch of titles from the PS1 through the PS4 as well as perks like game trials and PS5 game streaming from the cloud.

Alexa Home Theater: Everything you need to know about Amazon's newest Echo feature,"When Amazon’s latest Echo speakers arrived in October, a feature the company spent time hyping during its fall devices event was missing. Alexa Home Theater arrived in late November, allowing owners of a recent Fire TV device and either of the new Echo speakers the ability to use up to five units and an Echo Sub as a surround sound setup. The main selling point is that the underlying tech allows you to put the speakers wherever you want and Alexa Home Theater will handle the rest. A robust array of speakers is a considerable investment, though, and there are limitations to Amazon’s latest play for your living room.What is Alexa Home Theater?At the most basic level, Alexa Home Theater is an automatic room calibration tool that’s akin to Trueplay from Sonos, SpaceFit Sound from Samsung or Sound Field Optimization from Sony. The feature, no matter which company builds it, is designed to automatically tune the acoustics of a soundbar or other speakers to the acoustics of the room. These tools allow companies to account for things like high ceilings and weird angles, adjusting audio performance so things sound their best no matter how your home is designed. Like similar technologies from other companies, Alexa Home Theater and the latest Echo speakers also support spatial awareness. This allows you to position the speakers however they best fit in your living room and the underlying tech will balance the sound based on their proximity to each other. Gone are the days when you have to put rear speakers in a specific spot in order for them to work. For the latest Echo speakers, Amazon overhauled Alexa Home Theater to accommodate more devices in a single setup. Now you can use up to five Echo Dot Max or second-generation Echo Studio units and a subwoofer at the same time. Of course, this means you can put the compact speakers around the perimeter of your home theater space, providing more immersive surround sound than a single speaker or two can muster. Alexa Home Theater recognizes each Echo speaker and adjusts the system accordingly. What hardware do I need to use it?My test setup was four Echo Studio speakers and a Fire TV Stick 4K Max.Billy Steele for EngadgetIf you want to use more than two Echo speakers and a subwoofer in your Alexa Home Theater setup, you’ll need the latest Amazon devices to make that happen. That list includes the Echo Dot Max and second-gen Echo Studio, along with the Echo Sub if you crave more bass. You’ll also need a Fire TV streaming gadget for the multi-speaker option, but it has to be one of the following:Fire TV Cube (3rd gen)Fire TV Stick 4K Max (2nd gen) Fire TV Stick 4K (2nd gen)Fire TV Stick 4K PlusYou might be wondering why Alexa Home Theater isn’t supported on other (older) Amazon streaming and audio models. Well, it is… but you’ll only be allowed to pair just two Echo speakers of the same model with an optional subwoofer for a total of three devices. That list of supported models is quite long, but it accounts for the two most recent generations of both the Echo and Echo Dot in addition to the Echo Pop, Echo Plus (2nd gen) and the original Echo Studio. This two-speaker method is also supported on more Fire TV devices, including some standalone TVs with Amazon’s streaming platform built in. In that scenario, it means you could pair two Echo speakers with a subwoofer, for example, and have them play the same audio content with Alexa Home Theater.Currently, Amazon says these are Fire TV devices that don’t support Alexa Home Theater: Fire TV Stick 4K SelectAmazon Fire TV 2-SeriesFire TV 4-Series (2025 Release, newest model)Fire TV Omni QLED Series (2025 Release, newest model)Fire TV Omni Mini-LED Series (2024 Release, newest model)How to set up Alexa Home TheaterLike nearly all home theater speakers and soundbars these days, setting up Alexa Home Theater is easy once you have the required hardware in place. Unlike a lot of the competition, this initial configuration isn’t done in a mobile app — it’s handled by the Settings menu on a compatible Fire TV device. Before you initiate the setup process, you’ll want to make sure your Echo speakers and Fire TV device are up to date. You can ask Alexa to check for updates to the speakers, while you’ll need to check the Device &amp; Software section of the Fire TV Settings menu for those gadgets. Once everything is current, here are the steps to follow to get started with Alexa Home Theater: Go to Settings on your Fire TV.Select Display &amp; Sounds. Select Alexa Home Theater.Select Create Alexa Home Theater. Select the compatible Echo speakers. You can also add an Echo Sub during this step. Follow the on-screen instructions to configure the system. After you select either the second-gen Echo Studio or the Echo Dot Max, hit Next and the system will calibrate automatically. If you select other Echo speakers, hit Next and then confirm the placement of the speakers before calibration. When the setup is complete, the Alexa Home Theater system is ready to use. To do so, select either Home or Watch Preview. Using Alexa Home Theater with four Echo Studio speakersThe two Echo Studio speakers that flanked my TV primarily handled dialogue.Billy Steele for EngadgetLike most home theater gear, the Fire TV will play short audio clips through each Echo speaker and your TV speakers to determine their location and to calibrate the group to the room. From start to finish, the setup process takes about five minutes — so long as your Fire TV and all speakers are running up-to-date firmware. It’s a quick and straightforward process, which meant I was watching Fallout soon after putting all of the speakers in place. While streaming that video game-inspired original series, the Echo Studios provided an immersive audio experience with directional sound and crisp, clear dialogue. The front two speakers handle speech, but there’s some nuance in what direction it’s coming from on screen. Rear speakers are tasked with the bulk of the environmental noise, whether that’s nearby water, passing cars, rain or gunfire — just to name a few. I was also pleasantly surprised by how much bassy rumble these speakers produced during movies and shows. I didn’t think a single unit was particularly adept at low-end tone during my review, but I think it would be just fine to use a collection of Echo Studios without having to add the Echo Sub. The overall audio performance here is certainly a boost over any TV’s built-in speakers, but the sense of immersion isn’t as complete as what a soundbar and a pair of rear satellite speakers can provide. Specifically, I felt like the foursome of Echo Studio speakers in my test setup stumbled with the height channels. Despite the angled design of the devices and their multi-driver configurations, the effect of overhead and aerial sounds was quite subdued. And the worst part about this is that there’s no way to try to fix it with settings. That’s because there are minimal settings to adjust once Alexa Home Theater is set up. There are two features — dialogue boost and volume leveler — but those are both Fire TV settings rather than items meant for any connected speakers. In the Alexa Home Theater menu, there’s a lip sync tool to address any audio lag, which is a standard item for any soundbar. I would’ve loved to see some kind of channel adjustment at the very least, so that I could dial in the mix a bit rather than relying on Amazon’s preferences. If you turn to Alexa for help, the assistant can only change bass, treble and midrange, and it can only do so when prompted by voice commands. When I asked for it to turn up the dialogue, it seemed to just increase the volume. If I asked it to adjust the height channels, Alexa responded affirmatively, but it didn’t sound like any tweaks were applied. Amazon later confirmed that those basic EQ changes are Alexa and actually do here. Another gripe I have with Alexa Home Theater is the inability to connect my phone or another device to the entire group for music. You can still sync with individual Echo Studio speakers for music via Bluetooth, but if you want to use the whole shebang, you’ll have to play your tunes from the Fire TV or ask Alexa to help. The Fire TV platform has plenty of audio streaming apps, but Apple Music isn’t there and that’s where my monthly subscription resides. You have to add the Apple Music skill to the Alexa app on your phone first, then you can stream content from the service by asking Amazon’s assistant. For other services with Fire TV apps, you’re using your TV to play music, and most of the time I want the TV off and to just pick up my phone to blast some Spiritbox. I also like to control the queue from my phone, but alas that’s not an option here. Wrap-upAmazon&#39;s new Echo Studio is a complete redesign from the 2019 model.Billy Steele for EngadgetThe main issue with using four Echo Studios and a Fire TV is the cost. For the speakers alone, you’re looking at nearly $900 for the setup I tested. When the new Echo speakers were announced in September, Amazon said it would offer Alexa Home Theater bundles with multiple speakers, but I couldn’t find those on the company’s website. For comparison, Sonos currently offers multiple configurations of the Beam soundbar and either Era 100 speakers or a sub for less than $800. For the same price as four Echo Studio speakers, you can get Sony’s Bravia Theater System 6, which comes with a soundbar, rear speakers and a subwoofer. There are other options from other companies as well in the $800 range, and most people will likely be happier with a dedicated soundbar-based setup than four Echo units and a subwoofer. Hello, AirPlay and Google Cast.From an aesthetic perspective, I can see why someone might opt for multiple Echo speakers instead of a mid-sized (or larger) soundbar. Two Echo Studios on either side of my TV with the two rear units tucked away on a shelf certainly creates a clean look. And in terms of sound, using two Echo Studio speakers, let alone four like I tested, will provide a noticeable boost over a TV’s built-in speakers. However, the lack of customization and the inability to control music from my phone for an Alexa Home Theater group makes it hard to recommend Amazon’s latest for shoppers looking for more immersive audio in the living room. Hopefully the company will continue to refine this feature so that it’s more capable in the future.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/alexa-home-theater-everything-you-need-to-know-about-amazons-newest-echo-feature-130000328.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2FIMG_7660.jpg&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=feded6e77320689521dc7892a1dbab39f98ce235,https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/alexa-home-theater-everything-you-need-to-know-about-amazons-newest-echo-feature-130000328.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-17T13:00:00Z,11,Tech

JumpCloud agent turns uninstall into a system shortcut,"
		
					  
						




JumpCloud’s Remote Assist for Windows agent contained a critical local privilege escalation flaw, allowing full system compromise.



Disclosed by XM Cyber, the vulnerability stems from insecure file operations during uninstall or update flows that execute with Windows NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM privileges. The bug could allow a low-privileged local user to elevate themselves to full system control or induce denial-of-service conditions on corporate machines.



JumpCloud’s agent is widely used in enterprise environments as part of its cloud-based Directory-as-a-service platform, managing device access and remote support features across Windows endpoints. According to XM Cyber’s Hillel Pinto, attackers only need a local foothold to exploit the flaw, generally obtainable from phishing, remote support sessions, or developer machines.



Systems running Remote Assist for Windows before version 0.317 are vulnerable and need to be updated immediately to mitigate risks.



Privileged uninstall in a untrusted temp space



The flaw, tracked as CVE-2025-34352 and rated at CVSS 8.5 out of 10, highlights risks from improper handling of privileged operations on Windows endpoints. During uninstall or update operations, the JumpCloud agent triggers the Remote Assist uninstaller with system-level privileges, the highest possible authority in Windows.



However, that routine performs create, write, execute, and delete actions on files in a user-writable %TEMP% subdirectory without validating the trustworthiness of the path or resetting access control lists.



Because the uninstaller performs privileged file operations inside a user-controlled %TEMP% directory, a low-privileged attacker can abuse those operations to overwrite or delete protected system files.



“What we have is a JumpCloud process with NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM privileges that is deleting, writing, and executing a file with a predictable filename from an untrusted path,” Pinto said in a blog post. “The core of the exploit involves Link Following, utilizing mount points and symbolic links to redirect the privileged I/O operation.”



Full privilege escalation and denial of service



The vulnerability opens two primary exploitation vectors with significant operational impact: full privilege escalation to system level, and denial of service (DoS).



By manipulating filesystem paths and leveraging race conditions, an attacker can redirect the uninstaller’s operations to delete or overwrite protected installer configuration targets, ultimately triggering techniques that give them a system-level command prompt. System access on an enterprise endpoint effectively grants control over policy enforcement, credential theft paths, and lateral movement capabilities.



Alternatively, attackers can get the privileged process to write arbitrary data to sensitive system files (such as drivers), corrupting them and forcing blue screen of death (BSOD) conditions. This not only knocks machines offline but can require substantial remediation effort, particularly across distributed fleets.



Pinto said that updating to JumpCloud Remote Assist for Windows version 0.317.0 or later will remediate this issue. “My team and I responsibly disclosed the vulnerability to JumpCloud, which confirmed the findings and promptly released a patch.” While &gt;NIST’s National Vulnerability Database (NVD) marks the flaw as fixed and references the JumpCloud Agent release notes for patching, there is currently no note dedicated to the flaw on the page or on JumpCloud’s support site. JumpCloud did not immediately respond to CSO’s request for comments.

Amazon in talks to invest $10 billion in OpenAI and supply its Trainium chips,"Amazon is in discussions with OpenAI to invest $10 billion in the company while supplying more of its AI chips and cloud computing services, according to The Financial Times. The deal would push OpenAI&#39;s valuation over $500 billion but is likely to raise more questions about the company&#39;s circular investment agreements involving chips and data centers. 
The two companies are also in talks about the possibility of OpenAI helping Amazon with its online marketplace, similar to deals it has made with Etsy, Shopify and Instacart. However, any agreement still wouldn&#39;t allow Amazon to market OpenAI&#39;s most advanced models on its developer cloud platform, as Microsoft holds the exclusive rights to those until the 2030s. 
OpenAI recently restructured its agreement with Microsoft to allow it to use data center capacity from other suppliers. Around the same time, it made a string of deals with NVIDIA, Oracle, AMD and others to build out data center capacity and acquire or rent AI chips. 
The new deal would require OpenAI to use Amazon&#39;s Trainium AI chips and rent more data center capacity from Amazon Web Services (AWS). That&#39;s on top of the $38 billion that OpenAI has already committed to renting servers from AWS over the next seven years. 
These deals have sounded alarms among investors considering their circular nature. In many of those, including this latest Amazon deal, OpenAI is taking investment money and then sending that cash back to the same company for infrastructure or chips. And the amounts are staggering, with just two companies, Softbank and Oracle, spending a combined $400 billion on new data centers for OpenAI&#39;s compute needs. And so far, OpenAI has lost more money than it makes. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/amazon-in-talks-to-invest-10-billion-in-openai-and-supply-its-trainium-chips-103653151.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F23c8ce30-db29-11f0-9aff-051252a3d2c5&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=5294010248d8161f4b8ffb445082e3602827ebd6,https://www.engadget.com/ai/amazon-in-talks-to-invest-10-billion-in-openai-and-supply-its-trainium-chips-103653151.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-17T10:36:53Z,10,Tech

Best Chromebooks FAQs 
What is Chrome OS, and why would I use it over Windows? 
This is probably the number one question about Chromebooks. There are plenty of inexpensive Windows laptops on the market, so why bother with Chrome&#39;s operating system? Glad you asked. For me, the simple and clean nature of Chrome OS is a big selling point. Chrome OS is based on Google’s Chrome browser, which means most of the programs you can run are web based. There’s no bloatware or unwanted apps to uninstall like you often get on Windows laptops, it boots up in seconds, and you can completely reset to factory settings almost as quickly. 
Of course, simplicity will also be a major drawback for some users. Not being able to install native software can be a dealbreaker if you’re a video editor or software developer. But there are also plenty of people who do the majority of their work in a web browser, using tools like Google Docs and spreadsheets for productivity without needing a full Windows setup. 
Google and its software partners are getting better every year at supporting more advanced features. For example, Google added video editing tools to the Google Photos app on Chromebooks – it won’t replace Adobe Premiere, but it should be handy for a lot of people. Similarly, Google and Adobe announced Photoshop on the web in 2023, something that brings much of the power of Adobe’s desktop apps to Chromebooks. 
Chromebooks can also run Android apps, which greatly expands the amount of software available. The quality varies widely, but it means you can do more with a Chromebook beyond just web-based apps. For example, you can install the Netflix app and save videos for offline watching. Other Android apps like Microsoft Office and Adobe Lightroom are surprisingly capable as well. Between Android apps and a general improvement in web apps, Chromebooks are more than just portals to a browser. 
What do Chromebooks do well? 

 
 
 
Put simply, web browsing and really anything web based. Online shopping, streaming music and video and using various social media sites are among the most common daily tasks people do on Chromebooks. As you might expect, they also work well with Google services like Photos, Docs, Gmail, Drive, Keep and so on. Yes, any computer that can run Chrome can do that too, but the lightweight nature of Google Chrome OS makes it a responsive and stable platform. 
As I mentioned before, Chrome OS can run Android apps, so if you’re an Android user you’ll find some nice ties between the platforms. You can get most of the same apps that are on your phone on a Chromebook and keep info in sync between them. You can also use some Android phones as a security key for your Chromebook or instantly tether your 2-in-1 laptop to use mobile data. 
Google continues to tout security as a major differentiator for Chromebooks, and it’s definitely a factor worth considering. Auto-updates are the first lines of defense: Chrome OS updates download quickly in the background and a fast reboot is all it takes to install the latest version. Google says that each webpage and app on a Chromebook runs in its own sandbox as well, so any security threats are contained to that individual app. Finally, Chrome OS has a self-check called Verified Boot that runs every time a device starts up. Beyond all this, the simple fact that you generally can’t install traditional apps on a Chromebook means there are fewer ways for bad actors to access the system. 
If you’re interested in Google’s Gemini AI tools, a Chromebook is a good option as well. Every Chromebook in our top picks comes with a full year of Google’s AI Pro plan — this combines the usual Google One perks like 2TB of storage and 10 percent back in purchases from the Google Store with a bunch of AI tools. You’ll get access to Gemini in Chrome, Gmail, Google Docs and other apps, Gemini 2.5 Pro in the Gemini app and more. Given that this plan is $20/month, it’s a pretty solid perk. Chromebook Plus models also include tools like the AI-powered “help me write,” the Google Photos Magic Editor and generative AI backgrounds you can create by filling in a few prompts. 
As for when to avoid Chromebooks, the answer is simple: If you rely heavily on a specific native application for Windows or a Mac, chances are you won’t find the exact same option on a ChromeOS device. That’s most true in fields like photo and video editing, but it can also be the case in law or finance. Plenty of businesses run on Google’s G suite software, but more still have specific requirements that a Chromebook might not match. If you’re an iPhone user, you’ll also miss out on the way the iPhone easily integrates with an iPad or Mac. For me, the big downside is not being able to access iMessage on a Chromebook. 
Finally, gaming Chromebooks are not ubiquitous, although they’re becoming a slightly more reasonable option with the rise of cloud gaming. In late 2022, Google and some hardware partners announced a push to make Chromebooks with cloud gaming in mind. From a hardware perspective, that means laptops with bigger screens that have higher refresh rates as well as optimizing those laptops to work with services like NVIDIA GeForce Now, Xbox Game Pass and Amazon Luna. You’ll obviously need an internet connection to use these services, but the good news is that playing modern games on a Chromebook isn’t impossible. You can also install Android games from the Google Play Store, but that’s not what most people are thinking of when they want to game on a laptop. 
What are the most important specs for a Chromebook? 

 
 
 
Chrome OS is lightweight and runs well on fairly modest hardware, so the most important thing to look for might not be processor power or storage space. But Google made it easier to get consistent specs and performance late last year when it introduced the Chromebook Plus initiative. Any device with a Chromebook Plus designation meets some minimum requirements, which happen to be very similar to what I’d recommend most people get if they’re looking for the best laptop they can use every day. 
Chromebook Plus models have at least a 12th-gen Intel Core i3 processor, or an AMD Ryzen 3 7000 series processor, both of which should be more than enough for most people. These laptops also have a minimum of 8GB of RAM and 128GB of SSD storage, which should do the trick unless you’re really pushing your Chromebook. All Chromebook Plus models have to have a 1080p webcam, which is nice in these days of constant video calling, and they also all have to have at least a 1080p FHD IPS screen. 
Of course, you can get higher specs or better screens if you desire, but I’ve found that basically everything included in the Chromebook Plus target specs makes for a very good experience. 
Google has an Auto Update policy for Chromebooks as well, and while that’s not exactly a spec, it’s worth checking before you buy. Last year, Google announced that Chromebooks would get software updates and support for an impressive 10 years after their release date. This support page lists the Auto Update expiration date for virtually every Chromebook ever, but a good rule of thumb is to buy the newest machine you can to maximize your support. 
How much should I spend on a Chromebook? 
Chromebooks started out notoriously cheap, with list prices often coming in under $300. But as they’ve gone more mainstream, they’ve transitioned from being essentially modern netbooks to some of the best laptops you’ll want to use all day. As such, prices have increased: At this point, you should expect to spend at least $400 if you want a solid daily driver. There are still many Chromebooks out there available at a low price that may be suitable as secondary devices, but a good Chromebook that can be an all-day, every-day laptop will cost more. But, notably, even the best Chromebooks usually cost less than the best Windows laptops, or even the best “regular” laptops out there. 
There are a handful of premium Chromebooks that approach or even exceed $1,000 that claim to offer better performance and more processing power, but I don’t recommend spending that much. Generally, that’ll get you a better design with more premium materials, as well as more powerful internals and extra storage space, like a higher-capacity SSD. Of course, you also sometimes pay for the brand name. But, the specs I outlined earlier are usually enough, and there are multiple good premium Chromebooks in the $700 to $800 range at this point.

Other Chromebooks we tested 
Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5i Chromebook Plus 
This was our pick for best overall Chromebook for years, and it’s still one of the better options you can find for a basic laptop that doesn’t break the bank. It’s a few years older than our current top pick, so its processor isn’t fresh and it only has 128GB of storage. It also won’t get updates from Google as long as newer models. But it still combines a nice screen and keyboard with solid performance. This laptop typically costs $500, which feels high given its a few years old and Acer’s Chromebook Plus 514 is only $350, but if you can find it on sale and can’t find the Acer it’s worth a look. 
ASUS CX15 
This Chromebook is extremely affordable – you can currently pick it up for only $159 at Walmart. That price and its large 15.6-inch screen is mainly what it has going for it, as the Intel Celeron N4500 chip and 4GB of RAM powering it does not provide good performance if you’re doing anything more than browsing with a few tabs open. If you’re shopping for someone with extremely basic needs and have a small budget, the CX15 might fit the bill. But just be aware that you get what you pay for. 
Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus 
Samsung’s Galaxy Chromebook Plus, released in late 2024, is one of the more unique Chromebooks out there. It’s extremely thin and light, at 0.46 inches and 2.6 pounds, but it manages to include a 15.6-inch display in that frame. That screen is a 1080p panel that’s sharp and bright, but its 16:9 aspect ratio made things feel a bit cramped when scrolling vertically. Performance is very good, and the keyboard is solid, though I’m not a fan of the number pad as it shifts everything to the left. At $700 it’s not cheap, but that feels fair considering its size and capabilities. If you’re looking for a big screen laptop that is also super light, this Chromebook merits consideration, even if it’s not the best option for everyone.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-chromebooks-160054646.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F52549d60-d44e-11f0-bea9-c610753e87f2&resize=1400%2C840&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=8bc86c9a7aea09fe737a1ba67d195b17469f5669,https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-chromebooks-160054646.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-17T10:01:26Z,13,Tech

CASB buyer’s guide: What to know about cloud access security brokers before you buy,"
		
					  
						




Cloud access security brokers (CASBs) explained



As the name suggests, a cloud access security broker (CASB) manages access between enterprise endpoints and cloud resources from a security perspective. CASBs can be deployed on-premises or in the cloud; as a hardware appliance or software-only, as a proxy, reverse proxy, or through specific APIs.



Enterprises have untold numbers of endpoints, both managed (corporate-owned devices) and unmanaged (devices owned by employees or third-party contractors). Endpoints can be on-premises or remote. And endpoints can include internet of things (IoT) devices.

What to ask before cloud access security broker (CASB) tool



Essential reading




In a multicloud environment, each endpoint could connect to multiple cloud resources over the course of a single day — productivity apps (like Microsoft 365), SaaS apps (like Salesforce and Workday), collaboration apps (like Slack and Zoom), and cloud storage (like Amazon Web Services and Dropbox). Not to mention homegrown apps that have been migrated to the cloud, or apps that have been developed in the cloud (that is, cloud-native).



CASBs sit between an organization’s endpoints and cloud resources, acting as a gateway that monitors everything that goes in or out, providing visibility into what users are doing in the cloud, enforcing access control policies, and looking out for security threats.



Some vendors have begun incorporating additional features into core CASB functionality, such as data loss prevention (DLP), secure web gateway (SWG), cloud security posture management (CSPM), and user and entity behavior analytics (UEBA).



However, it is important to note that CASBs are also a key component of a broader security strategy that goes by several names:




Gartner calls that broader strategy Secure Service Edge (SSE), an integration of CASB, secure web gateway (SWG), and zero trust network access (ZTNA). According to Gartner, by 2026, 85% of organizations seeking to secure their web, SaaS, and private applications will obtain the security capabilities from a Security Service Edge (SSE) offering. The Gartner nomenclature has become the de facto standard. They and others have used a second acronym, Security Access Service Edge (SASE).



IDC defines the category as network edge security as a service (NESaaS), with the same three core components: CASB, SWG, and ZTNA. “The network security market is in the process of a much-needed convergence trend. Security vendors have shifted from a focus on à la carte, individualized security services to a consolidated, cloud-delivered network security platform that treats individual services as optional modules,” IDC states.




Why enterprises need cloud access security brokers (CASBs)



The original use case for CASBs was to address shadow IT. When security execs deployed their first CASB tools, they were surprised to discover how many employees had their own personal cloud storage accounts, where they squirreled away corporate data. CASB tools can help security teams discover and monitor unauthorized or unmanaged cloud services being used by employees. This has grown to also include shadow AI services, as more enterprise users pick various machine learning models and use personal accounts to access public-facing generative AI tools.



Today, CASBs encompass a variety of other use cases:




Data protection: The COVID-19 pandemic drove employees to remote work and applications to the cloud, where they could be more easily accessed. The pandemic has passed, and many employees have returned to the office, but those applications and that data are still in the cloud. Organizations must protect sensitive data as it moves across a hybrid cloud environment. Today’s CASB often integrates DLP functionality.



Compliance: Data privacy regulations continue to tighten. CASBs are an important tool in an organization’s overall regulatory compliance framework, enforcing data privacy policies.



Remote workforce: Regardless of the location of employees, CASBs allow enterprises to implement more consistent security standards and secure remote access to cloud resources.



Threat detection: CASBs can detect malicious activity, intrusion attempts, ransomware, and other types of security events. CASB tools can generate real-time alerts to enable quick response by security teams and feed these alerts into other security platforms to mitigate and resolve them.




What to look for in a cloud access security brokers (CASB) tool



From a purely functional perspective, there are four key features of a CASB tool:




Visibility: CASBs provide comprehensive visibility into cloud usage, user activities, and data flows.



Control: CASBs offer granular control over user permissions and data access.



Data protection: CASB solutions provide data protection capabilities to safeguard sensitive information across multiple cloud services.



Compliance: CASB tools help maintain compliance with data privacy regulations.




Beyond those core features, organizations need to make sure the CASB tool well integrates with existing cloud services, applications, and security infrastructure.



There are three deployment modes: forward proxy, reverse proxy and API-based. Most experts say that API-based CASBs provide better functionality, but organizations need to make sure that the vendor’s list of application programming interface (API) connections matches up with the organization’s inventory of cloud apps.



Core CASB services



Take note about the use or requirements for deploying various agents with each product. This is where the CASB vendors often place their secret sauce, which could be an issue depending on how agent-friendly or agent-adverse your IT department is. For example, Skyhigh uses a single agent that functions across all three operational modes. Some of the other CASBs have multiple agents — such as for specific functional areas like antivirus, DLP, or VPN — that can get messy, not to mention tough to deal with unmanaged endpoints such as personal mobile phones and embedded devices such as internet of things controllers.



The following three basic services that all CASBs offer are at the core of what CASBs do and why you would buy one:



Monitor and control your most sensitive data flows: CASBs were originally designed to stem the tide of shadow IT products and to control and make SaaS applications more secure. Now they have broadened their use and can fit into a variety of situations, including operating across multiple cloud providers and mixing SaaS, mobile, and on-premises applications, too.



Apply uniform DLP policies across all servers and apps: As your data appetite increases, you need better ways to ensure that you aren’t leaking customer- and business-sensitive information, either through a malicious insider or inadvertently through a bad combination of security loopholes. While DLP products have been around for years, having DLP-like features in your CASB can be a nice way to track these potential weak spots, especially as more of your data moves into the cloud and is accessed by unmanaged mobile devices.



Manage cloud-native encryption keys: Ideally, your CASB should automatically keep track of your encryption needs and keys so you don’t have to do this manually, and so you can encrypt more of your data.



Some CASB tools are better at some things than others. For example:




Bitglass has an Ajax virtual machine-like layer that handles near-real-time DLP on unmanaged devices. The only caveat is that these devices have to access data through their browsers.



Some CASBs, such as Fortra, has field-level encryption on some SaaS structured data services, which can be a handy mechanism for protecting sensitive information.




Beyond these basics, all CASBs offer the potential to operate in one (or more) of three different modes:




Forward proxy, usually deployed with endpoint agents or VPN clients.



Reverse proxy, which doesn’t require agents and can work better for unmanaged devices.



API control, which provides visibility into data already stored in cloud repositories or data that is used in a cloud process that never enters a corporate network.




Feature sets across CASB operational modes vary



Part of the CASB evaluation challenge is understanding how the feature set extends to each operational mode if indeed the product operates in more than one mode. Broadcom’s Symantec CASB, for example, has reverse proxies just for Microsoft 365 and no other application. Meanwhile, Cisco Systems and Palo Alto Networks both offer API-only CASB products. Such differences mean you need to understand the types of protection and not just which apps are supported but how they are supported, and what is the exact API portfolio that is covered by each product.



You really need the API support if you want to get granular with your CASB protection to understand the state of your public cloud security exposure and to stop any cloud-based malware too. API deployments also can trap cloud-to-cloud activities and to retrospectively inspect archived traffic flows. You will also need some level of proxying to handle application gateways and for implementing specific security policies. It pays to read the fine print and develop an appropriate test plan that will reveal the relevant features for each vendors’ product.



Nice-to-have sets of CASB features:




Conduct continuous risk assessments and compliance audits on demand: A CASB can show in a single place where a corporation has the most risk and summarizes issues that a security team can quickly focus on for suspicious behavior that other products couldn’t easily do.




Forcepoint, Netskope, and Proofpoint all have nice risk summary dashboards that you can customize to display the things you need to understand how your environment is behaving and what needs immediate attention.




Apply uniform adaptive authentication policies across all logins, servers, and apps: This should include read-only access (Gartner suggests this would be a good situation for unsanctioned SaaS services that are nonetheless needed), step-up authentication, and more granular access rights management.




Identity management and single sign-on (SSO) tools are the usual go-to reasons for these sorts of tasks, and one important trend is that more CASBs are integrating with traditional SSO products. The trick is to understand that the typical level of integration happens (usually) in reverse proxy mode only, and the SSO authentication is only passed to the CASB at the initial application login moment. This means that if you want a more complete adaptive authentication to trap when more risky behavior happens, you will probably have to stick with your dedicated SSO product.



As you can see, CASBs touch a lot of different existing security products across your enterprise. The challenge for successful integration is being able to understand these interactions and ensure that you overall security profile is enhanced rather than degraded with their use.



Leading cloud access security broker (CASB) vendors



The list of leading CASB vendors (in alphabetical order) includes pure-play companies as well as traditional security vendors that have added CASB capabilities to their portfolios either by acquisition or through internal development. Most vendors would not share their pricing details, but we have found approximate clues on AWS and Azure marketplaces where we could.



Cloudflare CASB is an add-on to their One SASE platform, using the same overall agent. There is a free version for under 50 users which allows two SaaS components, and prices start at $7/user/month above that level, with custom pricing for larger installations. The CASB product is now four years old and integrates with visibility and control of various AI services such as ChatGPT and Google Gemini. It doesn’t support reverse proxies, includes DLP and integrates with the risk scores and metadata sources available with Microsoft’s cloud services, such as with protecting Office 365 documents and emails.



Cisco Cloudlock:Cisco Systems has had a CASB since it acquired Cloudlock back in 2016. Cisco Cloudlock is a cloud-native CASB that protects users, data, and apps with an automated approach that uses APIs to manage the risks in the cloud app ecosystem. It integrates with Cisco’s SSE platform for its protective policies and a uniform dashboard. Cloudlock uses advanced machine learning algorithms to detect anomalies. It also provides DLP functionality and targets shadow IT with policy-based controls that can block dangerous activities, depending on permissions and risk levels. It uses machine learning to produce risk scores for more than 1,300 applications along with having tools to manage AI supply chains.



Forcepoint ONE CASB: Forcepoint bought Bitglass in 2021, one of the original standalone CASB vendors and a leader in Gartner’s Magic Quadrant for CASB. Forcepoint has integrated Bitglass technology with its own DLP capabilities to provide an SSE solution. Forcepoint excels in monitoring and reporting on shadow IT, and its user analytics feature is popular. The software also supports a zero-trust architecture, providing device and user authentication. Pricing is $120 per user per year on AWS Marketplace.

Netskope merged SWG functionality into its CASB tool and sells separate in-line and API versions each for $35,000 per year for 100 users on AWS Marketplace.



Palo Alto Networks Prisma CASB. Palo Alto Networks touts its CASB as being “next-generation,” based on the proposition that it’s less a standalone product and more of a range of integrated solutions such as inline security, SSPM, and enterprise DLP. The Palo Alto Networks CASB is designed to secure apps and data across cloud and hybrid workforce environments, protects data in transit between users and SaaS providers, facilities regulatory compliance and minimizes risks from shadow IT.



Proofpoint’s CASB is focused on extending DLP and threat protection from email to cloud apps. Proofpoint takes a people-centric approach; it provides granular visibility into who creates sensitive data and who owns, downloads, uploads, shares and edits that data. It identifies users who have been successfully phished, and those who have been attacked the most by hackers.



Skyhigh Security CASB supports all deployment modes and enables real-time control over user access to sanctioned and unsanctioned cloud services. Skyhigh (a unit of Indian IT tech provider Musarubra that also owns Trellix) focuses on providing comprehensive multimode coverage that feeds security events into a machine learning system to provide sophisticated event correlation, helping security teams to focus on real threats rather than false alarms. CASB is just part of its overall SSE platform which integrates across SWG, ZTNA, DSPM and DLP, along with remote browser isolation. Protective policies are developed platform-wide and include management of AI usage and prevention of shadow AI and crafting user risk scores from all these metrics. Pricing is based on per protected service per user per year, the unlimited services is $88/user/year, with extra charges for shadow services.



Symantec, a division of Broadcom, offers its CloudSOC CASB to monitor and control the use of sanctioned SaaS apps through extensive API integrations and in-line traffic analysis. The Symantec CASB provides full visibility and automatic detection of high-risk users, compromised accounts, and malicious insiders. Individualized behavioral-based user threat scores allow fast identification of risky user accounts. The tool automates the classification regulated data flowing in and out of apps, and it enforces controls that align with corporate policies. The tool includes DLP functionality and CSPM.



Versa’s CASB is part of its One Universal SSE Platform that contains a unified dashboard and policy rule set for a variety of security services, including DLP, ZTNA, applications firewall, analytics and reporting. All its modules were entirely developed in-house, include various AI-based tools, and it supports all three modes of operation.  Users can create protective policies using natural language queries of its embedded AI, as well as explore alerts and remediations.



Zscaler CASB offers inline, real-time capabilities and out-of-band scanning functionality to protect data, block threats, provide visibility, and assure compliance. Key features include agentless cloud browser isolation to secure BYOD and third-party devices where software installations are infeasible, advanced threat protection to stop malware from reaching cloud resources in real time, cloud sandboxing to detect new ransomware and other zero-day infections, shadow IT discovery to automatically identify unsanctioned apps used by employees and create a risk score for each. It uses AI to classify and detect data leaks and will have additional AI-based tools in early 2026.



What to ask before buying a CASB tool



Buying a CASB tool can be complex. There’s a laundry list of possible features that fall within the broad CASB definition (DLP, SWG, etc.) And CASB tools themselves are part of a larger trend toward SSE and SASE platforms that include features such as ZTNA or SD-WAN. Enterprises need to identify their specific pain points — whether that’s regulatory compliance or shadow IT — and select a vendor that meets their immediate needs and can also grow with the enterprise over time. Here are the key questions to ask yourself before buying a CASB tool:




Do I have a good handle on what cloud services my users are accessing, including employees, contractors, and other third-parties?



Do I have a solid data classification system in place, so that I know what types of data are sensitive or mission critical?



Do I have policies in place for access control across both on-prem and cloud environments, including SaaS applications?



Do I have clear objectives? What are my priorities when shopping for a CASB?



How will a CASB tool integrate with my existing security infrastructure such as firewalls, endpoint protection and web gateways. Examine how it will protect my entire applications’ estate, including custom-written apps. What happens as I migrate apps from on-premises to the cloud or in reverse?



Do I get DLP and SWG as part of the CASB, or are those additional modules?



How will the purchase of a CASB tool play into my broader security roadmap that might include the adoption of SSE or SASE?



What is the initial cost, as well as the longer-term total cost of ownership?



Do I have the budget for a new tool?



Can your product scale as my company grows?



Does your product cover all the geographic regions where I operate?



Do I have the inhouse staff to deploy and manage the tool on-premises, or should I take the cloud-based, managed service route?

The devil of proposed SEC AI disclosure rule is in the details,"
		
					  
						




A US Securities and Exchange Commission committee has recommended a new rule that would mandate companies to analyze and report all AI efforts — including decisions to not use AI for some purposes. 



Attorneys who have studied the proposal note that the AI rule — just like the SEC’s cybersecurity rule from about two years ago — won’t technically require anything to be reported that wouldn’t have already required reporting. The new rule refers only to material AI efforts and ever since the creation of the SEC some 90 years ago, anything material has always required disclosure.



But they theorize that the SEC committee believes that many public-company boards and their senior executives don’t fully understand the scope and potential impact of their various AI efforts. The new rule would force those executives to create committees and to formally review all AI decisions, potentially unearthing material issues that would otherwise not have occurred to those executives. 



Cybersecurity consultant Brian Levine, a former federal prosecutor who today serves as executive director of FormerGov, argues that this extra focus could make a significant difference for many enterprises. 



“It will help focus people. It puts it in front of everyone who needs to be thinking about AI,” Levine said. 



As for requiring companies to examine and disclose where they are either not using or where they might be underinvesting compared to rivals, Levine said that could help executives understand “that there is a risk that our implementation of AI may not keep up with stakeholders and competitors.”



The proposed rule comes from the SEC Investor Advisory Committee (IAC) and was discussed during the Dec. 4 IAC meeting. 



Companies can write their own definitions of AI



Another controversial aspect of the proposed rule is that it fails to define AI, instead instructing companies to write their own definitions. Some legal experts have suggested that the committee didn’t literally want companies to evaluate all uses of AI, given that the technology dates back to the 1950s and exists in some form in just about every piece of software that businesses use. They more likely intended for such evaluations to focus on relatively recent AI popularizations, especially generative AI and agentic AI. 



Under the proposed rule, companies would “self-define what they mean by artificial intelligence and then rely on that definition throughout its disclosures in describing AI-related risks, their AI deployment strategy if any and capital expenses and R&amp;D expenditures related to the implementation and deployment of AI, amongst other material information.”



Monica Washington Rothbaum, a senior attorney with J&amp;Y Law, said that it would be “risky for a company to define AI differently” because it makes “apple to apple” investor comparisons difficult if not impossible.



“Requiring companies to disclose AI-related risks is a smart move. But letting each company define AI however they see fit is a loophole waiting to be exploited. Without a consistent baseline, you risk turning disclosures into PR spin rather than meaningful accountability,” Rothbaum said. 



But Rothbaum does find value in forcing companies to disclose where management has opted to not use AI or to use it less than they might have otherwise. 



“Under-disclosing material risks like reliance on flawed AI models can expose companies to liability when things go wrong. Failing to invest in AI responsibly could also lead to competitive disadvantages that shareholders deserve to know about,” Rothbaum said. “This isn’t theoretical. AI is already shaping the way we look at hiring, customer service, and security. These are core operations that can affect a company’s value. If you can’t clearly explain how your AI decisions are made and who’s accountable for making them, then you’re already behind. Transparency like that has to be the cost of doing business today.”



Braden Perry, a litigation, regulatory, and government investigations attorney with law firm Kennyhertz Perry, is not a fan of the proposed rule because he sees it unlikely to help investors make decisions. 



Asked the probability that such a rule would deliver useful information to investors and potential investors, Perry said, “None. In terms of an overall understanding from a shareholder, there will likely be zero usable information.”



Will filing reveal anything useful?



This concern is partly based on the many SEC cybersecurity filings that have used boilerplate language — and use SEC exemptions to reveal nothing specific.



According to Perry, the key part of the AI definition portion is that the definition — once used — has to be used consistently throughout all filings. 



“Adopt a clear, enterprise-wide definition of AI and use it consistently across SEC filings, internal policies, and marketing, so you do not redefine the term to suit the story you want to tell in a given quarter,” Perry said. “The IAC recommendation explicitly contemplates requiring issuers to define what they mean by AI, in part because inconsistent definitions are already making disclosures hard for investors to compare. Allowing companies to define AI themselves is a double-edged sword, since it can either promote honest, business-specific clarity or invite opportunistic word games.”



Some attorneys suggested that companies should be careful about AI phrasing or face potential actions from the SEC and the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC). 



“Be very cautious about AI marketing. The SEC has already shown, through its AI washing enforcement actions, that it is willing to charge firms that exaggerate their AI capabilities or mislead investors about how embedded AI is in their products and processes,” Perry said. “A disclosure regime that asks companies to explain where AI is used, how it is governed, and how it affects operations will only make it easier for the SEC to test whether those claims are real.”



Lexi Reese, CEO of AI vendor Lanai, also expressed concern about allowing companies to write their own AI definitions.



“Giving companies the freedom to define AI may reduce short-term compliance friction, but it creates exactly the kind of fragmented, incomparable disclosure environment that leaves investors guessing,” Reese said. “If one company calls an autonomous decision system AI and another calls the same thing a data-driven tool, their disclosures will look compliant while describing two different universes of risk.”



AI specialist Rob Lee, chief of research for the cybersecurity training firm the SANS Institute, said the rule might prove helpful in raising board and C-level awareness about what companies are actually doing with AI. 



But as with the earlier SEC cybersecurity rule, Lee said he was unhappy that the rule includes “a massive number of get-out-of-jail-free cards. Who is going to actually disclose anything? What are they disclosing? They don’t even mention shadow IT. How do you track unsanctioned AI use in your company?”



Not even all members of the IAC were happy with the rule’s phrasing. IAC member John Gulliver submitted an official dissent to the proposed rule, expressing particular concern with each company’s ability to write its own AI definition. 



“These definitions would likely change from year-to-year or quarter-to-quarter. I don’t see how this benefits investors,” Gulliver wrote. But he also said that he doubted the details required are realistic. 



The proposed rule would “require public companies to provide highly specific disclosures of how their use of AI impacts employees at their company and the company’s customers. It’s good that this is only required when the use of AI is financially material to the company. But unfortunately, I think this is an impossible task,” Gulliver wrote. “Does the SEC really have the AI expertise necessary to determine what these line-item disclosures should be? And how is a company supposed to know the precise impact of AI on hiring or their customers? There are many macroeconomic and industry-specific factors that affect jobs and customers. In my view, accurately isolating AI-specific impacts would be a difficult guessing game.”

"Tesla used deceptive language to market Autopilot, California judge rules","Tesla’s sales in California should be suspended for 30 days because its marketing around Autopilot and Full Self-Driving misled consumers, a California administrative law judge has ruled. Back in 2022, the California DMV accused the automaker of using deceptive language to advertise those products and making  it seem like its vehicles are capable of level 5 autonomous driving. Tesla has since added the word “Supervised” to the name of its Full Self-Driving assistance technology.  As Bloomberg notes, the DMV asked the administrative law judge if a suspension is warranted based on the evidence it presented. Even though the judge has agreed that it is, the agency will give Tesla 90 days to explain its side and remove any untrue or misleading language in the marketing materials for the products. Tesla’s sales and manufacturing in California will only be suspended if it doesn’t comply within that timeframe.“We’re really asking Tesla to do their job, as they’ve done in other markets, to properly brand these vehicles,” said California DMV director, Steve Gordon, in a statement.A suspension in California could be devastating for the automaker. While new Tesla registrations in the state plummeted earlier this year, Reuters says California accounts for nearly a third of the company’s sales in the country. In addition, Tesla only manufactures its Model S and X vehicles in its Fremont plant, where it also produces Model 3 and Model Y units.

FortiGate firewall credentials being stolen after vulnerabilities discovered,"
		
					  
						




Threat actors aren’t wasting time taking advantage of newly-revealed vulnerabilities in Fortinet device authentication.



Researchers at Arctic Wolf said they are seeing malicious single sign on (SSO) attempts trying to leverage the holes in FortiGate next generation firewalls since Fortinet alerted admins about the vulnerabilities on December 9.



“We have seen tens of intrusions since December 12, 2025,” a spokesperson for Arctic Wolf Labs told CSO. “So far, the pattern of activity has appeared to be opportunistic in nature. While it is difficult to estimate the number of devices directly vulnerable to this vulnerability, there are hundreds of thousands of Fortinet appliances accessible on the public internet through specialized search engines. This allows threat actors to opportunistically attempt exploitation against large swaths of devices at once.”



Arctic Wolf’s advisory says admins who see malicious activity in their logs should assume that hashed firewall credentials stored in the exfiltrated configurations have been compromised, and reset those credentials “as soon as possible.” 



On Tuesday, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency added one of the vulnerabilities, CVE-2025-59718, to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog. If a flaw is listed in the catalog, federal civilian executive branch agencies have to immediately remediate the affected product or service. CISA says that any listing should also be seen by private sector IT departments as a warning to prioritize their own remediation or patching.



Among other things, hackers exploiting the vulnerabilities could access Fortinet device configuration files to accelerate a breach of security controls.



The authentication bypass vulnerabilities, CVE-2025-59718 and CVE-2025-59719, are in the Fortinet FortiOS operating system that runs FortiWeb, FortiProxy and FortiSwitchManager devices. If exploited, they may allow an unauthenticated attacker to bypass the FortiCloud SSO login authentication, if that feature is enabled on the device.



For some admins, it may have been unknowingly turned on; when administrators register devices using the FortiCare product support portal, FortiCloud SSO is automatically enabled unless they disable the “Allow administrative login using FortiCloud SSO” setting on the registration page. 



To prevent being affected by this vulnerability, admins should turn off the FortiCloud login feature, if enabled, then upgrade software to the latest version before re-enabling the function.



Fortinet acted quickly to patch the authentication bypass vulnerabilities, said Piyush Sharma, CEO of Tuskira, a vulnerability platform provider.



“However,” he added, “the speed at which threat actors exploit newly discovered flaws continues to outpace traditional patch cycles, underscoring the critical need for agentic AI systems that provide continuous, real-time exposure management and autonomous threat response.”



He noted that any configuration files that have been exfiltrated could allow hackers to map network architecture and identify vulnerable interfaces and points of failure to be used in targeted attack campaigns or exploitation, and weak passwords could be cracked offline and allow attackers to pass as legitimate users and move laterally across networks. “The combination of this information sets the stage for potentially dangerous and highly precise cyberattacks, which could lead to data theft or even total network compromise,” he warned.



Vulnerable organizations that haven’t implemented Fortinet’s released patches should do so immediately, he said.



As well, all organizations should practice credential rotation and implement principles of least privilege to prevent data from being unnecessarily leaked, he added. 



Beyond following Fortinet’s advice on upgrading its device software, Arctic Wolf also urges admins to follow the manufacturer’s best practices for hardening its devices.

Russian APT group pivots to network edge device misconfigurations,"
		
					  
						




A Russian state-sponsored cyberespionage group has been targeting energy companies and critical infrastructure providers by exploiting misconfigurations in network-edge devices.



The group has been operating since at least 2021 and has exploited device misconfigurations before but also known vulnerabilities such as CVE-2022-26318 in WatchGuard Firebox and XTM appliances, CVE-2021-26084 and CVE-2023-22518 in Confluence or CVE-2023-2753 in Veeam Backup.



However, according to telemetry collected by Amazon Threat Intelligence, the group has heavily focused on targeting misconfigurations this year, pivoting away from zero-day or N-day vulnerabilities. The main targets have been enterprise routers and routing infrastructure, VPN concentrators and remote access gateways, network management appliances, collaboration and wiki platforms and cloud-based project management systems.



“This tactical adaptation enables the same operational outcomes, credential harvesting, and lateral movement into victim organizations’ online services and infrastructure, while reducing the actor’s exposure and resource expenditure,” the researchers found.



Links to Sandworm and Curly COMrades



According to Amazon’s telemetry, the group’s infrastructure has overlaps with Sandworm, a group also known as APT44 and Seashell Blizzard that’s associated with Russia’s military intelligence agency, the GRU. There are also overlaps with a group whose activity was documented in the past by security firm Bitdefender, under the name Curly COMrades.



However, these could be subgroups within the GRU that work together, with the one tracked by Amazon handling initial access and lateral movement and Curly COMrades handling the host persistence through its CurlyShell and CurlCat custom malware implants.



Amazon detected attacks against customer network edge appliances hosted on AWS EC2 instances with actor-controlled IP addresses achieving persistent connections that indicate interactive access to the compromised devices.



Credential harvesting



The researchers also observed credential replay attacks against victims’ other online services using stolen domain credentials following network edge device compromises. This indicates that the attackers are likely harvesting credentials by leveraging the traffic capturing and analysis capabilities of the compromised devices.



“Time gap between device compromise and authentication attempts against victim services suggests passive collection rather than active credential theft,” the researchers found.



Network traffic interception is consistent with Sandworm’s known tradecraft and the targeting of network edge devices specifically positions the attackers to intercept credentials in transit.



How critical infrastructure providers can defend against this threat



The group has a strong focus on the energy sector, with victims including electric utility companies, energy providers and even MSSPs with energy sector clients. However, it has also targeted technology and service cloud providers, as well as telecommunications companies across multiple regions.



The Amazon Threat Intelligence team advises organizations to audit their network edge devices for packet capture files or utilities that shouldn’t be present, to review their device configurations and isolate management interfaces, and implement multi-factor authentication.



Companies should also review authentication logs and monitor authentication attempts from unexpected geographic locations. Anomaly detection for authentication patterns should be implemented for all online services and the use of plain text protocols that could expose credentials in transit should be audited.



The Amazon report includes indicators of compromise associated with this attack campaign as well as security recommendations specific to AWS environments.

X was spooked enough by new Twitter to change its terms of service,"Despite changing its name and using decidedly bird-free branding, X is trying to hold on to its original Twitter trademarks, TechCrunch reports. The xAI-owned social media platform has updated its terms of service to include references to Twitter after previously only mentioning X, and seemingly attempted to counter a startup&#39;s petition to cancel the company&#39;s Twitter trademarks with a petition of its own.The startup X appears to be responding to is Operation Bluebird, a company cofounded by former Twitter general counsel Stephen Coates that went public last week with plans to capture what remains of Twitter for its own use. The first step in that process was filing a petition with the US Patents and Trademark Office to cancel X&#39;s control of Twitter’s trademarks.&#34;The TWITTER and TWEET brands have been eradicated from X Corp.’s products, services and marketing, effectively abandoning the storied brand, with no intention to resume use of the mark,&#34; Operation Bluebird explained in the petition. “Petitioner seeks to use and register the TWITTER and TWEET brands for new products and services, including a social media platform that will be located at the website twitter.new.&#34;In fairness to Operation Bluebird, Elon Musk was very open about his plan to abandon the Twitter name and bird logo after he acquired the company in 2022. &#34;And soon we shall bid adieu to the twitter brand and, gradually, all the birds,&#34; Musk posted in July 2022, not long before Twitter was rebranded to X. Even after the platform rebranded, though, at least one remnant of the original Twitter brand has stuck around: Twitter.com still redirects to X.com.And soon we shall bid adieu to the twitter brand and, gradually, all the birds— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 23, 2023
 

The updated terms of service TechCrunch spotted now say that as of January 16, 2025, &#34;nothing in the Terms gives you a right to use the X name or Twitter name or any of the X or Twitter trademarks, logos, domain names, other distinctive brand features, and other proprietary rights, and you may not do so without our express written consent.&#34; The company&#39;s counterpetition also reiterates that the Twitter trademarks are X&#39;s &#34;exclusive property.&#34;Engadget has contacted Operation Bluebird for a response to X&#39;s petition. We&#39;ll update this article if we hear back.At the time of writing, Operation Bluebird has convinced over 145,200 people to claim a handle on the company&#39;s new social platform. Maybe X sees that early interest as a threat, but it&#39;s just as possible Operation Bluebird&#39;s public comments were enough to tip the company off so it could try to hold on to trademarks it clearly believes still hold some value.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/x-was-spooked-enough-by-new-twitter-to-change-its-terms-of-service-231138305.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2F2025-12%2Fa998e5e7-4419-4403-807e-fee32a303bc7&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=5a8e5f64ce3e824542af30cca186e99563e700e9,https://www.engadget.com/social-media/x-was-spooked-enough-by-new-twitter-to-change-its-terms-of-service-231138305.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-16T23:11:38Z,11,Tech

Steam Replay 2025 is here to recap your PC gaming habits,"‘Tis the season for gift-giving, family feasts and companies turning their harvested user data into lighthearted recaps. Valve&#39;s take on the year-end rewind, Steam Replay, is now available. It follows similar offerings from Spotify, Apple Music, PlayStation and, increasingly, just about every service you use. Hell, even Uber and The New York Times somehow justified getting in on the action this year.This is the fourth edition of Valve’s wrap-up, which looks back on the titles you spent the most time with in 2025. You’ll find your top games, the number of titles you played, achievements unlocked and longest streaks. You can see how your habits break down by genre, Steam Deck use and whether they&#39;re new releases, recent or classic games. Monthly breakdowns and the percentage of time played (by title) are also included.The review compares your stats to the average Steam user. For example, I played 28 games this year; the Steam median is only four. My longest play streak was 15 days; the median is six. I’m only an intermittent gamer, so people who barely play at all are clearly weighing down the averages.You can check out your Steam Replay 2025 by heading to the website and logging in.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/steam-replay-2025-is-here-to-recap-your-pc-gaming-habits-205430951.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2FG8UHVKuaoAAedLM.jpg&resize=1400%2C840&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=0471c305f4560b7e7f77e3b78f7df6fbf8cbb3b0,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/steam-replay-2025-is-here-to-recap-your-pc-gaming-habits-205430951.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-16T20:54:30Z,8,Tech
The last Xbox update of 2025 includes a handy Wireless Headset upgrade,"As part of its last Xbox-focused software update of the year, Microsoft is improving the Bluetooth performance of the Xbox Wireless Headset to make it work even better with Windows 11. Microsoft released the latest Wireless Headset as an accessory for Xbox Series X/S and PC, but as of this update, Xbox Wireless Headset owners on Windows will now have a leg up on their console counterparts thanks to support for Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) Audio.Microsoft says that supporting Bluetooth LE Audio will let the headset offer lower latency audio, better battery life, richer stereo sound and the ability to share audio across multiple compatible Bluetooth accessories at the same time. Not revolutionary updates, but still nice to have if you bought a $110 Xbox Wireless Headset back in 2024. Provided you&#39;re running the latest version of Windows 11 and your device supports Bluetooth LE, Microsoft says you can take advantage of the improvements by updating your headset in the Xbox Accessories app.If you&#39;re a regular user of the Xbox mobile app, Microsoft is also making some changes there. After adding the ability to purchase Xbox games directly from the app in April — a feature made possible after Google and Apple were forced to change the rules of their app stores — Microsoft is now adding a dedicated Store tab to the app. You&#39;ll also be able to add games to your wishlist and search for add-ons and DLC directly in the app.Microsoft ending the year with Windows and mobile app updates reflects the ways the company&#39;s gaming strategy has changed in 2025. After spending decades positioning itself as a console maker, Microsoft is seemingly making Xbox software its main focus going forward.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/the-last-xbox-update-of-2025-includes-a-handy-wireless-headset-upgrade-204500386.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2024-10%2F6e6bfbd0-9087-11ef-be6f-de4928f8ddad&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=ad40d70122d73a4f9d308ed51beed5da85ce9de2,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/the-last-xbox-update-of-2025-includes-a-handy-wireless-headset-upgrade-204500386.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-16T20:45:00Z,9,Tech

Texas sues five TV manufacturers over predatory ad-targeting spyware,"Behold: Ken Paxton will now demonstrate that broken clocks are indeed right twice a day. The Texas Attorney General is notorious for, well, a very long list of reasons. But in this case, he at least appears to be doing consumers a solid: He sued five television companies for using ad-targeting spyware on their TVs.Texas sued Sony, Samsung, LG, Hisense and TCL for allegedly recording what viewers watch without their consent. The predatory technology, Automated Content Recognition (ACR), identifies the content being played on a device by matching short content fingerprints to a database.ACR is essentially a Shazam for video. Except in this case, its sole purpose is to target your viewing habits to help line advertisers&#39; pockets. &#34;This software can capture screenshots of a user&#39;s television display every 500 milliseconds, monitor viewing activity in real time and transmit that information back to the company without the user&#39;s knowledge or consent,&#34; Paxton&#39;s press release says.An LG Ad Solutions website boasts how ACR helps advertisers &#34;target by content viewership, including show, network, app, service or genre.&#34; Since it works with anything running on the device, it can identify purchases and subscriptions, track gamers&#39; habits and pinpoint users by region, city or zip code.There should be a setting on your TV to turn it off. But, as Texas&#39; lawsuit against LG notes, TV software often &#34;deceptively guides consumers to activate ACR and buries any explanation of what that means in dense legal jargon that few will read or understand.&#34;Paxton&#39;s press release emphasized Hisense and TCL&#39;s home base of China. &#34;These Chinese ties pose serious concerns about consumer data harvesting and are exacerbated by China&#39;s National Security Law, which gives its government the capability to get its hands on US consumer data,&#34; the statement reads.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/texas-sues-five-tv-manufacturers-over-predatory-ad-targeting-spyware-201500248.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2F613cdff0-cbc5-11ef-bdeb-cd552c9b8ab1.png&resize=1400%2C729&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=012f95a988d497279a7db3669b24a066b8710b64,https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/texas-sues-five-tv-manufacturers-over-predatory-ad-targeting-spyware-201500248.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-16T20:15:00Z,9,Tech

YouTube is letting creators make playable games with a Gemini 3 tool,"Google&#39;s at it again, once more insisting that AI is something people need or want more of in their lives. The latest move comes from YouTube Gaming, which announced an open beta for a project called Playables Builder. This allows select YouTube Creators to use a &#34;prototype web app built using Gemini 3&#34; to make bite-sized games, no coding required. YouTube is launching a closed Beta test for Playables Builder, a prototype web app built using Gemini 3 where users create games with short text, video or image prompts. we’ve partnered with YouTube Creators like @sambucha, @AyChristene, @goharsguide and @Mogswamp to start making… pic.twitter.com/1Gx0v4oZFA— YouTube Gaming (@YouTubeGaming) December 16, 2025
 

YouTube was testing the addition of small-scale games to its desktop and mobile platforms back in 2023, then added multiplayer capability to Playables last year. Since AI is appearing all over Google-owned services, today&#39;s news probably shouldn&#39;t be a surprise.   The premise sounds similar to the Disco and GenTabs projects that Google Labs recently announced. They offer an AI layer to web browsing: provide a natural language input, get an interactive widget that does what you asked for. Despite my skeptical attitude toward AI, I can see those tools having some practical applications for search, where the goal is to aggregate whatever data you&#39;re looking for into a manageable, easy-to-read interface. But a game is not simple. A good game takes what might be a simple idea and, with finesse and iteration and skill, transforms it into a genuinely fun experience. It&#39;s a cute parlor trick that AI assistants can help people to make stuff without technical knowledge, but there&#39;s a reason professional game devs work hard to amass all their know-how. Playables Builder is a peak example of misunderstanding what artificial intelligence is best at. Just because a chatbot can make a game doesn&#39;t mean anyone will enjoy playing it.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/youtube-is-letting-creators-make-playable-games-with-a-gemini-3-tool-195500318.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2FScreenshot_2025-12-16_at_1.15.51%25E2%2580%25AFPM.png&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=286d2b089abe6a5d3a3ae2660758b0876ddc434a,https://www.engadget.com/ai/youtube-is-letting-creators-make-playable-games-with-a-gemini-3-tool-195500318.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-16T19:55:00Z,13,Tech

Crunchyroll annual subscriptions are on sale for the holidays,"If you&#39;re looking for something to watch during a holiday break from work or school, you can&#39;t go wrong with anime, and right now you can sign-up for a year of Crunchyroll for as low as $65. Holiday discounts running through December 29 bring the anime streaming service&#39;s year-long Fan subscription from $80 down to $67 and its Mega Fan subscription from $120 down to $100. That&#39;s either $13 or $20 off access to one of the largest libraries of anime series and movies out there. 
While both the Fan and Mega Fan plans are ad-free, you do get some different benefits depending on which you decide to pay for. Fan subscribers get full access to Crunchyroll&#39;s library, new episodes &#34;shortly after they air in Japan&#34; and five percent off select purchases in the Crunchyroll Store. Mega Fan subscribers get all those benefits, plus the ability to stream on four devices at the same time, download HD quality episodes and movies to view offline, play games from the Crunchyroll Game Vault and receive 10 percent off select products in the Crunchyroll Store. 

  
Notably missing from either subscription is access to Crunchyroll&#39;s new Manga service, but unless you&#39;re specifically looking for reading material, you&#39;ll get plenty of entertainment out of Crunchyroll&#39;s video library. Outside of Netflix, which produces and licenses its own growing collection of anime, Crunchyroll is the de facto place to watch Japanese animation in the US. You&#39;ll find long-running series like One Piece and newer hits like Spy X Family, alongside hundreds of more niche series. 
Crunchyroll has its issues, of course. Since the streaming service was acquired by Sony, it&#39;s been particularly interested in using generative AI to subtitle shows, which has already produced poor results. It&#39;s hard to beat Crunchyroll&#39;s library, though, and for as little as $65, you&#39;ll get more than your money&#39;s worth.

Netflix will soon start airing video podcasts like The Breakfast Club,"Netflix has inked a deal with iHeartMedia to begin showing video podcasts, so the content will never, ever run out. The partnership covers new episodes from more than 15 popular podcasts, including The Breakfast Club, Dear Chelsea, My Favorite Murder and others. Customers will have access to video podcast episodes in early 2026. 
In addition to new footage, the partnership includes a select library of archival episodes from each show. It&#39;s worth noting that YouTube already platforms video versions of many popular podcasts, including stuff like The Breakfast Club.
This follows a similar deal from earlier this year in which Netflix announced plans to stream video podcast episodes from Spotify. That partnership covers stuff like The Bill Simmons Podcast and The Zach Lowe Show, among others.
Many people use podcasts for background noise and soon Netflix will be a major player in that market, such as it is. Disney+ also recently started prioritizing those &#34;barely paying attention&#34; eyeballs, as it inked its own deal to air The Rich Eisen Show on weekdays.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/netflix-will-soon-start-airing-video-podcasts-like-the-breakfast-club-193112093.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2Fb5f6b930-dab0-11f0-8dff-b9a40276cb17&resize=1400%2C877&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=10e4b925ae4f67e1e1fa78e619980525f0263054,https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/netflix-will-soon-start-airing-video-podcasts-like-the-breakfast-club-193112093.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-16T19:31:12Z,7,Tech

Meta is rolling out Conversation Focus and AI-powered Spotify features to its smart glasses,"Back in September during Meta Connect, the company previewed a new ability for its smart glasses lineup called Conversation Focus. The feature, which is able to amplify the voices of people around you, is now starting to roll out in the company&#39;s latest batch of software updates.When enabled, the feature is meant to make it easier to hear the people you&#39;re speaking with in a crowded or otherwise noisy environment. &#34;You’ll hear the amplified voice sound slightly brighter, which will help you distinguish the conversation from ambient background noise,” Meta explains. It can be enabled either via voice commands (&#34;hey Meta, start Conversation Focus&#34;) or by adding it as a dedicated &#34;tap-and-hold&#34; shortcut. Meta is also adding a new multimodal AI feature for Spotify. With the update, users can ask their glasses to play music on Spotify that corresponds with what they&#39;re looking at by saying “hey Meta, play a song to match this view.” Spotify will then start a playlist &#34;based on your unique taste, customized for that specific moment.&#34; For example, looking at holiday decor might trigger a similarly-themed playlist, though it&#39;s not clear how Meta and Spotify may translate more abstract concepts into themed playlists. Both updates are starting to roll out now to Meta Ray-Ban glasses (both Gen 1 and Gen 2 models), as well as the Oakley Meta HSTN frames. The update will arrive first to those enrolled in Meta&#39;s early access program, and will be available &#34;gradually&#34; to everyone else.Meta&#39;s newest mode of smart glasses, the Oakley Meta Vanguard shades, are also getting some new features in the latest software update. Meta is adding the option to trigger specific commands with a single word, rather than having to say &#34;hey Meta.&#34; For example, saying &#34;photo&#34; will be enough to snap a picture and saying &#34;video&#34; will start a new recording. The company says the optional feature is meant to help athletes &#34;save some breath&#34; while on a run or bike ride. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/meta-is-rolling-out-conversation-focus-and-ai-powered-spotify-features-to-its-smart-glasses-192133928.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2Frayban_meta_on_top_case.jpg&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=9dc34aca058f152daf301de55c2e9104326f2fc0,https://www.engadget.com/wearables/meta-is-rolling-out-conversation-focus-and-ai-powered-spotify-features-to-its-smart-glasses-192133928.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-16T19:21:33Z,10,Tech

CES 2026 preview: What we're expecting from tech's biggest conference in January,"CES doesn&#39;t start until January, but whispers of the products and announcements that could be in store for tech&#39;s biggest annual conference have already started to take shape. The CES 2026 show floor is officially open from January 6 through 9, although the show kicks off with events on Sunday January 4 and a host of press conferences on Monday. As always, product demos, announcements and networking will be happening at the Las Vegas Convention Center and surrounding hotels all over the city. As usual, Engadget will be covering the event in-person and remotely, bringing you news and hands-ons straight from the show floor.More specific details and pre-announcements should trickle out as CES approaches, but in the meantime, we do know what companies will be hosting press conferences and what tech trends could rear their heads at the show.What we already know aboutPress conferences and show floor booths are the bread and butter of CES. The Consumer Technology Association has already published a searchable directory of who will have a presence at the show, along with a schedule of every official panel and presentation.On Sunday, January 4, Samsung will kick-off CES with &#34;The First Look,&#34; a presentation hosted by TM Roh, the CEO of Samsung&#39;s DX Division, on the company&#39;s &#34;vision for the DX (Device eXperience) Division in 2026, along with new AI-driven customer experiences.&#34; That&#39;ll be followed by multiple press conferences throughout Monday, January 5. LG is hosting its &#34;Innovation in Tune with You&#34; presentation to share &#34;its vision for elevating daily life through Affectionate Intelligence&#34; at the start of the day, Intel is launching its new Core Ultra Series 3 processors in the afternoon, Sony Honda Mobility is holding a press conference on its first car and AMD CEO Lisa Su will cover AMD&#39;s upcoming chip announcements at a keynote address that closes out the day.On the week of December 15, the CTA added a keynote by NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang to its schedule. The event will take place on January 5 at 1PM PT and, according to the website, will last about 90 minutes. Based on the description on the listing, the presentation will “showcase the latest NVIDIA solutions driving innovation and productivity across industries.”Finally, on Tuesday, January 6, Lenovo CEO Yuanqing Yang will host Lenovo&#39;s Tech World Conference at Sphere, using the large and decidedly curved screen to share the company&#39;s &#34;commitment to delivering smarter AI for all by constantly redefining how technology can engage, inspire, and empower.&#34; It’s worth noting that Lenovo is the parent company of Motorola, which still makes phones and foldables that feature AI tools, so it’s possible those devices feature in the presentation as well. Outside of the formal introduction of new products and initiatives, reading the tea leaves of what was announced last year and what companies are reportedly working on, we can make some educated guesses at what we could see at CES 2026.New chips from AMD, Intel and QualcommCES is frequently the start of a cascade of new chip announcements for a given year, and one of the first places new silicon appears in real consumer products. AMD will likely use its keynote to introduce new versions of its Ryzen chips, including the recently spotted Ryzen 7 9850X3D, which is expected to offer better single-threaded performance, and the Ryzen 9000G series, which could be built with AMD&#39;s Zen 5 architecture. The company might also use its CES stage to go over its new FSR Redstone AI upscaling tech.Intel has already publicly announced that it&#39;ll launch its Panther Lake chips at CES 2026. The officially titled Intel Core Ultra Series 3 chips fit into Intel&#39;s overall &#34;AI PC&#34; push, but are specifically meant for premium laptops. Based on a preview from October 2025, Intel says the first chip made with its 2-nanometer 18A process will offer 50 percent more processing performance than previous generations and for the chip&#39;s Arc GPU, a 50 percent performance bump from last generation.Qualcomm is also rumored to be targeting laptops at the show, building on the work it&#39;s done moving its Snapdragon chips out of phones and tablets and into other types of computers. The company&#39;s Snapdragon X2 Elite and X2 Elite Premium chips should start appearing in laptops at CES 2026, offering a look at the improved speed and AI performance the company promised in 2025.Brighter, &#34;truer&#34; screensSony announced a collection of new Bravia TVs in April 2025, replacing the company&#39;s flagship, filling in its midrange options and adding a new budget model to the mix. The star of this updated Bravia lineup is the Bravia 9, which features a QD-OLED panel, but Sony appears to be prepping entirely new display tech for 2026. In March 2025, Sony introduced a new RGB LED panel that uses individual Mini LED backlights colored in red, green and blue to produce even brighter, more accurate colors. In contrast to a QD-OLED, which filters a layer of blue organic light emitting diodes through quantum dots that change color, Sony&#39;s &#34;General RGB LED Backlight Technology&#34; can get as bright as a Mini LED panel without needing an extra filter layer or worrying about OLED&#39;s problems with burn-in. The company has already trademarked the name &#34;True RGB,&#34; which could end up being what Sony calls this new flavor of display if it decides to show them off at CES. It seems entirely likely, because CES is nothing if not a TV show — it’s a sure bet that we’ll see new TVs from the likes of LG and Samsung in addition to Sony. If the company doesn&#39;t introduce new display tech for its TVs, it does have a new 240Hz PlayStation monitor coming in 2026 that it could show off at CES instead.Sony isn&#39;t the only company hyped on bright screens. Samsung is reportedly pushing an updated version of the HDR10 and HDR10+ standards that could be ready to demo at CES 2026. The new HDR10+ Advanced standard would be Samsung&#39;s answer to Dolby Vision 2, which includes support for things bi-directional tone mapping and intelligent features that automatically adapt sports and gaming content. Samsung&#39;s take will reportedly offer improved brightness, genre-based tone mapping and intelligent motion smoothing options, among other improvements.Ballie Watch 2026The ball-shaped yellow robot lovingly known as &#34;Ballie&#34; has been announced twice, first in 2020 and then again in 2024 with a projector in tow. Samsung said Ballie would go on sale in 2025 at CES last year and then shared in April 2025 that Ballie would ship this summer with Google&#39;s Gemini onboard. But it&#39;s nearly 2026, and Ballie is nowhere to be seen. It&#39;s possible Samsung could make a third attempt at announcing its robot at CES 2026, but whether or not it does, robotics will still be a big part of the show.Robot vacuums and mops were a major highlight of CES 2025, and it&#39;s safe to expect notable improvements from the new models that are announced at CES 2026. Not every company will adopt the retractable arm of the Roborock Saros Z70, but robot vacuums with legs for rising over small ledges like the Dreame X50 seem like they could become the norm. Roborock could also show off its new Roborock Qrevo Curv 2 Flow, the first of its robot vacuums to feature a retractable roller mop.Beyond just traversing spaces more efficiently, improving robots&#39; navigation could also be a major concern at the show. Prominent members of the AI industry are turning their attention from large language models to world models, which aim to give AI a deep understanding of physical space. Those world models could be the key to making robots, bipedal or otherwise, competent at navigating homes and workplaces, and will likely be a significant talking point at CES 2026.We’ll be updating this article throughout the month as more rumors surface and new products are confirmed — stay tuned for future updates!Update, December 11 2025, 11:03AM ET: This story has been updated to include detail on Lenovo being Motorola’s parent company and how the latter might have a part in the Tuesday presentation.Update, December 16 2025, 1:33PM ET: This story has been updated to include the NVIDIA press conference, which was added to the CTA schedule within the last two days.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-preview-what-were-expecting-from-techs-biggest-conference-in-january-120000768.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2F2025-12%2Fe8dccbc3-be88-4b87-a625-47af0b588c1a&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=847468bf6a6f5a8a4b43b937b35806bdd0094027,https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-preview-what-were-expecting-from-techs-biggest-conference-in-january-120000768.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-16T18:36:35Z,22,Tech

ChatGPT image generation is now faster and better at following tweaks,"Following the release of GPT-5.2 last week, OpenAI has begun rolling out a new image generation model. The company says the updated ChatGPT Images is four times faster than its predecessor. If you&#39;re a frequent ChatGPT user, you&#39;ll know it can sometimes take a while for OpenAI&#39;s servers to create images, particularly during peak times and if you&#39;re not paying for ChatGPT Plus. In that respect, any improvement in speed is welcome. The new version is also better at following instructions, including when you want to edit something the new model just generated. You can ask the system to add, subtract, combine, blend and even transpose elements. At the same time, OpenAI says the update offers better text rendering. That&#39;s something many image models have traditionally struggled with, but according to the company, the new ChatGPT Images is capable of handling denser and smaller text. As part of the today&#39;s model update, OpenAI is additionally adding a dedicated Images section to the ChatGPT sidebar. Here you&#39;ll find preset filters and prompts you can look to for inspiration. The new ChatGPT Images arrives just as Nano Banana Pro is responsible for a surge in Gemini usage. In October, Google said its chatbot had 650 million users, up from 450 million just a few months earlier in July. Nano Banana Pro has proven so popular, the company recently limited free users to just two image generations per day. For OpenAI, a strong response to Nano Banana Pro probably wasn&#39;t as important as ensuring it came out swinging against Gemini 3 Pro, but ChatGPT Images is a big part of why there are 800 million ChatGPT users.    &#34;We believe we’re still at the beginning of what image generation can enable,&#34; OpenAI said. &#34;Today’s update is a meaningful step forward with more to come, from finer-grained edits to richer, more detailed outputs across languages.&#34;OpenAI is rolling out the new ChatGPT Images to all users starting today. If you&#39;re one of those people who miss GPT-4o, you&#39;ll be happy to learn you can continue to use the older version of the tool through a custom GPT.  This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/chatgpt-image-generation-is-now-faster-and-better-at-following-tweaks-180000750.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2Fchatgpt-how-to-lede-1.jpg&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=f82e455ad57a865dfacb89b10cc81f4f16b8337a,https://www.engadget.com/ai/chatgpt-image-generation-is-now-faster-and-better-at-following-tweaks-180000750.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-16T18:00:00Z,8,Tech

Rainbow Six Mobile will finally be available in February after years of testing,"The long-awaited Rainbow Six Mobile comes out on February 23 for iOS and Android devices. This is a global release and follows years of testing and some significant delays.

There&#39;s a team deathmatch, of course, and a pair of bomb-defusing games that are riffs on a pre-existing mode from Siege.

Rainbow Six Mobile offers access to a bunch of maps, including some that will be familiar to fans of the franchise. There are more than 20 operators to choose from and Ubisoft promises it&#39;ll be adding more content with each new season.
The company is rolling the game out early in some parts of the world. It&#39;s already playable in Poland, France, Canada and parts of Latin America.

What happened to iRobot can happen to anyone,"The company which popularized robot vacuum cleaners around the world has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. iRobot, makers of the Roomba, has been synonymous with the category since its inception, but its star had dulled in recent years. The company plans to sell its assets to its primary supplier, China’s Picea Robotics, in the hope of maintaining its business.Everyone’s got a strident opinion as to why iRobot fell from grace. The rugged individualists blame limp regulators on both sides of the pond (and their hatred for big tech) for blocking Amazon’s attempted purchase in 2023. Those on the hardware side of the fence say iRobot’s refusal to embrace LiDAR for navigation until this year left it behind rivals.Then there’s the geopolitical experts, who can point at China’s industrial policy, subsidies and favorable regulatory environment compared to the US approach. After all, iRobot’s US gear is made in Vietnam, which is now subject to a 46 percent import levy. As BBC News reported, that added around $23 million to iRobot’s costs and increased the price of its hardware.The real answer is that iRobot’s demise was caused by a perfect storm of all these factors piling on to the company. More importantly, iRobot’s situation isn’t any way unique, and should serve as a warning to every major American technology brand. It’s also a lesson in why companies need to deal with existential threats when they have the time and cash to do so. For instance, once iRobot perfected the concept for the Roomba, it wasn’t long before the first copies burst onto the scene. iRobot had the brand and the know-how, but that only goes so far against well-motivated copycats. Think about the first Samsung Android handsets, and how quickly they went from iPhone imitations to class-defining devices of their own — and how hard Apple fought in court to prevent it.Even before this year’s tariffs, iRobot struggled to compete on price in a manner we’ve seen in other fields. Remember Fitbit before Google purchased it, happily selling $80 fitness trackers for years until Xiaomi swiped the low-end part of its business for itself. Even if the early MiBands weren’t very good, you could buy three for the price of a single Fitbit Charge. Yes, the argument around quality and reliability is important, but it’s often not as loud or compelling as a competing product sold for a fraction of the price.iRobot should have either made more of an effort to offer a dirt-cheap model to undercut its rivals, or more likely pull out of the low end altogether. Earlier today, I checked out local retail listings for Roombas and its nearest competitors. Next to one another were the Roomba 405 Combo with Dock and the Roborock Q7 L5+ — both capable of vacuuming and mopping your floor. The former is currently on sale for $400 direct from iRobot, while the latter is currently selling for $220. I’m sure plenty of buyers would have seen the price difference and opted for the cheaper model.I’m not going to throw too many Told You So’s over iRobot’s fence for not embracing LiDAR sooner. Its omission was a mistake, but you could see why it was shy about abandoning its existing setup. But the company had forgotten one key mantra about the tech world, Andy Grove’s maxim that “only the paranoid survive.” Even the fanciest, highest-end Roombas of the last five years felt a generation behind rival products.And, at the risk of sounding like a marketing guru, it was never clear what iRobot, or Roomba, stood for. When companies flooded the market with cheaper models, iRobot needed to make it clear what it meant when you bought a Roomba over a generic model. What did, and could, it offer beyond the name and history that made it stand out against cheaper competitors? Companies like Apple and Dyson command a premium, but you almost always know what you’re getting for your money.All I can say is that it’s good that there isn’t another American company presently in a similar position. I certainly can’t think of a controversial US company that builds things with wheels that has historically rejected LiDAR for its autonomous services. One that has a brand that doesn’t stand for much, or has its identity tied too closely to the identity of its CEO. One that is staring down the barrel at a raft of better equipped and often cheaper Chinese alternatives. Because that company could surely be looking at a similar fate a decade or so down the road.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/what-happened-to-irobot-can-happen-to-anyone-164500625.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2FY3JvcD0xNjAwJTJDMTAyOCUyQzAlMkMwJnF1YWxpdHk9ODUmZm9ybWF0PWpwZyZyZXNpemU9MTYwMCUyQzEwMjgmaW1hZ2VfdXJpPWh0dHAlM0ElMkYlMkZvLmFvbGNkbi5jb20lMkZoc3MlMkZzdG9yYWdlJTJGbWlkYXMlMkZjZjViNWIyZTVmMjVlY2QxYmU1MjFiMzQwZjE5OGFlMyUyRjIwNjcxNzAwOCUyRlJvb21.jpeg&resize=1400%2C899&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=9b2c8fe7145553c263e711df6ce357f96a96b427,https://www.engadget.com/home/what-happened-to-irobot-can-happen-to-anyone-164500625.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-16T16:45:00Z,11,Tech
Demystifying risk in AI,"
		
					  
						




Given the facts about the importance of Artificial Intelligence, for several months, I have been delving into this topic, but with caution, seeking to understand the key point of how we can protect applications based on Gen AI.



We are living in times when AI has been the central theme in all areas that can provide benefits to organizations and end users. In addition to adding benefits to protection and anticipation in detecting cyber threats, whether with threat intelligence, incident response and EDR, SOAR solutions, etc.



However, the question we must ask is how much we are looking at the risks of this emerging technology. As AI gains traction through the use of solutions like ChatGPT, Claude.ai, Meta.ai, Copilot, Gemini, Grok, among other SaaS-based solutions, it is a fact that AI is invading and taking over our routine. Those who do not adapt to this technology may be considered a piece off the board.



Whether it’s to record meetings and create automated summaries with Hynote.ai, or to prepare a Cyber Risk Management plan, we really have to recognize the speed and agility that AI provides to daily tasks. We already see that in some companies, where an employee decides to change jobs, the position may no longer be replaced, and the organization considers conducting studies evaluating the feasibility of replacing certain tasks with AI.



The importance of understanding the risks behind AI



Here comes a point of concern that perhaps some professionals are not noticing. Are we being dominated by AI? Perhaps the answer may be “Yes,” “No” or “Maybe.” However, it will depend on the degree of visibility we have of this technology; the reality is that there is a danger behind it, and so our job is to know how to prepare to remediate such risks.



Should we presume where we should fit professionally and how we should prepare to maintain our employability? Given that risks of hallucinations are still feasible and occur in AI solutions, the answer to a given question may not be accurate, as the existing methods behind diffusion models used in AI training utilize code generation techniques such as “transformers” in LLMs used by most AI tools like ChatGPT, Gemini and Claude. For now, they still have limitations to validate a certain piece of data before providing the answer to the question that was entered by the requester (end user, API, etc.).



This means and indicates that it is still necessary to consider the human factor to evaluate certain responses before providing a decision that may involve relevant decision-making in the corporate and human context, such as the result of an analysis of a medical diagnosis still requires an evaluation by a specialist, or in the case of a quantitative risk assessment of a critical system. In fact, it is a point to think about!



Another important question to be asked is “how far should we limit and trust an AI solution?” Certainly, as mentioned above, many results can be positive, but remembering that every organization should think and maintain caution with privacy, bias, fairness and transparency risks through the data provided, among other points, which have raised the attention of information security professionals.



Basically, the execution process of an AI model is composed of 3 phases:




The data that is inserted in a request.



This data is evaluated by a training model that involves an entire architecture.



The result of the information that will be delivered




From an information security point of view. That is the point that we, information security professionals, must judge in the scope of evaluation from the perspective of data security.



In the market, there are already frameworks such as NIST RMF AI, SAIF Google, ISO 42001, AI Control Matrix (AICM) and AI Model Risk Management Framework from Cloud Security Alliance (CSA), in addition to MITRE ATLAS for the Threat Intelligence line and OWASP Top 10 LLMs for security in AI application development, which presents the main known vulnerabilities in the AI/ML field, which I intend to explore in another article.



I have particularly been studying NIST RMF AI and the AI Model Risk Management Framework from CSA, and in my view, they are effective in helping to map and add AI/ML solutions to the scope of the organization’s Cyber Risk Management program. These frameworks help to understand and map the AI applications used, address risks, impacts and damages that can occur with the use of this technology in the corporate context.



About the use of NIST AI RMF and AI Control Matrix (AICM) Frameworks



Making an agenda about the most popular frameworks, NIST AI RMF 1.0 focuses on looking at the group of people, organization and the ecosystem involved. In which they are divided into phases of




Govern (cultivates a risk culture)



Map (context of identified risk and asset classification)



Measure (identifies, assesses and mitigates risk)



Manage (risks are prioritized according to impact)




This model allows integration with NIST CSF for the lens of cybersecurity controls. The most interesting thing about this is that the framework is free.



Another model that I cannot fail to mention is the AI Control Matrix (AICM), which contains 243 control objectives divided into 18 security domains and allows evaluating all security pillars of an AI solution, specifically in a cloud environment.



AICM is integrated with AI-CAIQ, which covers frameworks including BSI AIC4 Catalog, NIST AI RMF and ISO 42001. Any robust AI solution needs large processing and energy, which can only be found in data centers. For this reason, we have seen large investments by big techs in the expansion of new data centers in all regions.



Therefore, deeply understanding cloud concepts and shared responsibilities is fundamental to implement an AI solution with precision, securely and that satisfies the business, leveraging the organization’s capacity against competition.



As a result, I have been doing some research on GenAI and especially studying these frameworks. In view of this, characterizing and visualizing the great challenge for us, cybersecurity professionals, is to establish the relevance of the connection between the teams involved in an AI project. Therefore, the connection is a priority for the project’s success and, therefore, we should not neglect the involvement of the areas of governance, cyber risk, ethics, regulatory and compliance, cybersecurity, data scientists, AI and ML developers, human Resources and infrastructure and IT operations.



Cybersecurity professionals need to be trained



Another great challenge, which I emphasize, is that cybersecurity professionals need to be trained in this AI/ML technology, understanding the technical aspects of architecture, training models used, techniques such as RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) that propose improvements in the model, and the application of the cybersecurity strategy to be judged. The eyes of the CISO and the cybersecurity team and other fronts involved must look at the importance of controls within these areas:




Data



Infrastructure



Model



Application



Assurance



Governance




Looking at the shared responsibility perspective in cloud



Another factor to be considered in scope: I reinforce the shared responsibility of AI applications in a cloud environment. The security principles of GenAI models and respective applications must consider how the AI application model will run.



Here, I highlight some crucial points to establish shared responsibilities in the cloud:




GenAI as an application (Public, SaaS)



GenAI as a platform (IaaS or PaaS)



Build your own AI application (IaaS, on premises).




In this model, with the help of the frameworks mentioned above, it will be possible to map, order and manage risks in the AI strategy adopted regarding access control for data and training models, data management and training, prompt controls, model development, model inference, model monitoring and infrastructure.



Thinking outside the box



Finally, the key point I wish to awaken readers in this article is to lead them to think about how we cybersecurity professionals are observing the risks and impacts in our environment, and how to prepare to evaluate such GenAI solutions in our realistic world.



I have particularly been exploring some of these known models in a cloud environment (SaaS), but I have been having a lot of fun with the Anthropic solution (claude.ai). In this model, it is possible to build robust solutions with code; you just have to be creative. As an example, I requested that it create a complete Cyber Risk Management (GRC) solution and suggested comparing it with some solutions on the market and meet best practices such as PCI-DSS, NIST, CRI, ISO 27001, etc. So that the solution created the entire back-end, only missing the front-end creation. A project that could take months can be reduced to a few months or weeks, depending on the investment and effort of the workforce involved.



Certifications that can add value to a career



In conclusion, as I had the opportunity to participate as a contributor to the review program for the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) recently launched new certification, Trusted AI Safety Expert (TAISE). I definitely recommend it for those who are interested in understanding and exploring the architecture and main protection mechanisms in AI/ML solutions.



However, taking into account other certifications in this area, I have also been exploring and recommending ISACA’s AAISM certification material, which in turn is very interesting from the point of view of risk governance and security in AI/ML. Nevertheless, TAISE brings a more comprehensive root in the technical scope that also incorporates risk management and governance in cloud environments, which is the real world. AI needs large processing and the ideal environment to run is the cloud.



However, both complement each other and it is up to the professional to evaluate the best alternative and direction to follow. As the wise proverb says: “Do not abandon wisdom and knowledge, and it will guard you; love it, and it will protect you.”

Dead Island 3 is in development and will reportedly come out in 2028,"The zombie-decapitating sim Dead Island 3 is still being developed, according to financial documents from Dambuster Studios that were published on X and reported on by Video Games Chronicle. These documents suggest a 2028 release date, so that&#39;s something to look forward to.

The paperwork says the development is &#34;moving at pace&#34; and that &#34;parts of the game are now in early production.&#34; These parts reportedly include feature design, world design, narrative and character design.
We already knew this game was in development, as Dambuster posted on Steam earlier this year that &#34;the outbreak is far from over.&#34; The idea of Dead Island 3 makes a whole lot of sense, given the success of the second one. The company has sold over 4 million copies of the game since 2023.

It&#39;s also worth noting that a 2028 release date would put five years between the two sequels. That&#39;s a long time for something like Assassin&#39;s Creed, but nothing for the Dead Island franchise. Dead Island 2 was first announced in 2014, so development took nearly a decade.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/dead-island-3-is-in-development-and-will-reportedly-come-out-in-2028-162522680.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2Fb866db60-da9b-11f0-aa5d-7d28fda59d61&resize=1400%2C932&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=10bd234d0ec54b21198df27067822177c24ca893,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/dead-island-3-is-in-development-and-will-reportedly-come-out-in-2028-162522680.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-16T16:25:23Z,2,Tech

Instagram launches a Fire TV app for Reels,"Have you ever just wished you could watch Instagram Reels right on a TV? Maybe? Well, if so, you&#39;re in luck. Meta has launched an Instagram app exclusively on Fire TV. It will be solely for &#34;short-form video content,&#34; so Reels. TikTok launched an app on Fire TV in 2020 before rolling it out to other platforms. 
Instagram and Fire TV users can download the former through Amazon&#39;s App Store. It can either link to an existing account or have a separate account just for TV. The app can hold up to five different Instagram accounts — and time spent factors into any limits on teen accounts. 
&#34;Our mission is to get you to the world’s best content fast, and we’re thrilled to welcome Instagram to Fire TV,&#34; Fire TV vice president, Aidan Marcuss, said in a statement. &#34;We’re committed to keep pushing the boundaries of entertainment on customers&#39; biggest screens — the Instagram team has built an awesome experience, and we’re excited to be the first place to offer it. We can’t wait to see what customers think.&#34;
For now, Reels are separated into different channels, such as sports highlights or hidden travel gems. Reels also play automatically, so you don&#39;t have to swipe between content on the screen. According to Meta, the app is still being tested, so these formats might change in the future. 
Instagram users in the US can now get the TV app on Amazon&#39;s Fire TV Stick HD, 4K Plus and 4K Max (first and second generation). It&#39;s also available on the Fire RV 2-Series, 4-Series, and Omni QLED Series. However, Meta says that the Instagram App for TV should be available on more devices and in other countries after this initial testing round.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/instagram-launches-a-fire-tv-app-for-reels-160003710.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F6e02d2f0-da90-11f0-8c7d-5587e4d39d1b&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=bd7f1233d3927e2e9843bba0c984dc36f86f2af7,https://www.engadget.com/social-media/instagram-launches-a-fire-tv-app-for-reels-160003710.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-16T16:00:03Z,7,Tech

Amazon is set to lay off 370 workers at its European HQ,"Amazon is set to fire 370 people at its European headquarters in Luxembourg in the coming weeks, as Bloomberg reports. That accounts for about 8.5 percent of the workforce. Amazon initially planned to reduce its headcount there by 470, but under European Union law, companies have to negotiate layoffs with employee reps and, in some cases, governments.Amazon reportedly told employees at the European HQ in a memo the layoffs are &#34;adjustments that reflect business needs and local strategies.&#34; The company claims to be going &#34;well beyond industry benchmarks&#34; in Luxembourg with regards to the severance packages it&#39;s offering.An Amazon employee said it would be difficult for hundreds of people who are all going into the job market at the same time to find employment elsewhere in the country. Affected employees who moved from other countries to work for Amazon will have to leave if they don&#39;t land another job in Luxembourg within three months. After the layoffs, Amazon is still expected to be the fifth-largest employer in Luxembourg, which has a population of 680,000. One employee told Bloomberg that the cuts would primarily affect software developers amid a push in the tech industry for AI to take on more coding tasks. Amazon said in October it would cut 14,000 jobs from its global workforce amid its deepening embrace of AI. It was reported that same month that the company&#39;s plans to ramp up its robotics operations could put around half a million jobs in the US at risk.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/amazon-is-set-to-lay-off-370-workers-at-its-european-hq-154037845.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2F2025-12%2F38ddc844-5693-47e3-9e41-cfb90355c42c&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=89c59518654eac82508bdf44da7031835d27963b,https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/amazon-is-set-to-lay-off-370-workers-at-its-european-hq-154037845.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-16T15:40:37Z,11,Tech

PayPal applies to become a bank under Trump's looser financial rules,"PayPal is the latest company looking to become a bank in the US. On Monday, the company announced it had submitted applications for PayPal Bank to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Utah Department of Financial Institutions (UDFI). PayPal is already a bank in Europe, based in Luxembourg. 
According to PayPal, it has provided &#34;over $30 billion in loans and working capital&#34; for more than 420,000 business accounts globally. PayPal puts its focus on small businesses in pitching the need for a US bank. &#34;Securing capital remains a significant hurdle for small businesses striving to grow and scale,&#34; Alex Chriss, president and CEO of PayPal, said in a release. &#34;Establishing PayPal Bank will strengthen our business and improve our efficiency, enabling us to better support small business growth and economic opportunities across the US.&#34; 
PayPal also plans to provide &#34;interest-bearing saving accounts&#34; as a bank. If approved, it would be chartered in Utah. 
Applications to become a bank have popped up left and right this year, with approval odds increasing under the Trump administration. On Friday, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) announced that five cryptocurrency companies, including BitGo, Circle and Ripple, received conditional approval to become federally charted trust banks.  
&#34;New entrants into the federal banking sector are good for consumers, the banking industry and the economy,&#34; the OCC&#39;s comptroller Jonathan V. Gould stated in the announcement. &#34;They provide access to new products, services and sources of credit to consumers, and ensure a dynamic, competitive and diverse banking system.&#34;
Other companies such as Nissan and Sony have also submitted applications to form a bank. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/paypal-applies-to-become-a-bank-under-trumps-looser-financial-rules-143025772.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-08%2Fb30294f0-7954-11f0-b57d-ff822be1906f&resize=1400%2C875&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=e55a52d5be4b8891c59a658045defad92c73d870,https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/paypal-applies-to-become-a-bank-under-trumps-looser-financial-rules-143025772.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-16T14:30:25Z,7,Tech

Avatar Fire and Ash review: Maybe it's time to sunset Pandora,"No matter what you think of James Cameron&#39;s Avatar movies, their technical ambitions are undeniable. Cameron developed his own camera system to shoot the first Avatar in 3D, but since most of the actors were digitally captured, he also had the freedom to construct scenes with a virtual camera after they were physically shot. For Avatar: The Way of Water, which arrived a whopping 13 years after the first film, Cameron also leaned into high frame rate footage and new ways of modeling natural fluid dynamics. Even though the third entry, Avatar: Fire and Ash, is coming just a few years after the last sequel, I still expected Cameron to deliver some sort of new feat to wow audiences. He could have found a smoother way to employ high frame rate footage, so the film wasn&#39;t jarringly shifting between traditional 24 fps scenes and smoother 48 fps action shots. Maybe we&#39;d see more natural interactions between live actors and virtual characters and environments (it sure is hard to beat Edie Falco suited up in a wicked exoskeleton in the last film, though). Instead, Avatar: Fire and Ash is just another Avatar film — it doesn&#39;t push any boundaries, narratively or technically. And without any technical achievements to lean on, the narrative issues inherent with Avatar become all the more glaring. It&#39;s still basically a story that places a clueless white dude in the middle of a fight between indigenous and colonialist powers. (Improbably, he&#39;s crowned one of the Na&#39;vi&#39;s best warriors!). The script from Cameron and his co-writers (Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver, continuing their work from The Way of Water) often hits identical beats to a low-rent CW show. And perhaps worst of all, the stakes of the story haven&#39;t really changed much. Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) and his family are still fighting off the militarized Resource Development Association (RDA), Col. Quaritch still holds a grudge from being killed (twice now!) and from the Sullies raising his Tarzan-like son, Spider (Jack Champion).There’s an attempt to cast the Na’vi in a new light with the villainous Ash People, who spend their days attacking and stealing from other tribes. While most Na’vi people work cooperatively with other clans and share their reverence for Eywa, the collective consciousness of Pandora, the Ash People resent it for not saving their villages from natural disasters. Despite a deliciously evil performance by Oona Chaplin (Charlie Chaplin&#39;s grandaughter!) as Varang, the Ash People don&#39;t amount to much more than &#34;evil Na&#39;vi.&#34; When they inevitably work together with humans to attack other Na’vi, it doesn’t feel surprising in the least. Honestly, it’s a tad insulting.Avatar: Fire and Ash20th. Century StudiosPerhaps we&#39;ve been spoiled by Cameron&#39;s last few films, but Avatar: Fire and Ash ultimately feels like more of the same. Even its massive final battle feels like a retread, since it’s set in the same ocean environment as The Way of Water and is once again focused on protecting psychic alien whales from humans. Cameron does let his action chops shine throughout the film, but after a certain point, trying to enjoy those sequences is like trying to eat a family-sized carton of ice cream by yourself. You’ll enjoy it for a little while, but eventually you’re  left with a massive headache and sugar hangover.It’s clear that James Cameron has built the Avatar franchise to explore everything he loves: Stories about protecting the environment, fighting against capitalist excess and kicking tons of ass. Parts of Avatar 4 have already been shot, and that film is expected to arrive in 2029. But I’m hoping the 71-year-old filmmaker eventually finds his way out of Pandora. He’s co-directing the Billie Eilish concert film, Hit Me Hard and Soft: The Tour, so that’s a start. But I’m eager to see what other new worlds he can dream up.

Mercedes-Benz CLA first drive: Head of the EV class,"This one&#39;s been a long time coming. Mercedes-Benz has been researching, refining and even reshaping the car that would ultimately be the CLA for years now, teasing us with technical briefings and even showing off a sultry crimson concept car a full two years ago.That was the Concept CLA, and while the production CLA you see here doesn&#39;t look quite that good, it is a fine-looking little electric sedan. More importantly, it goes as far as you&#39;d think its slippery, 0.21-coefficient-of-drag body would carry it: up to 374 miles on a charge.With a $47,250 starting price, is this electric CLA the complete package? After spending a day behind the wheel of one, I think it might just be. Higher density2026 Mercedes-Benz CLA 250+ EQTim Stevens for EngadgetThe CLA has long been Mercedes-Benz&#39;s most attainable sedan, a machine for those wanting something fun and stylish that offers a taste of the M-B lifestyle without breaking the bank.Attainability is still a big focus of this newly rebooted CLA, which serves as the debut venue for the company&#39;s latest generation of electrification. While most luxury auto makers would have you swing for their top-tier models to get the newest tech, Mercedes is actually bringing it to the lower end first. The new CLA is built around a new battery pack that offers 20 percent more energy density than the company&#39;s previous EVs. There&#39;s a big boost in efficiency, too. Where the EQS, the company&#39;s current range meister, does up to 390 miles on a charge from roughly 110 kilowatt-hours, the CLA manages 374 miles from just 85. It&#39;s a much smaller car, sure, and lighter too at about 4,500 pounds versus 5,500 and up for the EQS, but there are bigger efficiencies at play here thanks to advanced motors and the aforementioned aerodynamics.The CLA’s  0.21 coefficient of drag slots it right in between the 0.20 rating for the EQS sedan and 0.22 for the EQE. Crucially, though, despite being just as slippery as those cars, Mercedes-Benz&#39;s designers also managed to make the CLS stylish, a big step up from the efficient but amorphous profiles of its previous EVs. That aerodynamic efficiency is a big part of what delivers the 374-mile range for the single-motor CLA 250+ with EQ Technology model, the formal and long-winded designation for what I drove. It delivers 268 horsepower through the rear wheels. Those wanting a bit more oomph can step up to the 349-hp, dual-motor, all-wheel-drive 350 4MATIC model. That extra power and low-grip surety costs an extra $2,550, but the bigger penalty is range: the dual-motor model maxes out at 312 miles on a charge. (There is a hybrid version of the new CLA coming as well, but we&#39;ll cover that on its own later.)When it comes to charging, the new CLA impresses there, too. Charging at up to 320 kilowatts via the company&#39;s first NACS plug, the CLA adds a whopping 200 miles of range in 10 minutes. Weirdly, the car also has a separate, older-style J1772 plug for slower, level-two charging.Accessible, not basicThe interior displays of the 2026 Mercedes-Benz CLA 250+ EQTim Stevens for EngadgetAs a more attainable machine, you wouldn&#39;t necessarily expect the CLA to be completely loaded with features. Still, tick enough boxes and you can definitely get it there. While it doesn&#39;t have the luscious, curving Hyperscreen display as the EQS, it does offer a similar experience called Superscreen. You can get up to three displays spread across the dashboard: a 10.25-inch gauge cluster on the left, a 14-inch touchscreen in the center and an optional third display (also 14 inches) on the right for the passenger to play Angry Birds or stream videos. If, for some reason, they wouldn&#39;t rather just look at their phone.All those displays run the latest version of the MBUX user interface, similar to what we&#39;ve seen in the company&#39;s other EVs, but it’s a bit simpler and easier to use here. That&#39;s backed by a wholly new system-level operating system called MB.OS running on NVIDIA silicon, also making its debut on the CLA. Mercedes says this not only has far more capability but can also be more comprehensively updated via the car&#39;s 5G connection. One of the features in the latest Mercedes software is baked-in AI. Say &#34;Hey, Mercedes,&#34; and you can not only change just about any setting in the car, but also engage in any number of inane conversations. I asked for a weather update for my next trip to Chicago, the latest releases from a few of my forgotten bands and even got an explanation of why the lyrics in the song &#34;Water&#39;s Edge&#34; by Seven Mary Three are so very creepy. (Don&#39;t go down there, friends.)It&#39;s all reasonably snappy and quite useful, but not perfect. When I said &#34;I&#39;m hungry,&#34; I got a quick listing of restaurants and offers for quick routing. When I said, &#34;I need a hospital,&#34; the system, flummoxed, just stopped talking to me. Thankfully, I did not need a hospital. I was actually feeling pretty okay. That extensive software upgradability is also opening the door to a new era of car upgrades. Yes, the automotive DLC era is here, and you can pay extra to unlock additional active features like automated parking, navigation, a dashcam function and whatever else Mercedes-Benz&#39;s product planners can dream up in the future. Hopefully, there&#39;s no horse armor involved.We&#39;ll see how that shakes out, but my only real complaint about the interior was that it felt a bit cramped. It&#39;s a sedan on the small side, sure, but the layout feels a bit claustrophobic. That dashboard with all the displays is situated nearly vertically, as are the sides of the center console. Sitting in the passenger seat felt like being tucked in a box.Mind you, it was a very comfortable box, well-upholstered and featuring a lovely interior trim made of recycled paper, grooved to give the effect of a Zen garden. Headroom up front is generous and actually isn&#39;t too bad in the rear, but ducking under that sweeping roofline to get into the back seats requires a bit of flexibility.Drive time2026 Mercedes-Benz CLA 250+ EQTim Stevens for EngadgetDespite being the slowest electric CLA, this little sedan gets off the line quickly. A 6.6-second 0-to-60 time under-sells the feeling of instant acceleration and throttle response that make EVs so very compelling. You only start to feel the CLA&#39;s relative lack of horsepower at higher speeds, but even there, it&#39;s hardly lacking.That made it a blast to scoot from light to light as I was escaping from San Francisco, but it was much more fun in the foothills of Mt. Tamalpais. The CLA&#39;s steering is light yet has good feedback. I could really feel the road beneath the front tires, making for a more engaging machine than I was expecting.That battery pack in the floor keeps body roll in check, but a positively pliant suspension makes for a relaxed affair. The CLA did a great job of soaking up the countless imperfections in and around San Francisco, making for an extremely comfortable commuter, if one that felt a bit floaty at times.It&#39;ll be a safe commuter, too. The car is festooned with sensors, including 10 cameras of various resolutions and focal lengths, five radar sensors firing in every direction and 12 ultrasonic sensors. You&#39;ll need to pay extra for the digital keys to unlock their full functionality, though, like advanced lane-keeping and automated lane changes. There&#39;s even an advanced, point-to-point driver assistance system coming called MB.DRIVE Assist Pro that&#39;ll let the car handle most of the steering — even on secondary roads. More details on that to come. For now, the car did great at managing itself on the highway, changing lanes with enough initiative to get through commuter traffic without issue, and not only bringing itself to a complete stop in traffic, but resuming again as soon as the cars ahead moved.It even delivered good efficiency. I saw 3.9 miles per kWh, which would equate to a theoretical 331 miles from the 85 kWh battery pack. That&#39;s despite my driving with a good amount of enthusiasm and a heavy right foot. Edmunds, driving more conservatively, got 434 miles from a single charge,Wrap-up2026 Mercedes-Benz CLA 250+ EQTim Stevens for EngadgetSo the CLA looks great, drives well, has plenty of range and again, starting at $47,250, feels well-priced. Yes, you&#39;ll need to pay extra if you want to get all the toys, like the epic Dolby Atmos-capable Burmester sound system or the lovely Natural Fiber Zen interior trim. But when I ticked all the boxes I wanted, I still came out under $60,000. That put me about $5,000 below the base price of the company&#39;s next-bigger EV, the EQE.The CLA really is a big step forward on the EV front, and it’s a car that&#39;s hard to fault.

Fallout Season 2 review: Viva New Vegas,"The follow-up to a successful debut is often harder to make than the first, and that goes double when the inspiration for a show comes from the most beloved installment of the underlying franchise. That&#39;s precisely the challenge Fallout season 2 is facing as the TV series shifts its stage to the irradiated lights of New Vegas when the series returns on December 16 at 9PM ET/6PM PT on Prime Video. However, while other video game adaptations like The Last of Us suffered from a bit of a sophomore slump, Fallout continues to get more crass, vulgar and abrasive in the most entertaining ways. Editor&#39;s note: We were provided the first six of eight episodes of Fallout season 2 for this review, so if the ending of this season misses its landing, blame The Enclave. Season two picks up directly after the first as Lucy (played by Ella Purnelle) and The Ghoul (Walton Goggins) make their way across the wasteland in pursuit of Lucy&#39;s father. And right away, we&#39;re instantly reminded of the magnetic chemistry between our leading lady vault dweller and her endearing naivete and our post-apocalyptic cowboy afflicted with dark pragmatism from having simply lived through too much. This simple combo not only often provides the setup for Lucy&#39;s signature catchphrase — which is both quaint and refreshing — it also sets the stage for some interesting plot points. Just hearing The Ghoul say things like &#34;Do more drugs&#34; with Goggin&#39;s classic drawl and without a hint of irony is a real treat. There&#39;s never a dull moment when Lucy and The Ghoul are traveling together. Prime VideoOne of the potential pitfalls of a second season though, is an expanded storyline. That&#39;s because unlike the Fallout games where you get to steer the action, we&#39;re just here for the ride as we flip between Lucy&#39;s search for her father, the existential crises facing multiple vaults and an expanded role for Maximus (Aaron Moten) as he suddenly finds himself near the top of the Brotherhood of Steel&#39;s org chart. But somehow, the showrunners have managed to make each branching path just as engaging as the others. There were hints of his range in the first season, but Moises Arias shines as Lucy&#39;s brother Norm as the leader of a new crew (I&#39;m trying to keep this review as spoiler-free as possible) while Annabel O&#39;Hagan as Overseer Harper does a fantastic job of switching between being out of her depth and completely unhinged at a moment&#39;s notice. In season two, it feels like Aaron Moten&#39;s Maximus is so close to figuring out what kind of soldier he wants to be. Prime VideoThe one path that still feels like it hasn&#39;t fully hit its stride is Maximus&#39;, due in large part to the fact that the character&#39;s actions often feel like they are influenced more by circumstance than personal agency. In some ways, it&#39;s the continuation of someone defining their own morality, which rarely feels as convincing or driven as someone with a plan. But there&#39;s still intrigue there too.Meanwhile, for fans of the games, the number of easter eggs and callbacks is downright delightful. The set design and cinematography make the wasteland a character in its own right, even if the last thing I want to see is someone eat flea soup. We&#39;re also treated to an ever-growing zoography of nuclear critters such as rad scorpions, all sorts of mutants and more, along with appearances from iconic characters like everyone&#39;s favorite cowboy-coded security robot. And I appreciate how the show spends a little extra time to go over the myriad of factions (like The Legion and the NCR), which pays homage to the core series while functioning as an interesting side quest at the same time. With Overseer Harper at the helm, there&#39;s no telling what will happen to Vault 32. Prime VideoWith this much going on, it would be easy for a series to become overburdened. But the pacing isn&#39;t labored, because while the show doesn&#39;t actually get to New Vegas until episode four, the journey there was so entertaining that I didn&#39;t mind. Perhaps most importantly, even though it would be impossible to completely recreate New Vegas on TV (since you can’t choose your own adventure here like you can in the game), it really feels like Fallout&#39;s showrunners have nailed the balance between respecting the source material and tweaking the story to fit a different medium. That&#39;s a big credit to the franchise, especially coming from a genre that often gets maligned for a lack of depth or nuance. But it&#39;s also a tribute to this series, which continues to be a prime example of how to make the jump from pixels to TV screens look gook. And after seeing The Last of Us stumble a bit during its second cour, I might even go so far as to say that Fallout is the best live-action video game crossover to date. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/fallout-season-2-review-viva-new-vegas-140000678.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2FFalloutS2TBimage8_3000.jpg&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=3302cdc30cdadd39b4db73ef8f3c05def6ff567a,https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/fallout-season-2-review-viva-new-vegas-140000678.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-16T14:00:00Z,8,Tech
China approves two level-3 autonomous EVs,"China has taken another step forward in the self-driving car market. The country&#39;s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) has made its first approval for cars with level-3 autonomous driving capabilities. The two electric sedans come from state-owned automakers Changan Auto and BAIC Motor.
The US National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) defines level-3 driving as &#34;the system handles all aspects of the driving task while you, as the driver, are available to take over driving if requested. If the system can no longer operate and prompts the driver, the driver must be available to resume all aspects of the driving task.&#34;
According to a translation of MIIT&#39;s announcement, the Changan vehicle can drive autonomously in single lanes of both highways and urban expressways in traffic congestion. It is allowed solely in certain areas of  Chongqing at a maximum speed of 50 km/h (31 mph). The BAIC electric sedan can also function autonomously on the same roads, but only in areas of Beijing at a maximum speed of 80 km/h (50 mph). 
&#34;The team strictly followed the standards and procedures to conduct preliminary review, selection, testing, and safety assessments,&#34; MIIT stated. &#34;Both automotive companies have completed and passed the product testing and safety assessments as required.&#34; They didn&#39;t present a timeline for when the models would become available.

"The mistold story of a software failure that grounded 6,000 jets","
		
					  
						




“You should fly.  It’s safer.”



It’s a fact. The odds are in your favor when compared to auto travel.  It’s not even close, we often remind the flight-fearing traveler.



Yet two of the smartest people I have known refuse to fly despite agreeing with this statistic. I think of them every time I board a flight.  It was no different when I returned from vacation on a JetBlue flight that retraced some of the northbound path taken by a JetBlue flight some weeks earlier.



The flight in question was likely also filled with vacationers, an Airbus A320 journeying from Cancún International Airport in Mexico to Newark Liberty International Airport on October 30, 2025. As reported the next day in the New York Times, passengers aboard Flight 1230 were likely dozing off two and a half hours into the flight from the Mexican resort when they were jolted to attention by a sudden drop in altitude. When the unwanted acrobatic maneuver was over, 15 or more passengers involuntarily extended their vacations at hospitals in Tampa, where the JetBlue pilots managed a successful emergency landing.



JetBlue representatives said the plane was taken out of service for inspection.



There are occasional commercial aviation mishaps, along with the rare disaster. For the flying public, reports of these mishaps are regular enough that a news story like this one can be safely tucked away until a broader pattern emerges. Understandably, had that been the end of the story, especially considering that it’s been Boeing planes subject to unwanted excitement of this variety since the 737 Max woes began. The plane involved in this JetBlue flight, as well as the one where I now occupied seat 23A, was an Airbus, thought to be less subject to what an FAA Expert Panel Report in February 2024 called “gaps in Boeing’s safety journey.”



That’s this plane, I thought to myself. What did the ensuing investigation uncover? Mechanical failure?  Software, perhaps even malware (though very unlikely)?



The “cause”



The Times dutifully reported the results of that investigation in a story they ran on November 28, 2025, the same day of my return flight to JFK. The story, adapted in part from an Airbus press release, opened with:



The European airplane maker said a recent incident had shown that “intense solar radiation may corrupt data critical to the functioning of flight controls.”



The impact on the Airbus A320 fleet and the airlines that have deployed them would be widespread.  Potentially, 6,000 planes could be affected, with some requiring hardware changes, The Times reported after studying the extent to which the A320 has been chosen by airlines worldwide. 



That’s a major impact, I thought. And then I read,



In most cases, the issue can be addressed relatively quickly by reverting to a previous software version.



Hold on.



“Single event upset”



So, how often is this radiation impact occurring?  What’s the underlying physics? 



It turns out that there’s a history of science story to be told.  Nobel Prize winner Victor Hess discovered the existence of cosmic rays by measuring radiation levels at higher altitudes during balloon flights. That was before World War I. By the 1960s, it was a concern for crew health in the space program. A 1975 paper identified a satellite anomaly as a “single-event upset” (SEU) caused by radiation, and by 1979, it was understood that electronics could be disrupted at sea level.



By 1990, the FAA acknowledged that there was a risk to air travelers. The Airbus A320, a fly-by-wire aircraft with greater reliance on computers, was designed during a time when this phenomenon was well understood in the aeronautical engineering community.



As software engineers at the time would have understood, addressing SEUs would require hardware and software features. ECC memory, for instance.  Sanity checks, too, in case a flipped bit would produce wildly out-of-range instructions.



Features.  So why would rolling back to an earlier version of software be the remedy for the A320 late in 2025?  Wouldn’t features to address SEU from radiation in the current release also be present in earlier releases?  Or perhaps was there some new, innovative way to address SEU that would supersede the approaches taken in earlier releases?



Software life cycle management fundamentals



At this point, the software quality engineer in me perked up. Somehow, the entire radiation part of the story seemed curiously irrelevant.



I was not to be the only one asking questions.



Tony Fernandez is the founder of AirAsia Aviation Group. AirAsia’s current operations include a significant number of Airbus jets, and it has orders for almost 400 more Airbus aircraft. Fernandez expressed his concerns in a recent interview.



“It seems a bit bizarre; it is something it [Airbus] has to look at, it’s obvious it wasn’t tested,” Fernandez told South China Morning Post. Fernandez speculated that Airbus might be stressed by commitments to meet its current goal of producing 820 planes in 2025.



Apart from the eye-catching radiation storyline, the surface cause was described as a problem in the Elevator Aileron Computer (ELAC 2) software, which manages the aircraft’s pitch and roll by sending commands from the pilot’s side-stick to elevators at its rear. The software rollback involved restoring a version dubbed “L103,” replacing “L104.” Thales, developer of the ELAC hardware, told Reuters that the software involved was not its responsibility.



The sudden nose-down movement experienced by the JetBlue passengers bound for Newark could also affect a wide variety of Airbus models, not only the A320:  multiple variations of the A319 and A321 series are also affected. One estimate speculated that more than 3,000 A320 jets were in the air around the time of the Airbus announcement. Picture those passengers on November 28, many equipped with WiFi on board, reading about this software vulnerability and mentally reworking their safety calculations.



4 SDLC lessons. 2 inherent risks unbowed



Beyond sensationalized “solar radiation” or “cosmic ray” talk, there’s a serious software development life cycle (SDLC) conversation to be had at Airbus. I’d list these four main takeaways, all of them familiar:




Test engineering



CI/CD and pipeline quality



Observability



Supply chain




Notice that “coding” is not one of the takeaways. True, the L104 might have introduced a build packaging mistake, or a coding error, such as an accidentally deleted call to a service, misconfigured or misunderstood API parameters, or even a syntax error in the source code. These are all normal; a healthy SDLC addresses them.




Test engineering. A good test harness could simulate the out-of-band telemetry that was supposed to invoke the range checks for ELAC.  Test harnesses need to be designed and built concurrently with software, not as a separate stage.



CI/CD and pipeline quality. You can add Change or Configuration Management to this group. Whether or not Airbus used CI/CD in its SDLC pipeline in L104, it will be moving in that direction. Something broke in the SDLC pipeline, which allowed this fundamental feature to “regress.”  The cause is unlikely to be a one-off.



Observability. I’m adding this one partly because I’m part of a small working group at IEEE working on a new version of the DevOps standard that will incorporate observability principles. The SEU is an excellent use case for observability because a test engineer can’t wait for a cosmic ray to strike, yet must ensure that a failure to respond to a critical SEU event can be observed. This involves more careful requirements engineering and understanding of the telemetry needed for critical features.



Supply chain. While Thales may not have been involved in the problematic release of L104, the Airbus platform includes software and hardware from many suppliers. Integration across the computing supply chain presents challenges magnified by both the safety requirements and the desired product longevity. The apparent “Not our problem” response from Thales could indicate issues with joint information and problem-solving, or even limited visibility for the third-party risk management team.




It could get worse, a lot worse. Lapses in any one of these four areas of the SDLC create opportunities for malware, a nightmare scenario for avionics.



AI to the rescue?



I worry that two inherent risks remain largely unmitigated: complexity and specialization. Managing the entire A320 feature set, or even its software bill of materials (SBOM / API-BOM), is a nontrivial undertaking. Consider that it is a product launched in 1987 with the need to support legacy hardware and software across a large installed base.  Both complexity and specialization will march steadily toward greater opacity, challenging attempts at traceability, transparency and manageability.



No doubt Airbus, like the rest of us, will bring AI on board to help out — perhaps in L105. This will add both to the specialties needed and to the plane’s overall complexity.  Considering public trepidation over AI generally, at what point will more travelers feel the odds are no longer in their favor?

The AirPods Pro 3 are $40 off right now on Amazon,"If you haven&#39;t yet upgraded to Apple&#39;s AirPods Pro 3, you can pick up the company&#39;s latest model at a discount through a deal on Amazon right now. The AirPods Pro 3, which came out in September, are currently down to $210. That&#39;s $40 off and only $10 more than the record-low price we saw last week. The Pro 3s have been fluctuating in price since Black Friday, with the lowest they&#39;ve been being $199 for a brief period. With the new AirPods Pro, Apple made some big improvements, including better battery life and sound quality, and introduced useful new features, such as Live Translation. 

  
The AirPods Pro 3 are the best AirPods available today, with Apple&#39;s H2 chip, and earned a score of 90 out of 100 in Engadget&#39;s review this fall. Active noise cancellation (ANC) is one of the biggest selling points of the AirPods Pro, and Apple has made the experience even better with the AirPods Pro 3. They sport new foam-infused ear tips that create a better seal to improve passive noise isolation, and as Engadget&#39;s Billy Steele wrote in his review, &#34;Ultra-low-noise microphones combine with advanced computational audio to silence even more background noise.&#34; In testing, they had no problem blocking out the chatter of people nearby or otherwise noisy environments. 
With the AirPods Pro 3, Apple introduced heart-rate sensing, so you&#39;ll be able to see your heart rate data from the earbuds in the Fitness app and other workout apps. The AirPods Pro 3 also boast Live Translation, which you can activate via controls on the earbuds themselves. As long as you have an Apple Intelligence-capable device, you&#39;ll be able to translate in-person conversations in English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish and Chinese (Mandarin).

Divinity: Original Sin 2 for modern consoles is free for old fans,"The definitive version of Divinity: Original Sin 2, the sequel to Original Sin first released back in 2017, is now available for the PS5, Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox X|S. The role-playing game was developed by Larian Studios, the same company that developed Baldur’s Gate 3. To be clear, the game’s new release isn’t a remake or even a remaster — it’s just a port for new consoles so that old and new fans alike can enjoy the game without having to bust out their previous-gen devices. Fans who already own a copy of the game can even get it for free. Original Sin 2 is the fifth main entry in the Divinity game series. In it, gamers play a sorcerer who can wield forbidden magic and who gets captured by the Magisters of the Divine Order so they can be “cured” of their powers. Players can make their character from scratch, creating their own class and giving their character the abilities, skills and stats they want. But they can also use any of the pre-set characters the game provides.Players who already have the 2017 version installed will get a free upgrade applicable to their console. If they don’t have it installed anymore, they can go to game’s store page on their new device and download the upgrade for free — aside from fans in Japan who’ll have to pay ¥100 for the Switch 2 and PS4 upgrade. Larian is also working on the latest entry to the franchise, simply called Divinity, which is its biggest and most abitious game to date.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/divinity-original-sin-2-for-modern-consoles-is-free-for-old-fans-130000192.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2FIMG_0080.jpeg&resize=1400%2C814&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=ba3b732440203b8d9b77c9d25b763fb9b4684fa0,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/divinity-original-sin-2-for-modern-consoles-is-free-for-old-fans-130000192.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-16T13:00:00Z,7,Tech

Hollow Knight: Silksong's upcoming DLC pack will be free for all players,"One of 2025&#39;s splashiest games, Hollow Knight: Silksong, is getting its first major DLC expansion, developer Team Cherry announced in a blog post. The nautically-themed Sea of Sorrow update will come to the moody Metroidvania some time in 2026, and better still, it will be free for all players. 
The DLC will include &#34;new areas, bosses, tools and more,&#34; the developer wrote. There aren&#39;t a lot of clues to the gameplay in the short trailer below, but the four shots definitely relay the vibe. The first shows what looks like fishing tackle, then we see something (or someone) on a tomb-like wooden platform tied under a canvas sheet.

The Anker Laptop Power Bank soothed my (self-inflicted) battery anxiety,"For the longest time, I refused to upgrade my work-issued MacBook. I was leery of the hassle, and would much rather hang on to an aging Intel-powered laptop than have to transfer files, set up apps and sign in to accounts all over again. What did it matter if my notebook barely lasted long enough to cover an iPhone launch? My petty brain blamed it all on external factors (like being forced to use a MacBook instead of a PC), and left me dripping in stress as I watched the power levels dip down to zero at many of the live events I attend every year. So when I saw the Anker Laptop Power Bank was one of the items in our Labor Day deals roundup this year, I decided to get one to alleviate my battery anxiety (instead of, you know, doing the sane thing and agreeing to a new laptop).
When I unboxed my new Laptop Power Bank the night before the iPhone 17 Pro launch, I wasn’t expecting to be so taken by its features. All I knew before then was that this was a solid, beefy laptop battery pack, squeezing 25,000mAh in a compact package that would save me from having to worry too much about finding an outlet. But when I saw the screen light up with details on the amount of energy left (to two decimal places!) and the real-time charge data when I plugged it in, I was impressed. How modern!
Then I noticed the built-in cables — one retractable and neatly tucked inside the charger and the other artfully curved into a groove and doubling as a handle. Both wires were braided and felt like they’d be resistant to fraying and destroying themselves over time. Altogether, the general build quality and functionality of all the components made it clear this was a thoughtfully designed product worthy of all the praise and money we’ve hurled at it since my colleagues first tested it. 
But what truly made me smile (and giggle, honestly) was a naughty little Easter egg. I saw posts on Threads indicating that if you tugged on that retractable cable and let it go in and out a few times, the screen would show a smiley face. I didn’t believe this was true until I saw it for myself. Sure, it felt a little bit odd, but I told myself I was revving a chainsaw, and doing legitimate testing for professional reasons, not jerking off a device. And when I saw the funny face appear, I felt the effect was humorous rather than pervy. The good news for the more staid readers is that if you don’t want to ever see that face, you never have to. And if you like cheeky little touches in your tech products, the Anker Laptop Battery Charger will delight. 
Regardless of how I felt about having pleasured a laptop battery charger, it doesn’t take away from the fact that this is a well-made, well-rounded product. It managed to get my MacBook a few extra hours, so I made it all the way to the end of a multi-hour keynote, though it did run completely empty so I couldn’t recharge my phone after. Blast Apple Park and its utter lack of available power outlets!
Anker’s Laptop Battery Pack effectively allayed my battery anxiety, brought me some mirth and won me over with its thoughtful design. And because I got it on sale, it was $90 well spent.

The Morning After: Roomba maker iRobot files for bankruptcy,"iRobot, the company that brought robotic vacuum cleaners to homes and popular culture, has filed for  bankruptcy. It plans to sell all assets to its primary supplier, the Chinese company Picea Robotics. Investors “will experience a total loss and not receive recovery on their investment” if the deal is approved, iRobot said. The company didn’t discuss how the move might affect its employees in the US or elsewhere.
Amazon dropped its $1.7 billion acquisition of the company last year after a veto threat from European regulators, leaving the Roomba maker with no other option. Political scrutiny came on two fronts: The company was also reportedly hit hard by Trump’s tariffs in Vietnam, where it manufactures products for the US market.
iRobot launched its first Roomba in 2002, arguably inventing the world of robot vacuums — and the first robots to enter many of our homes. Competition from rivals has chipped away at its dominance, with other companies coming in at both lower and higher prices, like Roborock, Dyson and Anker’s Eufy.

‘Featured’ Urban VPN caught stealing private AI chats,"
		
					  
						




Security researchers have found that Urban VPN Proxy, a widely used free browser VPN extension with millions of installs, has been collecting and exporting full AI chat conversations from users’ browsers.



For organizations where employees routinely paste internal context, code snippets, customer details, or investigative notes into AI tools, the behavior represents a direct data-exfiltration channel operating entirely outside traditional enterprise security controls.



The issue is not limited to VPN traffic or encrypted sessions.



According to Koi Security’s findings, urban VPN injects scripts that activate whenever users interact with popular AI platforms, capturing both prompts and responses, even when VPN features are disabled.



Hidden scripts in “privacy” armor



Apart from offering a VPN service, Urban VPN Proxy deployed “executor” scripts that activate when a user opens AI chat platforms like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, Grok, and others. “Each platform has its own dedicated script-chatgpt.js, claude.js, gemini.js, and so on,” Koi researchers said in a blog post.These scripts override key browser network APIs to intercept everything a user types and receives, package it, and send it off to Urban VPN’s backend systems. The underlying code continuously monitors AI conversation content and related metadata, and uploads it regardless of VPN use.



The Chrome extension carries high ratings and a “Featured” badge by Google, giving users an implicit trust signal, the researchers noted. “The badge from Google means it had passed manual review and met what Google describes as a high standard of user experience and design,” they said.



Google did not immediately respond to CSO’s request for comments.



Both Chrome and Edge variants of the extension remain live on the Chrome Web Store and the Edge Add-ons store, respectively.



Urban’s storefront marketing even highlights an “AI protection” feature that claims to check user prompts for sensitive data. But Koi found that this protective framing runs independently of the surveillance layer, exfiltrating all AI interaction data whether users want it collected or not.



Crooks stole chats from 8 million accounts



Koi researchers revealed that Urban VPN is operated by Urban Cyber Security Inc., which is affiliated with BiScience (B.I Science Ltd), a data broker company.



“This company has been on researchers’ radar before,” the researchers added. “Security researchers Wladimir Palant and John Tuckner at Secure Annex have previously documented BiScience’s data collection practices.” Their research found that BiScience collects re-identifiable clickstream data at scale and monetizes it via its SDK and products like AdClarity and Clickstream OS.



Hundreds of millions of AI conversations have been captured, pooled across multiple extensions from the same publisher, reaching a combined user base well over eight million.Koi noted that the AI conversation capability on Urban VPN was introduced through extension updates over time, evolving from earlier browsing telemetry into broader monitoring of generative AI interactions as these tools gained mainstream adoption. The findings echo broader warnings that browser-based AI tools and extensions are becoming an unmanaged risk layer for enterprises, and should be treated as part of the attack surface rather than mere convenience features.

The best mobile microphones for 2026,"There’s nothing more frustrating than shooting the perfect reel only to realize that the audio sounds like garbage. For budding creators, it’s a frustration; for those looking to make more professional content, it’s a dealbreaker. Fortunately, the world of mobile-specific (or phone-friendly) microphones has exploded with great options in the last few years. Whether you’ve been tasked with recording candid moments at a relative’s wedding, shooting a friend’s dance moves or are a journalist out in the field traveling light — there’s an option out there that will be perfect for you.We’ve tested a wide range of popular microphones with a mobile focus so that you don’t have to. Below is our hand-picked list of the very best options for a variety of use cases. Some microphones — the wireless lavalier kind, for example — will be more versatile and convenient, useful for a number of different applications. Others, such as our musician or field-recording picks, are where we explore more exotic form factors such as shotgun mics and mobile-friendly desktop options. As always, above everything else is sound quality and general performance. The good news for you is that we’ve done all the hard work for you. Happy recording! 
Best phone mics for 2026: Best wireless mics for creators 
“Creator” is a broad term, but for the purposes of this guide, it’s anyone that wants to make videos or recordings to share on the internet. This is possibly the most exciting category right now with excellent options from brands such as Rode and DJI, but also some compelling budget options too. Once the domain of TV and pro productions, wireless lavalier mics are now the go-to choice for anyone creating in front of (or even behind) the camera. They usually sound great, offer hands-free flexibility and premium models come with extra features that will streamline your creative process. 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  
How we test mobile microphones 
The world of mobile microphones has exploded in recent years thanks to affordable, high-quality wireless systems, the popularity of social media and content creation and, of course, Apple’s reluctant switch to USB-C on the iPhone which has removed connectivity complications for manufacturers. 
When it comes to testing, my experience as a journalist, podcast producer, YouTuber and (failing) music producer has given me a lot of real-world experience with a wide variety of products all aimed at different jobs. When compiling this guide for Engadget, I filter that experience down to a few simple criteria that allows us to focus on what’s important to you, the reader and whatever it is you’re trying to record. 
The main criteria for mobile microphones are simple: Does it sound great? Does it connect to a phone directly and reliably? And, is it good value for its intended purpose? A hobbyist and a professional have different budgets after all. 
What every microphone endures is repeated recording in treated, non-treated and outdoor environments. I’ll also A/B test each one against its rivals and usually a suitable reference microphone — Shure’s SM7b for podcasting microphones or Rode’s NTG 5 for shotgun/video mics, for example. 
Some sub-categories of microphone require a slightly different approach. For wireless systems, I test how far I can walk from the receiver before recordings degrade, along with a standard battery life test by setting them to record until they power off. For podcast and vocal-focused microphones, I record in different spaces to see how they cope with different environments and measure self noise (recording “silence”). Lastly, I test how they sound when recording at different distances from the microphone.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-mobile-microphones-for-recording-with-a-phone-154536629.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2Ff8f860b0-d5cb-11f0-9fff-62f7b080df8a&resize=1400%2C840&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=372f715419f554e69cd58e02f65edc0044d9726b,https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-mobile-microphones-for-recording-with-a-phone-154536629.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-16T10:01:25Z,8,Tech

How to create a ransomware playbook that works,"
		
					  
						




Ransomware attacks continue to plague organizations, and they’re getting ever more sophisticated via tactics such as double- and multi-extortion and the use of artificial intelligence to create more refined attacks, and the growth of the ransomware-as-a-service model.



CISOs and CSOs need to make it a priority to create a playbook for their organizations to better defend against such attacks.



It’s clear that ransomware remains a big cybersecurity threat. Security firm CrowdStrike, in its new State of Ransomware Survey, notes that ransomware readiness is lagging as cyber criminals “use AI across the attack chain to accelerate intrusion, encryption, and extortion.”



The report, based on a global survey of 1,100 IT and cybersecurity decision-makers, shows that 76% of organizations are struggling to match the speed and sophistication of AI-assisted attacks. About half of the respondents cite AI-enabled attack chains as today’s greatest ransomware threat, and 85% say traditional detection is becoming obsolete against AI-enhanced attacks.



“When it comes to ransomware, most companies are still treating it like a distant threat until it hits. Then it’s chaos,” says Trevor Horwitz, CISO at security company TrustNet. “A good ransomware playbook isn’t just documentation. It’s muscle memory. You have to train like you fight.”



Here are some key elements to consider for an effective ransomware approach.



Planning and tabletops: Preparedness begins with practice



Any organization that doesn’t have a cohesive plan in place for how to handle ransomware threats is asking for trouble. Planning an overall strategy — encompassing tools, processes, and people — is vital for maintaining business continuity and minimizing financial losses.



Without a plan in place, enterprises risk launching a disorganized and ineffective response to attacks, which can result in lost data, significant systems downtime, compliance issues, and damaged brand or reputation.



A key component of the planning process is to conduct cybersecurity tabletop exercises to simulate how teams would conduct themselves during an actual ransomware attack. This enables organizations to test and improve their incident response plan in a no-risk environment, with a focus on decision-making, communication, and establishing clear-cut roles.



“Tabletop exercises are where everything starts,” Horwitz says. “If your executive team hasn’t sat in a room and worked through a simulated ransomware attack, start there. You don’t want to be figuring out who has the authority to pay a ransom or issue a public statement in the middle of an actual breach. You want to know how fast legal, IT, and [communications] can work together. The pressure is intense, and the decisions come fast. So the playbook should guide those decisions, not just sit on a shelf.”



These exercises enable enterprises to “create and maintain a ransomware-specific incident response playbook that defines roles, containment processes, forensic collection procedures, and communications templates,” says John Otte, senior security consultant at technology consulting firm Resultant.



“Perform realistic tabletop exercises with legal, communications, IT, and executive stakeholders, at a minimum annually, to test decision-making,” Otte says.



Tabletop exercises need to simulate real business disruption scenarios, not just technical failures, says George Gerchow, CSO at security firm Bedrock and faculty member at IANS Research, a research and advisory firm. “Effective ransomware preparedness begins with practice, not panic,” he says. “The most valuable sessions include leaders from operations, legal, finance, HR, and communications, because these teams face the toughest decisions under pressure.”



Staffing, skills, and training



Many organizations continue to find that cybersecurity experts are in short supply, so staffing up teams is a challenge. That can be problematic for a ransomware strategy. Companies need to have a variety of skills in place, including expertise in incident detection and prevention, incident response, firewall configuration, and other areas.



They also need to be equipped to train all employees in how to help prevent ransomware attacks. This includes teaching them how to recognize, deal with, and report threats such as phishing emails, suspicious links, and questionable attachments.



“On the staffing side, you need people who know what they’re doing,” Horwitz says. “Not just cybersecurity folks, but people across legal, PR, and leadership. And not just headcount. You need readiness. A named incident commander. Someone with forensic skills. Someone who understands business risk and knows when to escalate.”



Organizations often invest in tools before investing in people, and that’s backwards, Gerchow says. “Resilience relies on cross-functional preparedness, where employees understand not just what to do but why it matters,” he says.



Enterprises need to hold role-appropriate security training for users, including business leaders, IT teams, finance, etc., on realistic threats such as social engineering and malicious attachments.



Business leaders should encourage ongoing training that connects cybersecurity risk to business continuity and reputation, Gerchow says. “It’s about building a culture where everyone, from the help desk to the boardroom, understands their role in maintaining operational integrity,” he says. “Regular awareness programs, role-specific response drills, and executive briefings help translate technical risks into business terms.”



Prevention steps



Enterprises can invest in a range of technology solutions for both protection against ransomware attacks and remediation following an incident. Ransomware prevention requires a layered approach that includes regular software updates and patching, effective data and systems backups, and other cybersecurity tools such as firewalls, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and antivirus software.



Patch management and vulnerability remediation are vitally important elements of ransomware defense, because ransomware attackers oftentimes exploit security flaws — increasingly in security devices themselves. By addressing both of these areas, companies can proactively defend against ransomware threats.



“Maintain a prioritized and trackable patching program that keeps exploitable exposure to a minimum,” Otte says. “Couple automated deployment of patches with human verification of high-risk systems, and regularly run scans to identify drift or skipped patches.”



Endpoint detection and response (EDR), antivirus (AV) software, email security and phishing defenses, and identity and access management/MFA are also important pieces of any ransomware strategy, Otte says. “Use a modern EDR that contains behavior-based detection, rollback, and isolation capabilities rather than relying solely on signature AV,” he advises.



One of the main ways ransomware attackers carry out their missions is via email. “From an IT security standpoint, the No. 1 attack vector is an email system,” says Russ Ernst, CTO at Blancco, a provider of data erasure and mobile lifecycle diagnostics products. “Email security best practices must be implemented across the entire organization.’



Email security can include advanced phishing filters to prevent common ransomware delivery mechanisms, Otte says. Sophisticated access management can help minimize threats.



“Implement MFA anywhere you can, particularly for privileged accounts and remote access, and implement least-privilege principles to restrict opportunities to move laterally by attackers,” Otte says. “Keep admin credentials secured within a centrally managed secrets store, regularly rotate them, and don’t have shared local admin accounts. Insist on MFA before any privilege elevation. Track anomalous credential usage and apply detection against brute-force or lateral movement that employs privileged credentials.



Recovery and remediation



If a company experiences a ransomware attack, it needs to go into recovery and remediation mode as quickly as possible to minimize the damage. This includes recovering systems and data as well as repairing any damage affecting employees, customers, and the corporate brand.



“Create comprehensive recovery playbooks with system restore sequence prioritized and public communications strategies that target customers, regulators, and law enforcement,” Otte says. “Engage legal counsel, cyber insurance points of contact, and forensic responders in advance to make informed, timely, and notification requirement-appropriate determinations.”



When a ransomware attack happens, “the remediation needs to be fast but precise,” Horwitz says. “You have to isolate systems immediately. Stop the spread. Kill off the malware’s communication paths. Bring in forensics to figure out how they got in. Because if you don’t understand the entry point, restoring from backup might just reintroduce the threat.”



Enterprises need to verify their backups before using them, Horwitz says. “I’ve seen companies restore clean-looking data only to discover the malware had been sitting dormant for weeks,” he says.



They also need to ensure regular backup processes are in place, Ernst says. “It is important to regularly back up data and also to test these backups regularly,” he says. “Data that is regularly backed up in an offline environment will not be affected by a direct ransomware attack.”



Access to this stored data should help minimize downtime, Ernst says. “Backups also help you rebuild infrastructure if you choose to pay the ransom and get encryption keys — only to find your data has been corrupted and made unusable. If the organization understands how long it takes to rebuild from a backup, then it can infer the estimated downtime from a ransomware attack,” he says.



Organizations that might consider negotiating with ransomware gangs on ransom payments should also keep on top of the latest advice and tactics.



The recovery process is not just technical, Horwitz says, but also reputational. “If customer trust is shaken, you have to rebuild that fast,” he says. “That means communicating clearly, owning what happened, and explaining what’s being done. Law enforcement has to be notified. Regulators too. And the lessons from that attack need to go right back into the playbook. What worked? What didn’t? Where did the team freeze up? That feedback loop is what strengthens your program.”



Having an effective internal and external ransomware communications plan is vital. “A ransomware attack communications strategy should be part of an organization’s general company playbook related to security breaches,” Ernst says. “It should spell out who must be informed — employees, customers, investors, other stakeholders — as well as how and when, what any communications will say, and who will do the communicating.”

Google to Shut Down Dark Web Monitoring Tool in February 2026,"Google has announced that it&#39;s discontinuing its dark web report tool in February 2026, less than two years after it was launched as a way for users to monitor if their personal information is found on the dark web.
To that end, scans for new dark web breaches will be stopped on January 15, 2026, and the feature will cease to exist effective February 16, 2026.

Google is retiring its free dark web monitoring tool next year,"Google will stop sending out dark web reports starting early next year, as it shuts down the free tool that can tell you if your personal information has appeared on the seedy underbelly of the internet. The tool used to be exclusively available to Google One subscribers until the company opened it up to everyone in mid-2024. If you switch it on, you’ll receive a notification whenever your name, email address and phone number leak on the internet, typically due to data breaches. In Google’s email announcement, however, it said it was discontinuing dark web reports because “feedback showed that it did not provide helpful next steps.” A report just lets you know that your information has appeared on the dark web. You can also see a list of all the hits you get on your Google account, along with what data breach leaked that particular detail. However, it doesn’t give you guidance on what to do afterwards. The company explained that it will focus on tools that can give you clear, actionable step to take instead. Google will stop monitoring for new dark web results on January 15, 2026 and will remove access to the report from your account on February 16. You can also remove your monitoring profile right now by going to the “results with your info” section on the tool’s official page.

LG will debut its first Micro RGB television at CES,"LG is getting in on one of the newest trends for televisions with the introduction of Micro RGB. The company will unveil the LG Micro RGB evo at CES 2026, but it shared some preliminary information about the screen today.
Micro RGB is a newer screen technology where rather than white lights, the backlight can be any hue thanks to individually controlled red, green and blue Micro LEDs, offering a wider color array. This approach is a mid-way point between the precision of OLED with its individual pixel lighting, but it offers an upgrade over screens only using mini LEDs.
The television is also equipped with an upgraded engine for AI upscaling. According to the company&#39;s press release, the LG Micro RGB evo is certified by Intertek for 100 percent color gamut coverage in BT.2020, DCI-P3, and Adobe RGB. The TV has more than a thousand dimming zones for brightness control.
The few other brands currently using micro RGB are charging a pretty penny for it; the one announced by Samsung earlier this year costs $29,999. At 115 inches, the Samsung version is also much larger than LG&#39;s offerings, which include options at 100 inches, 86 inches and 75 inches. Although the size is reduced, expect the eventual prices for the LG Micro RGB evo to also be very expensive.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-will-debut-its-first-micro-rgb-television-at-ces-010037923.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F36ad38b0-da0c-11f0-bf6b-b56688ca4947&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=df54975c99d881a2d7e60295484597baf40ca776,https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-will-debut-its-first-micro-rgb-television-at-ces-010037923.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-16T01:00:37Z,7,Tech

Judge blocks Louisiana's social media age verification law,"A Louisiana law that would have required social media platforms to verify the ages of their users has been blocked by a judge. The law, known as the Secure Online Child Interaction and Age Limitation, was passed in 2023 and required Meta, Reddit, Snap, YouTube Discord and others to implement age verification and parental control features.The ruling came just days before the law, which technically took effect over the summer, would have started to be enforced. In his ruling, Judge John W. deGravelles wrote that the law&#39;s &#34;age-verification and parental-consent requirements are both over- and under-inclusive,&#34; and that its definition of &#34;social media platform&#34; was &#34;nebulous.&#34;The ruling was a victory for NetChoice, a lobbying group that represents the tech industry and has challenged the growing number of age verification laws around the world. The group had argued that the law was unconstitutional and posed a safety and security risk.In a statement following the ruling, the group pointed to the &#34;massive privacy risk&#34; posed by the Louisiana law and others like it. &#34;Louisiana’s law would have done more than chill speech,&#34; Paul Taske, the co-director of NetChoice’s Litigation Center said. &#34;It would have created a massive privacy risk for Louisianans like those playing out in real time in countries without a First Amendment, like the UK.&#34;The Louisiana Attorney General&#39;s office didn&#39;t immediately respond to a request for comment.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/judge-blocks-louisianas-social-media-age-verification-law-001212758.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2F2025-12%2Fbb784e78-baa2-4885-9ced-eb9216e7fd3a&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=5efb1df4790dc88636bfb7309d057f48db319a4c,https://www.engadget.com/social-media/judge-blocks-louisianas-social-media-age-verification-law-001212758.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-16T00:12:12Z,7,Tech

LG quietly added an unremovable Microsoft Copilot app to TVs,"Microsoft made a big punt this year with Copilot. The company put its AI chatbot into a special line of laptops and has also tried to integrate it into other tech products. The latest place you may find Copilot is on your LG smart television, whether you want it or not.
Several LG smart TV owners have taken to Reddit over the past few days to complain that they suddenly have a Copilot app on the device and cannot uninstall it. Two Engadget staffers discovered the app on a 2022 LG OLED and a 2023 UA8000. They confirmed that the app can&#39;t be removed, although they were able to hide it from the home screen. One other person from our team also has a 2022 LG OLED but isn&#39;t seeing Copilot, so your mileage may vary based on what permissions and privacy settings you already have set up with LG.
Karissa Bell for Engadget
LG said during the 2025 CES season that it would have a Copilot-powered AI Search in its next wave of TV models, but putting in a permanent AI fixture is sure to leave a bad taste in many customers&#39; mouths, particularly since Copilot hasn&#39;t been particularly popular among people using AI assistants.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/lg-quietly-added-an-unremovable-microsoft-copilot-app-to-tvs-235923754.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F6957db30-da11-11f0-adff-d76060a84346&resize=1400%2C1050&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=9bb6524cec03de45fed8548645f5f45b701cc007,https://www.engadget.com/ai/lg-quietly-added-an-unremovable-microsoft-copilot-app-to-tvs-235923754.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-15T23:59:23Z,7,Tech

Ford is rebooting the F-150 Lightning as an EREV with a gas generator,"Just last month, Ford seemed to be on the brink of sunsetting the F-150 Lightning. Today, the vehicle manufacturer announced plans to reboot the truck as a hybrid. This next generation of the F-150 Lightning will contain Extended Range Electric Vehicle. An EREV is similar in concept to a plug-in hybrid but with a larger battery that&#39;s topped up by a gas generator — the powertrain itself is all electric. This next generation of the F-150 Lightning will offer an estimated range of more than 700 miles. Production will end this year on the current F-150 Lightning models.
This revamp of the F-150 Lightning is part of Ford&#39;s latest approach to electric vehicles. The company projected that by 2030, half of its global volume will be comprised of hybrids, extended-range EVs and electric vehicles, compared with 17 percent today. &#34;As part of these actions, Ford no longer plans to produce select larger electric vehicles where the business case has eroded due to lower-than-expected demand, high costs and regulatory changes,&#34; the company&#39;s press release states. Ford will also swap its planned electric commercial van for North America with a new, affordable commercial van that has both gas and hybrid options. The company anticipates seeing a $19.5 billion negative impact for this pivot away from EVs.

Best white elephant gift ideas 

  
According to legend, the King of Siam would give a white elephant to courtiers who had upset them. The recipient had no choice but to simply thank the king for such an opulent gift, knowing that they likely could not afford the upkeep for such an animal. It would inevitably lead them to financial ruin. This story is almost certainly untrue, but it has led to a modern holiday staple: the white elephant gift exchange. These gift ideas will not only get you a few chuckles, but will also make your recipient feel (slightly) burdened.

Apple TV app for Android now supports Google Cast,"Apple TV is adding Google Cast support to its native Android app. This update allows subscribers to stream Apple TV shows from their smartphones to their televisions. Apple&#39;s streaming service only just released the dedicated app for the Android operating system in February 2025. Adding in Google Cast support helps fully integrate the app into the experience for people whose gear is part of the Android ecosystem.
The addition should make it easier for viewers to shift between screens, even mid-episode. It&#39;s a very different approach than Netflix, which recently ended Google Cast support for its streaming platform in most use cases.

Fallout season 2's first episode will premiere a little earlier than expected,"In an era where we often have to twiddle our thumbs for three years before a new season of a TV show we enjoy returns to our screens, the second season of Fallout has had a relatively short turnaround. It&#39;s set to hit Prime Video 20 months after the first batch of episodes. As it turns out, the season two premiere is going to arrive a little earlier than you may have anticipated as well. 
The first episode will now hit Prime Video at 9PM ET on December 16. That&#39;s six hours earlier than expected. So if you&#39;ve been looking forward to catching back up with Lucy, Maximus and The Ghoul, you won&#39;t have to stay up as late on Tuesday night to catch the premiere as soon as it&#39;s available.

However, you won&#39;t be able to binge the entire season this week. While Amazon dropped all of Fallout season one at once in April 2024, this time around it will release episodes on a weekly cadence through February 4.
Fallout was also in the news late last week when Prime Video offered up an error-ridden, AI-generated recap of season one. Amazon responded to the backlash (the Fallout fallout, if you will) by nixing AI video recaps from Prime Video entirely.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/fallout-season-2s-first-episode-will-premiere-a-little-earlier-than-expected-205018028.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F0976acc0-d9f6-11f0-bb53-6aa5abcdc92d&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=39878339e3922dd949f36a5346c40f6aaf6c70a2,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/fallout-season-2s-first-episode-will-premiere-a-little-earlier-than-expected-205018028.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-15T20:50:18Z,7,Tech
Bungie's Marathon will arrive in March,"
Bungie’s Marathon has a new release window. The survival extraction shooter was originally set to hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and PC in September, but by June, Sony had delayed it indefinitely. Now, with a plagiarism issue largely in the rearview mirror, Bungie has confirmed that Marathon will arrive in March and and plans to sell it for $40.
Alongside the release date and price announcement, Bungie released a 23-minute video that takes a deep dive into the game and shows off the current state of Marathon. New features include proximity chat and a solo mode, while Bungie says it has upgraded the environmental storytelling and visual fidelity. Gritty environments provide a nice contrast to the glossy sci-fi sheen that defined Marathon’s visual language in our earliest looks at the game.
There’s a lot more on deck for Marathon’s first year including new maps and events. Bungie also plans to release more shells, which are akin to character classes that can be customized by changing your loadout. The Rook shell, for instance, is a new one that the studio has added since the alpha playtests. This shell allows you to join a run that&#39;s already in progress. You’ll have a limited loadout, but you’re not really risking anything valuable as you run around to loot items.
There’s a lot riding on Marathon. Parent company Sony Interactive Entertainment said last month that Destiny 2 had not lived up to its expectations and it wrote down the value of Bungie’s assets by $204 million. Back in August, Sony asserted more control over Bungie and said the developer was “shifting into a role that is becoming more part of PlayStation Studios.”
That’s hardly the only issue Bungie has faced this year. The studio admitted in May that one of its former employees plagiarized the work of artist Fern Hook by enabling it to be used in Marathon’s in-game textures. Earlier this month, Hook said that Bungie and Sony had resolved the matter “to my satisfaction.”This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/bungies-marathon-will-arrive-in-march-200838426.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2Fc4561680-d9f0-11f0-ba5c-a08e4df61a4e&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=adb810881d0c37574beaa2149535d9c35d9fece9,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/bungies-marathon-will-arrive-in-march-200838426.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-15T20:43:22Z,7,Tech

Back in August, Sony asserted more control over Bungie and said the developer was “shifting into a role that is becoming more part of PlayStation Studios.”
That’s hardly the only issue Bungie has faced this year. The studio admitted in May that one of its former employees plagiarized the work of artist Fern Hook by enabling it to be used in Marathon’s in-game textures. Earlier this month, Hook said that Bungie and Sony had resolved the matter “to my satisfaction.”This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/bungies-marathon-will-arrive-on-ps5-and-pc-in-march-200838462.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2Fc4561680-d9f0-11f0-ba5c-a08e4df61a4e&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=adb810881d0c37574beaa2149535d9c35d9fece9,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/bungies-marathon-will-arrive-on-ps5-and-pc-in-march-200838462.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-15T20:08:38Z,7,Tech

Amazon sells MOBA March of Giants to Ubisoft,"Ubisoft is moving deeper into MOBAs after buying March of Giants  from Amazon and acquiring the team that made the game. As part of the agreement, Amazon will help promote March of Giants on Twitch. The deal is expected to close on December 16There’s no release date as yet for March of Giants. Amazon announced the free-to-play game back in August and there was a closed alpha playtest the following month. The next playtest will take place in 2026.  The next major update for March of Giants will include “new giants, expanded competitive modes and foundational systems designed to support long-term growth.”March of Giants is a 4v4 game in which players control giant war commanders. You’ll lead armies with thousands of soldiers and send them to attack enemy giants. Likewise, you’ll have to fend off the other team’s minions. You can also deploy reinforcements (called Battleworks) like trenches, tanks and bunkers to help you win a match.MOBAs aren’t entirely new territory for Ubisoft. While it’s ostensibly a third-person action game, For Honor checks all the MOBA criteria too. Although it clearly sees an opportunity in the MOBA market, Ubisoft will have a job on its hands to make March of Giants succeed in a space that’s dominated by League of Legends and Dota 2.March of Giants was in development at Amazon Games Montreal, a studio that was established five years ago. Several former Ubisoft employees are returning to that company as part of this deal. Many of them were part of the original creative team behind Rainbow Six Siege, including Amazon Games Montreal founder and March of Giants  creative director Xavier Marquis.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/amazon-sells-moba-march-of-giants-to-ubisoft-183948291.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2Fmarch.jpg&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=684e3988005ceb216fcb0eb3967028d342f245e2,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/amazon-sells-moba-march-of-giants-to-ubisoft-183948291.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-15T18:39:48Z,13,Tech

'Slop' is Merriam-Webster's word of the year,"Merriam-Webster has selected &#34;slop&#34; for the dictionary company&#39;s 2025 word of the year. The leading lexicographers define slop as &#34;digital content of low quality that is produced usually in quantity by means of artificial intelligence.&#34; We&#39;ve seen an absolute deluge of AI slop this year, from fake movie trailers on YouTube to AI-generated bands on Spotify. Not even food delivery like Uber Eats could escape the onslaught of AI-generated garbage that no one asked for.
It&#39;s gotten to the point that half the videos my well-meaning parents send me on social media are AI-generated videos of dogs. This isn&#39;t all that surprising given how very intentionally the social media giants have added slop to all our feeds.
Merriam-Webster rightly points out the somewhat mocking nature of calling it “slop.” &#34;Like slime, sludge and muck, slop has the wet sound of something you don&#39;t want to touch. Slop oozes into everything. The original sense of the word, in the 1700s, was &#39;soft mud.&#39; In the 1800s it came to mean &#39;food waste&#39; (as in &#39;pig slop&#39;), and then more generally, &#39;rubbish&#39; or &#39;a product of little or no value,&#39;&#34; the dictionary distributors wrote.
As the proliferation of AI slop expanded, some platforms like TikTok and Pinterest got wise and began offering users the choice to tone down the sheer amount of it in their feeds. Even Spotify is at least trying to combat some of this stuff now, though that didn&#39;t stop an AI-generated copycat from going unnoticed on the platform for weeks. Elsewhere, companies like Google leaned in, incorporating Veo 3-generated videos into YouTube Shorts. We&#39;ll only be able to tell in hindsight if 2025 was the peak of AI slop, but for now it shows no signs of abating.
Merriam-Webster highlighted some other words for the year (some of which the chronically online will be familiar with), including Gerrymander, Touch Grass, Performative, Tariff, Conclave and Six Seven.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/slop-is-merriam-websters-word-of-the-year-181903322.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-03%2F57b0b230-0e47-11f0-9bbf-f6ac451e3611&resize=1400%2C874&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=ba6939ff74fdf79856ab10ec6d859c90119ef2fe,https://www.engadget.com/ai/slop-is-merriam-websters-word-of-the-year-181903322.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-15T18:19:03Z,12,Tech

"In 2025, tech giants decided smart glasses are the next big thing","There&#39;s a growing sentiment that gadgets have gotten boring. And while I don&#39;t fully agree, I understand why people might feel that way. Just think about some of the novel device types that companies have tried to push since the original iPhone came out. 3D TVs were a massive flop and tablets still feel like extra-large smartphones despite Apple&#39;s efforts to prop them up as laptop replacements. Meanwhile, even with huge technological advancements over the last decade, VR headsets remain relatively niche due to factors like high prices and a lack of compelling content. And although big names like Google, Microsoft, Meta and others continue to dump billions into AI development, the first wave of dedicated AI devices was an abject failure. When you think about it, the only new(ish) class of gadget that has made major inroads to the mainstream market is smartwatches. That said, because they&#39;ve evolved into wearable health and fitness sensors instead of the wrist-based computers that many once thought they would be, they haven&#39;t really disrupted our lives like the personal computer and smartphone did. But that seems poised to change because the tech giants have decided that smart glasses are going to be the next big thing. Headsets versus smart glasses, what’s the difference?Google is planning to support both smart glasses and headsets with Android XR, though the increased size and weight of devices like the Galaxy XR means it&#39;s not a great choice for all-day functionality. Sam Rutherford for EngadgetAt this point, you might be saying, &#34;Wait, hold on. Aren&#39;t VR headsets and smart glasses kind of the same thing?&#34; Well, yes and no. Both types of gadgets require similar software and hardware, but they utilize them in very different ways. Not only are VR goggles typically much bigger and heavier, they also provide a more isolated experience that can make it feel like you&#39;ve been transported to another world. Sure, most modern headsets have exterior cameras that support some level of mixed reality (blending virtual graphics with physical objects) or let you peek quickly into meatspace (passthrough view) for when you need to get a drink or acknowledge other humans in the room. But in many respects, that closed-off feeling is the goal because it creates the ideal environment for playing games, taking virtual meetings or modeling 3D objects without real-world distractions. Furthermore, while many headsets like the Vision Pro and the Meta Quest 3 can function as standalone systems and support accessories like controllers or other motion trackers, they can also be tethered to a nearby PC for enhanced functionality.  On the other hand, the default use case for smart glasses is a mixed reality environment where the spectacles can overlay helpful info or messages while you stay active and aware of your surroundings. Notably, while smart glasses might come with lenses or clip-on attachments that allow them to get darker or serve as sunglasses when you&#39;re outside, there typically isn&#39;t a way to completely block out the world like you can with a headset, mostly because that&#39;s simply not the point. And even though most smart spectacles can be paired with a phone to get access to mobile data or notifications, they&#39;re generally not meant to be tethered to a PC full-time (though there are some exceptions). The goal for smart glasses is more to provide a mobile-first heads-up display that augments what you see with your eyes instead of replacing things entirely with a digital environment. OK, but what makes you so sure that smart glasses are &#34;it?&#34;Now that we&#39;ve discussed what separates smart glasses from headsets, what makes it so obvious that they are going to be the next big thing? This one is a bit easier to answer because we can simply look at the sheer number of companies that have released smart glasses or are planning to do so in the future. If we skip past the Google Glass from 2013 as forward-thinking specs that were ahead of their time, the most well-known example of modern smart glasses is the Meta Ray-Ban (or the even earlier Ray-Ban Stories from back when Facebook was still Facebook). While they are a bit chunky, the Meta Ray-Ban Display are some of the most sophisticated smart glasses on the market right now due in large part to their single full-color screen. Karissa Bell for EngadgetEven though they don&#39;t have built-in displays, the ability to capture photos and videos and play audio via built-in speakers brought the idea of smart glasses into the mainstream without making the concept look or feel completely ridiculous. Those earlier models then paved the way for even more sophisticated iterations like the Meta Ray-Ban Display from earlier this fall, which features a stunning RGB HUD (though only in the right lens) that has gotten us tantalizingly close to a true wearable display that doesn&#39;t make you look like a cyborg. Of course, Meta isn&#39;t the only game in town: there&#39;s a rapidly growing number of competitors from companies like Even Realities, Rokkid, TCL, Xreal, Viture and more. But for an even clearer sign of where the tech giants are heading, we can just look at Meta&#39;s two biggest competitors: Apple and Google. While Apple hasn&#39;t publicly announced plans to make its own smart glasses, Bloomberg&#39;s Mark Gurman — who is one of the company&#39;s most reliable analysts — provided inside info earlier this fall that Tim Cook and Co. are planning to pivot away from a proper follow-up to the Vision Pro in favor of more lightweight spectacles with greater mass appeal. This shouldn&#39;t really come as a major surprise, as sales of Apple&#39;s $3,500 headset have been lackluster. But more importantly, for a company that&#39;s extremely cautious about entering new product categories (foldable iPhone anyone?), it feels very telling to hear that Apple is shifting to smart glasses instead of abandoning the idea of wearable displays entirely. This is a company that doesn&#39;t swing and miss very often, so the idea of two flops in a row seems preposterous. If this pivot is real, there must be some Apple execs who are big believers that glasses and not goggles are the right choice for future development. Here are two of Google&#39;s reference design smart glasses. The one in the front features dual RGB waveguide displays while the one in the back relies on a single monocular screen.Sam Rutherford for EngadgetMeanwhile, Google is taking a two-pronged approach. In addition to releasing a new mixed reality OS — Android XR — on Samsung&#39;s Galaxy XR headset in October, the company has also teased upcoming smart glasses along with a handful of partners including glasses makers Gentle Monster and Warby Parker.  Just this week, the company also added a number of new features to Android XR designed to support a wide range of upcoming devices while simultaneously making it easier for developers to port existing apps over to smart glasses and headsets. And if you still need additional evidence regarding Google&#39;s desire to get into smart glasses, consider that even with its ongoing collaboration, the company also spent $100 million to acquire a 4 percent stake in Gentle Monster. Regardless of who is making them though, the big draw for these companies is the idea that smart glasses will become a new piece of core personal computing, similar to how people rely on smartphones and laptops today (or to a lesser extent wireless headphones and smartwatches). If true, that could become a trillion-dollar market in the next 10 to 15 years (or sooner, who knows), which not only makes it a natural avenue for expansion but possibly a future existential crisis for certain companies. After all, none of these organizations want to be the next Microsoft after it failed to develop a successful smartphone or mobile OS.Fine, the smart glasses trend is real, but why would we even want them?At this point, I hope it&#39;s clear that the push for smart glasses is very real and very serious. But so far, we&#39;ve only addressed why companies are betting big on them. So what&#39;s in it for us, the people who might actually buy and use them? Well, to answer that, we need to separate the current models into three main categories.A great use case for smart glasses would be to provide heads-up mapping without the need to constantly look down at your phone as seen in this demo clip of Android XR. GoogleFirst, there are the most basic smart glasses that don&#39;t come with built-in displays and typically rely on cameras and built-in speakers for enhanced functionality. The best example of this class of devices is the Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses (or the original Ray-Ban Stories) along with rivals like the Bose Sound Frames, which, believe it or not, have been on the market since 2019. However, before anyone gets attached to these early models, the simplest smart glasses already kind of feel like dinosaurs and will probably, in the not-too-distant future, go extinct. They were an interesting attempt to add things like music playback or photo and video capture to regular-looking sunglasses, but their limited feature set puts a clear ceiling on what they can do. Plus, if this is what people really wanted, they would have taken off already. Waveguides like the ones built into the Even Realities G2  project images directly onto their lenses allowing for super sleek glasses featuring a heads-up display. Sam Rutherford for EngadgetThis brings us to more recent offerings like the Meta Ray-Ban Display, Even Realities G2, the Halliday glasses and others which add some type of built-in display to the mix. Most often, these models rely on waveguide displays as they enable thinner and lighter designs while propagating images onto the glasses&#39; lenses. Currently, most of these smart glasses feature single-color optics (usually green) to reduce complexity and power draw, but there are others like the Meta Ray-Ban Display and both the TCL RayNeo X2 and X3 that support full color.In this day and age when everyone is surrounded by screens, the idea of yet another display mounted inches away from your eyeballs might sound like the last thing you want. However, because modern smart glasses are much more discreet and less awkward-looking, I find that they can actually help cut down on distractions. That&#39;s because instead of having to peek down at your phone or smartwatch to check notifications, reply to messages or look up directions, you can do many or all of these things using smart glasses — all in the middle of a conversation without anyone noticing. Not only does this keep your focus where it should be — on people instead of gadgets — the glasses are also just as easy to wear as a smartwatch and far more comfortable than bulky VR headsets. Then, when you consider some other features of modern smart glasses like on-the-fly translation, the ability to function as a teleprompter hidden in plain sight or additional support from AI, suddenly you have a wearable that allows you to keep all of your other devices neatly stashed away. In many respects, smart glasses could be the portable displays that people might not even know they want.Compared to rivals with waveguides, glasses featuring &#34;birdbath&#34; optics are often significantly thicker and bulkier. Sam Rutherford for EngadgetSpeaking of portable displays: If you recall, I mentioned above how most smart glasses generally don&#39;t need to be tethered to other devices. The exception to that comes from a subclass of specs that are primarily designed to function as wearable monitors capable of supporting one or more virtual screens that can be in excess of 100 inches in size, relatively speaking. The most well-known smart glasses in this category come from Xreal and Viture, with both companies offering a range of models with varying levels of performance. One interesting thing to note is instead of waveguides, some of these smart glasses rely on birdbath optics. This means instead of projecting an image into the lens itself, they use a beamsplitter and mirror to reflect images into your eye. The benefit of this is that you get good image quality from components that cost less than an equivalent waveguide setup, with the downside being increased light loss, potentially lower brightness and a much thicker design. This results in chunky frames that often look like they are sitting too far away from your face, which might not be immediately apparent if you see someone using them from afar. But up close, they don&#39;t look quite right. Or at least they don’t look like a pair of &#34;normal&#34; glasses.Another issue is that due to more light loss, birdbath smart glasses require darker lenses (similar to sunglasses), which means they aren&#39;t great for wearing all day in a variety of environments. And because we still don&#39;t really have a great protocol for wireless displays (though it looks like Valve may be cooking up something with the Steam Frames), most of these  need to be connected by wire to a nearby PC. So you plug them in, put them on, get your work done and then you take them off. Project Aura is Xreal&#39;s next-gen smart glasses and they feature a large 70-degree field of view and fancy electrochromic lenses. Sam Rutherford for EngadgetThat said, for those who need a ton of screen real estate, this type of smart glasses can be a very attractive alternative to traditional portable monitors. On top of being smaller and more portable, they provide additional privacy when working in public spaces like a cafe or plane, which is what prompted a doctor friend of mine to get a pair instead of going with a portable display. And for the gamers out there, because they can be connected to a phone or even a portable PC or Switch 2 (with the proper dock, of course), they&#39;re great for people who might not have room for or access to a big screen TV.So where do we go from here?Ultimately, I think all three types of smart glasses will merge into one as engineers perfect the tech and steal ideas from one another, though there will surely be plenty of room for more niche designs. But more importantly, if we consider the types of gadgets most people carry around today, it boils down to just a handful of devices: a smartphone, some type of wireless audio (either earbuds or headphones) and maybe a health and fitness tracker of some kind (typically a smartwatch or smart ring). Even tough they didn&#39;t have a built-in display, the Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses from 2023 raised a ton of awareness for the category.Sam Rutherford for EngadgetSmart glasses have the potential to really round out that kit by allowing us to keep most of those devices in our pocket while the wearables serve up helpful info when we need it, but without being overly intrusive or distracting. In the short term, you&#39;ll still need a laptop for work, but smart glasses may have a role to play there too, as they can provide way more screen space than a traditional physical display (even the new-fangled flexible ones). It might never happen, but I wouldn’t rule out a future scenario where your next employer gives you a company-issued phone and a pair of smart glasses and that&#39;s it. Before that happens though, there are still a bunch of other things that need to be figured out. Without help from a mouse or keyboard, navigating a virtual display is a bit of a challenge. AI combined with hand and eye tracking can help, but no one has really nailed that combo yet. Not even Apple could do so on the much bulkier Vision Pro. To address this, Meta created a bracelet (they call it a neural band) that pairs with the Ray-Ban Display that can detect subtle movements so you can type or navigate menus practically anywhere. Even Realities opted for a ring accessory that does some basic health monitoring and comes with a tiny touchpad. In the more distant future, this hurdle may be solved by BCIs (brain-computer interfaces), but even the most optimistic view suggests that those aren&#39;t going to be mainstream for a long time.Even though we&#39;re still a long ways away, one day everyone might be able to have something like Tony Stark&#39;s E.D.I.T.H. smart glasses from the Marvel Universe. MarvelThe issue for Meta is that it&#39;s pretty obvious that its wristband really ought to be incorporated into a smartwatch. The idea of a single-purpose bracelet that doesn&#39;t track your health or do anything else sort of feels like a step backwards. And there&#39;s the problem of Meta&#39;s glasses being largely tied down to its own platforms (i.e. Instagram, Whatsapp and Facebook), which may end up being a major hindrance after rivals like Google and Apple catch up.And then there&#39;s the cost. Right now, a pair of Meta Ray-Ban Displays (which thankfully come with the wristband) costs $800. That&#39;s a lot for what is basically a publicly available beta test. But when you consider that an Even Realties G2 and an R2 ring costs even more at $850, it&#39;s clear that wearing smart glasses is going to be a very expensive hobby for at least the next few years. And while more single-purpose smart glasses from Xreal and Viture are a bit more affordable, with models ranging from $400 to $550 or $600, they still aren&#39;t cheap. On top of that, getting prescription lenses for smart glasses can often be a major pain in the ass and may not even be an option for people with more limited eyesight. But those are problems for another day. And just because tech giants are pouring billions into the development of smart glasses doesn&#39;t mean they will be a guaranteed hit. If you care about tech, alongside AI and possibly EVTOL aircraft (aka flying taxis), pay attention to the advancements in smart glasses. Otherwise, you could miss out on what might be the next major wave in sci-fi gadgetry made real.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/in-2025-tech-giants-decided-smart-glasses-are-the-next-big-thing-163000812.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2Fsmartglasses-are-the-next-big-thing.jpg&resize=1400%2C840&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=e669ad7b5dfd121b5cde20a4d36a76734c198a06,https://www.engadget.com/wearables/in-2025-tech-giants-decided-smart-glasses-are-the-next-big-thing-163000812.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-15T16:30:00Z,10,Tech

Swallowing the Moon and other new indie games worth checking out,"Welcome to our latest roundup of what&#39;s going on in the indie game space. Between The Game Awards and showcases like Day of the Devs, Wholesome Snack, Latin American Games and Women-Led Games, there’s been a ton of video game news over the last week (I need Control Resonant ASAP, please and thank you, Remedy). And hey, guess what? I&#39;ve got even more for you to dig into, including info on some new releases that you can play right now.One of those is a game I’d been looking forward to since about 2022, and it’s always nice when something you’ve remained patient for turns out to be worth the wait. In Sam Eng&#39;s Skate Story, you play as a demon who accepts a deal offered by the Devil. If the demon can ride a skateboard to the Moon and swallow it after being transformed into a creature made of “glass and pain,” the Devil will grant them their freedom. It’s just as strange as that setup sounds. While you’ll need to execute combos to defeat bosses, this is a skateboarding game that leans more heavily on story than pure gameplay. It’s visually and sonically arresting too, with Blood Cultures and John Fio crafting a killer soundtrack I know I’ll be listening to for a long time to come. Skate Story is out now on Nintendo Switch 2, Steam and PS5 for $20. PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium members can play it at no extra cost. New releasesUnbeatable is another game I’ve had on my radar for some time, though I haven’t had a chance to jump in yet. This is another stylish game in which you play as Beat, who sings in a band. However, music is outlawed in this world (oh no!). Through rhythm-based minigames and battles with cops, Beat tries to bring back the music. There&#39;s a separate arcade mode with a dedicated progression system too.I&#39;m a sucker for stories about rebellious underdogs, and this rhythm adventure could well hook me in. Unbeatable — from D-Cell Games and publisher Playstack — is available on Steam and PS5 for $28 (there’s a 10 percent discount on Steam until December 23). It&#39;s set to hit Xbox Series X/S very soon too.Speaking of games I&#39;ve been keeping an eye on, Adrift (from solo developer S.K.9.8 and co-publisher Secret Sauce) was one of the first games I covered when I started doing this weekly roundup earlier this year. It&#39;s a driving game in which your aim is to deliver a volatile energy core. Since you&#39;re traversing a hot desert, you&#39;ll need to be careful to prevent the core from overheating and blowing up. Thankfully, there are safe spots and cooling stations where you can bring down the temperature.The vaporwave aesthetic of Adrift caught my eye and although I dig the presentation, the game isn&#39;t quite clicking for me in the early going. It didn&#39;t take long before my vehicle got stuck and I had to reset, and I&#39;m finding the top-down world a little confusing to navigate. I&#39;ll stick with it for at least a little longer, though. Adrift is out now on Steam. It usually costs $13 though there&#39;s a 25 percent discount until December 23. I&#39;ve very happy that a game like Drywall Eating Simulator can exist. Peripheral Playbox&#39;s satirical walking sim sees your character trying to deal with the maddening realities of daily life and the frustration that one may find in dealing with other people. Get mad enough and you&#39;ll be able to punch through a wall (something you&#39;ll have to do to move through the levels anyway). Then, you can munch on some drywall to calm yourself down.I had a good time with it and there’s some pointedly funny writing here. “I thought AI sucks but it told me that was wrong and I believed it,” says one person. That&#39;s all well and good, but I mainly just want the NPCs to leave me alone so I can eat drywall in peace. Drywall Eating Simulator is out now on Steam. It&#39;ll usually run you $10, but there&#39;s a 10 percent discount until December 17.Planet of Lana was one of my favorite games of 2023 and now it&#39;s available on iOS and Android for $9. It sees teenage Lana and her cute companion Mui making their way through a world that&#39;s been taken over by alien robots as they try to rescue Lana&#39;s sister.This is a puzzle platformer in the vein of Inside and Limbo, and despite the pretty and often bright presentation, it&#39;s just as dystopian as those games. It sounds gorgeous too, thanks in large part to a beautiful score from The Last Guardian composer Takeshi Furukawa. I&#39;m very much looking forward to the sequel from Wishfully and publisher Thunderful. That&#39;s set to arrive next year.A Game About Digging A Hole is one of this year&#39;s real indie success stories. It’s a game that a developer started making in their spare time that has sold more than 1.2 million copies since February. After landing on PC and mobile, the $5 game from Doublebee and publisher Rokaplay is now on Nintendo Switch, Xbox Series X/S and PS5. It&#39;s on Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass Premium and PC Game Pass.It&#39;s a straightforward loop. Start digging a hole in your backyard, sell the stuff you find, upgrade your equipment and keep going. Just, uh, be careful down there. You never quite know what you&#39;ll run into.Upcoming Vampire Therapist developer Little Bat Games has revealed its latest project, Better Than Us, which is coming to Steam in 2026. It&#39;s a narrative-driven sci-fi narrative game in which you&#39;ll infiltrate swanky parties thrown by wealth hoarders in the future to steal spoils back from them. Violence isn&#39;t the solution here, as you&#39;ll need to charm the ultra-rich, who buy elections and have &#34;monopolized AI development to ensure machines serve their interests&#34; (I dunno, this all seems extremely far-fetched). You can spin up a web of lies about things like how your husband died and how much Worldcoin you have. To maintain your ruse, you&#39;ll need to keep your story straight by remembering what you said and to which characters. Okomotive (Herdling, Far: Changing Tides) just revealed its next game. PinKeep is a roguelike deckbuilder in which you&#39;ll place structures on a playing field to fend off enemies. To collect resources, you&#39;ll need to play some pinball. By using the flippers (and flicking the ball for more precise movement), you can pick up what you need to fight back against your opponents. You can damage bad guys directly with the balls too. As a Ball x Pit enthusiast with a tepid but growing interest in deckbuilders, this speaks to me. A PinKeep demo is coming to Steam in January, with the full game set to arrive late in 2026.AudioMech is a neat-looking game that popped up for the first time during the pre-show of The Game Awards. This is a rhythm-based action title from Dylan Fitterer, the creator of Audiosurf. It taps into whatever music you have playing on your computer (even something that you&#39;re streaming or playing through a microphone) to customize both your weapons and opponents.A track that&#39;s heavy on bass might give you a longer sword, while vocals and lead instruments can power a cannon. There are several ways to play, including a mode in which you don&#39;t take damage and a boss rush option. AudioMech is coming to Steam and there&#39;s a demo available now. Let&#39;s wrap things up with something a little more relaxing. Lost and Found Co. is a hidden object game from Bit Egg Inc. and co-publisher Gamirror Games. During the latest Wholesome Snack showcase, it was revealed that the game is coming to Steam on February 11.It&#39;s little wonder that more than 170,000 Steam users have wishlisted this game. It looks absolutely lovely. The developers sought to recapture the &#34;magic&#34; of childhood puzzle books in their hand-drawn world. Here, you&#39;ll help Ducky, a duck-turned-human intern at a startup that hunts for items that townspeople have lost. There&#39;s a demo available that features the option to decorate a part of the world using items you find.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/swallowing-the-moon-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-154937071.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2Funbeatable.jpg&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=faf42046a4465b349508e847ccdb2d448ebc3a78,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/swallowing-the-moon-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-154937071.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-15T15:49:37Z,10,Tech

The 5 power skills every CISO needs to master in the AI era,"
		
					  
						




At one global manufacturing client, an AI model flagged a potential breach pattern that turned out to be normal behavior from a test server. The system wasn’t wrong — but the humans stopped questioning it. It took a single analyst with strong data storytelling skills to realize the oversight and prevent a full production shutdown. That’s what separates automation from understanding.



The shift no security leader can ignore



When I began advising CISOs and cybersecurity leaders in critical industries, the conversations were about firewalls, audit checklists and incident response playbooks. Then automation arrived — and, soon after, artificial intelligence. Suddenly, everything we thought defined technical excellence began to evolve.



Today, AI has become both an equalizer and a differentiator. It accelerates detection, automates response and surfaces insights we couldn’t see before. But here’s the paradox: the smarter our tools become, the more human our differentiators need to be — with AI acting as a force multiplier for skills like critical thinking and data fluency.



That’s why a new generation of power skills is emerging — the capabilities that will determine which cybersecurity professionals remain indispensable in the decade ahead.



By 2030, nearly half of all cybersecurity tasks will be automated — but the leaders who thrive won’t be the ones coding faster. They’ll be the ones thinking deeper.



Why traditional skill sets are no longer enough



CISO action item: Run a 1-hour “AI Bias Audit” on your top 3 detection rules this quarter.



Ask: “What data is missing? Who is underrepresented?”



According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report, nearly 40% of core job skills will change by 2030, driven primarily by AI, data and automation.



For security professionals, this means that expertise in network defense, forensics and patching — while still essential — is no longer enough to create value. The real impact comes from how we interpret, communicate and apply what AI enables.



AI doesn’t just speed up decisions — it reshapes them. When a model identifies an anomaly, we need humans who can:




Translate it into business risk,



Challenge the model’s assumptions and



Communicate the findings clearly to leadership.




That’s not a technical ability. That’s a power skill.



The 5 new power skills for the AI era



1. Data fluency and analytical thinking



Cybersecurity is now inseparable from data science. Every alert, log and anomaly is a data problem first — and a security problem second. In my consulting work, I’ve seen teams fail not because their tools were weak, but because their analysts couldn’t interpret what the data truly meant.



Being data fluent means questioning the data, recognizing bias in models and turning analytics into narratives that drive decisions.



2. Risk literacy and governance intelligence



AI introduces new risk categories — from algorithmic bias to model transparency and explainability. Future-ready CISOs must understand these challenges, not just from a compliance angle, but as part of strategic governance.



Emerging frameworks set the tone:




NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF 1.0)



U.S. Executive Order on Safe, Secure and Trustworthy AI




Risk literacy isn’t just about security controls — it’s about anticipating where technology, ethics and law intersect.



3. Executive communication



I’ve sat in boardrooms where brilliant engineers failed to influence executives because their insights were lost in translation.



In the AI era, clarity equals influence. The ability to write, present and simplify complex concepts — especially when dealing with probabilistic AI outcomes — determines who gets heard and who doesn’t.



Effective communication is no longer “soft.” It’s strategic.



4. Cross-functional collaboration



AI doesn’t exist in silos — and neither should cybersecurity. The most successful programs today bring together:




Data scientists



Privacy officers



Operations leaders



Legal advisors




Real-world impact: At a global energy provider with 40,000 endpoints, a joint AI threat modeling workshop between security and data science teams cut mean-time-to-detect (MTTD) for ransomware precursors from 14 hours to 4 hours — not through new tools, but through shared context.



That’s the tangible value of collaboration.



5. Ethical foresight and creative thinking



As AI blurs the line between automation and autonomy, human judgment becomes the final safeguard. Questions like “Should we?” will matter more than “Can we?”.



Professionals who can anticipate unintended consequences — from biased AI outputs to over-reliance on automation — will be the ethical backbone of digital trust.



Empathy and creativity, once considered “soft skills,” are now among the hardest skills to automate.



The dual edge of AI in cybersecurity



AI isn’t just transforming defense — it’s transforming offense.



Generative models enable:




Hyper-targeted phishing



Automated reconnaissance



Synthetic identity attacks




At the same time, AI-powered detection and response tools identify shadow IT, data leaks and persistent threats at unprecedented speed. But there’s a catch: AI amplifies both strengths and weaknesses.




Poor data governance → model drift



Incomplete context → false positives



Without ethical and human oversight → disastrous decisions




That’s why building the human layer of cybersecurity — judgment, ethics and context — is now mission-critical.



For years, CISOs have been judged on the absence of incidents. But AI changes that metric. When algorithms take over detection and reporting, visibility doesn’t mean accountability. The challenge is shifting from preventing breaches to proving control — not through dashboards, but through narrative and governance. The CISO’s new dilemma is this: how do you lead when the system knows more than you do?



Building the future-ready security team



Three actions to take this quarter:




Invest in power skills — not just tools.



Perform regular skill-gap analyses that include communication, governance literacy and data storytelling.



AI can automate tasks, but not wisdom. Encourage continuous learning.




AI evolves faster than any policy. Create programs for:




Red-teaming AI systems



Collaborative simulations across departments




Integrate disciplines. Combine cybersecurity, data science and business strategy. This multi-lens approach strengthens both resilience and innovation.



Leadership takeaways




Translate technical insights into executive language.



Treat AI like a team member, not a tool.



Reward curiosity, not only compliance.



Build trust faster than you build automation.




Redefining CISO success metrics



Tomorrow’s CISOs will be measured less by incident counts and more by how effectively they align AI-driven security initiatives with business outcomes.



New KPIs to consider:




% of AI alerts translated into executive risk briefings



Cross-functional project velocity (security + data science)



Ethical AI review completion rate




Championing ethical innovation



Make AI ethics a standing agenda item in every risk review.



Transparency and accountability should be as central to cybersecurity as encryption and patching.



What this means for cyber leaders



The biggest myth in security is that technical mastery equals longevity. In truth, the more we automate, the more we value human differentiation.



Success in the next decade won’t depend on how much code you can write — but on how effectively you can connect, translate and lead across systems and silos.



When I look at the most resilient organizations today, they share one trait: They see cybersecurity not as a control function, but as a strategic enabler. And their leaders? They’re fluent in both algorithms and empathy.



The future of cybersecurity belongs to those who build bridges — not just firewalls.



Cybersecurity is no longer a war between humans and machines — it’s a collaboration between both. The organizations that succeed will be the ones that combine AI’s precision with human empathy and creative foresight. As AI handles scale, leaders must handle meaning. And that’s the true essence of power skills.



The future of cybersecurity belongs to those who can blend AI’s precision with human expertise — and lead with both.

New users can get half off one of our favorite budgeting apps right now,"If you have a resolution in the new year to get more acquainted with your finances, a good budgeting app can help with that. One of our favorites is a bit cheaper to sign up for right now: Monarch Money is offering 50 percent off annual subscriptions for new users. Use the code MONARCHVIP at checkout to get half off, so you&#39;ll pay just $50 for one year of access. 

  
Monarch Money was the runner-up in our guide to the best budgeting apps in 2025, and it was definitely a grower. Initially we found the experience of using the app to be needlessly complicated compared to some of its rivals, but get over that hurdle and it’s impressively fully-featured. There are plenty of customization options, a helpful “goals” feature and a thorough month-in-review recap that beats out similar features from some of its competitors. We also like how you can grant account access to others. 
Besides the steep learning curve, we also noted that the mobile app is less intuitive to use than the web version, which might pose a problem if you were hoping to do most of your accounting on the go. We also had some issues with the app failing to distinguish between bills and other recurring expenses, as well as a few bugs along the way. 
All things considered, Monarch is definitely one of our favorite budgeting apps, only being beaten out by Quicken Simplifi. As you might expect, the biggest strength of Simplifi is its simplicity, and how it eases you into using its various features. If you value that kind of user experience, it might be a better choice for you, but there’s unfortunately no free trial to take advantage of.

The Meta Quest 3S is back down to its Cyber Monday all-time low of $250,"The Meta Quest 3S is back on sale at its all-time low price of $250. That&#39;s $50 off, or a discount of 17 percent, and matches a deal we saw on Cyber Monday. 

  
The 3S is the more affordable model in the company&#39;s current VR headset lineup. It features the same Snapdragon XR2 processor as the more expensive Meta Quest 3, but with lower resolution per eye and a slightly narrower field of view. 
In our hands-on review, we gave the Meta Quest 3S a score of 90, noting how impressive the tech was compared to its price. The headset was comfortable to wear during longer gaming periods, and the performance was quick and responsive thanks largely to the upgraded processor and increased RAM from the Quest 2. 
We were big fans of the new controllers, which the 3S shares with the more expensive Quest 3. This new generation of controller sports a more refined design, shedding the motion tracking ring and leaving behind a sleek form factor that fits in your hand like a glove. 
We did miss the headphone jack, though most users are probably fine with the built-in speakers. You can wirelessly connect headphones for higher quality sound if you feel the need. The Quest 3S also recycles the old Fresnel lenses from the Quest 2, which can lead to some artifacts. 
If you were considering a VR headset for yourself or a loved one this holiday season, the Meta Quest 3S offers an excellent value alongside impressive performance.

No more orange juice? Why one ship reveals America’s maritime cybersecurity crisis,"
		
					  
						




A single vessel called the Orange Star docks at Port Elizabeth in New Jersey, carrying 38,848 cubic meters of orange juice concentrate. One ship, arriving weekly, supplies orange juice used by all of the city’s major retailers. If Port Elizabeth’s systems went down tomorrow due to a cyber attack, 46 million consumers within the four-hour trucking radius would feel the impact within days.



The threat is real. The recent government shutdown furloughed CISA and FEMA staff at a critical time of exposure and vulnerability. The legal framework that allowed threat intelligence sharing between government and industry? That expired on September 30th when Congress failed to reauthorize the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015. And the malware? That’s already in place, pre-positioned by nation-state actors waiting for the right geopolitical moment to trigger it.



This is what one might call the “perfect storm of vulnerability,” and it’s hitting US maritime infrastructure right now.



The evidence isn’t theoretical



In late 2024, hackers hit the Port of Seattle with ransomware, demanding $6 million and releasing sensitive data on the dark web when their demands weren’t met. But the real threat extends far beyond opportunistic ransomware actors.



As a member of the Area Maritime Security Committee (AMSC) for Sector New York with the US Coast Guard, I see firsthand how maritime facilities are preparing for the new Title 33 CFR cybersecurity requirements that went into effect in July 2025. Some ports, like the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, have the resources and maturity to comply. They’ve been conducting penetration tests, red team exercises and tabletop drills for years.



But what about the other 2,300+ facilities regulated under the Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA)?



Consider SeaPort Manatee in Florida — a facility that moved 11.8 million tons of cargo in 2024, generating $7.3 billion in economic impact. They spent $97,500 on a cybersecurity assessment in June 2024, with 75% funded by a DHS FEMA Port Security Grant Program. That’s one facility doing it right. But while they were still recovering from Hurricane Milton damage, how many smaller facilities were scrambling to find even that level of funding?



When Japan’s Port of Nagoya was hit by ransomware in 2023, originally attributed to the Russian-affiliated LockBit gang, the central computer system was compromised and cargo operations were suspended for several days. The 2021 Suez Canal blockage by the Ever Given — a physical incident, not cyber — caused an estimated $10 billion per day in stalled trade. Now imagine that disruption triggered deliberately by malware already embedded in port systems such as gantry cranes.



This is a workforce problem, not a vendor problem



The new regulations require all 3,000 MTSA facilities to designate a cybersecurity officer (why the Coast Guard named them CySOs and couldn’t just call them CISOs, I do not know). Finding hundreds of qualified people who understand both operational technology in maritime environments and cybersecurity is nearly impossible. Many facilities are looking at IT professionals who will require cross-training on maritime technology systems and assets with 30+ year life cycles. This is quite different from the capital expenditure write-off of a laptop every 3–5 years.



Especially concerning is the fact that thousands of CISOs are considering leaving their corporate roles because they’re tired of being used as scapegoats when breaches occur. Hopefully, some are now looking for side work as part-time contractors with maritime facilities, treating it as job-loss mitigation while doing something that gives them genuine job satisfaction. If hired, they would immediately see the benefits of their work improving the security posture of a port facility in their hometown.



This is our critical infrastructure protection strategy: exhausted professionals moonlighting because facilities can’t afford full-time qualified staff.



What developers and security teams can actually do



If you’re reading this and thinking, “I don’t work at a port, why does this matter?” then consider your own supply chain dependencies. Your company most likely delivers services using third-party solutions, many of which depend on maritime logistics you never even think about. The systemic risk that emerges from complex systems means a port shutdown doesn’t just delay Amazon deliveries.



During the pandemic, we couldn’t get toilet paper or laptops. Our supply chains were deeply disrupted by a health crisis. Now imagine that kind of pervasive disruption triggered deliberately, with government cybersecurity staff having been furloughed at a critical moment or no legal framework to safely share threat intelligence because Congress let it expire.



Three concrete steps for this quarter:




If you’re responsible for critical infrastructure or provide services for core supply chain systems, conduct a realistic resilience assessment of what a 72-hour maritime disruption would mean for your operations. Not a theoretical risk assessment but a practical business continuity exercise.



For mid-sized facilities facing these requirements, budget between $20,000–$25,000 for penetration testing. Explore FEMA’s State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program (SLCGP), though be aware these often have non-federal match funding requirements. Better yet, find ways for academia, private sector and public sector entities to collaborate, such as the MTS-ISAC, rather than forging ahead in isolation.



If you’re a CISO considering what’s next in your career, consider that maritime facilities desperately need your expertise. This isn’t corporate security theater. This is mission-critical work protecting infrastructure that millions depend on. That you and your family depend on.




The saber-rattling is getting louder



The current geopolitical climate has maritime security at a heightened level of readiness for international conflict. If a nation-state wanted to discourage US intervention in some form of aggression in APAC, South America or elsewhere, the malware is already believed to be in place, ready to be triggered.



In my discussions as part of the AMSC, we workshop scenarios constantly. What counts as an incident when the MARSEC (MARitime SECurity) Level needs to be elevated from 1 to 2 for a cybersecurity threat? MARSEC Level 2 requires additional protective security measures for a period of time across nautical facilities and vessels.



This is the kind of thing that hasn’t happened yet, but for which we train constantly. The challenge is that anything compromising safety systems in a port would trigger a shutdown of the entire port. There’s an element of systemic risk to the complex ecosystem that ports support that includes rail, trucking, shipping, fuel or, yes, that weekly orange juice delivery.



The US Coast Guard has been granted fairly large powers of authority in the event of an incident. But those powers are compromised when CISA staff have been furloughed and threat intelligence sharing has lost its legal protection. We can expect asset owners and sector agencies to continue to collaborate, but they will be doing so with additional (and avoidable) risk.



Monday morning action items



I lived in Manhattan during the first COVID lockdowns. I saw SWAT teams with sniper rifles taking up positions on rooftops across from grocery stores. That was contingency planning that thankfully didn’t need to be activated. But it revealed something crucial: Anything that threatens the ability to procure basic necessities will rapidly escalate in ways we’d rather not contemplate.



The orange juice example isn’t about orange juice. It’s about what the Orange Star represents. A complex system held together by aging infrastructure that 3,000 facilities now need to better secure, with cybersecurity officers they don’t have, using grant funding that was stuck during the government shutdown, while the legal framework for threat sharing has expired and nation-state malware sits dormant in their systems.



What you should do Monday morning: Elevate the discussion around cybersecurity risk with elected officials, boards of directors and everyday citizens. Accept the mantra of incident response: it’s not a matter of if, but rather just a matter of when.



As an information security professional who has worked in this industry for 30+ years and who has given birth to major ecommerce sites in the Web 1.0 dotcom bubble, building and protecting banks and critical infrastructure in the ensuing years, I am not optimistic. Do we have the gumption and grit to do what’s needed?



We must work together now with focus, conviction and verve, because the alternative is unthinkable. I mention the word “verve” because I feel there must be a creative energy to how we champion our collective resilience and how we defend our community, our democracy and our way of life.



There’s no incident response plan for a perfect storm. Only preparation before it hits.

CISA orders immediate patching as GeoServer flaw faces active exploitation,"
		
					  
						




CISA is sounding the alarm over a critical vulnerability in GeoServer that is being actively exploited in the wild, ordering federal agencies to patch immediately.



The flaw, tracked as CVE-2025-58360, is an unauthenticated XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability affecting GeoServer versions 2.26.1 and earlier. When exploited, the bug lets attackers retrieve arbitrary files from vulnerable servers, allowing data theft, denial-of-service attacks, or server-side request forgery (SSRF) that can expose internal systems.



GeoServer, an open-source platform for publishing and sharing geospatial data, is widely used across civilian, scientific, and defense-linked federal environments. “GeoServer is widely used across federal agencies that manage land, water, and geoscience data,” said Louis Eichenbaum, federal CTO of ColorTokens, noting that it often runs alongside ArcGIS and remains connected back to enterprise GIS systems, even in otherwise segmented or air-gapped deployments.



CISA added CVE-2025-58360 to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog this week, citing active exploitation. Advisories from Wiz and the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security indicate that exploit code has circulated since late November, giving attackers a head start before coordinated patching could happen.



An exposed platform with real intelligence value



CVE-2025-58360 (CVSS 9.8 out of 10) stems from GeoServer’s handling of XML input using an insecurely configured XML parser that fails to properly restrict external entity references. A crafted request can force the server to fetch local files or make internal network requests, enabling unauthenticated file disclosure and potential SSRF against systems the GeoServer instance can access.While XXE bugs are a familiar class of vulnerability, researchers warn that GeoServer’s role inside government environments makes this flaw particularly sensitive. According to Shadowserver, at least 2451 IP addresses with GeoServer fingerprints are currently observable, while Shodan reports more than 14,000 GeoServer instances exposed online.



“What concerns me most about CVE-2025-58360 is that GeoServer has become a strategic intelligence-collection platform for nation-state adversaries,” said Certis Foster, senior threat hunter lead at Deepwatch. “This isn’t companies tracking weather or logistics anymore; this is coordinated infrastructure reconnaissance at scale.”



Foster warned that unauthenticated access through the bug could allow adversaries to extract geospatial intelligence tied directly to energy assets, weather systems, and military locations.



CISA’s alert marks the third GeoServer vulnerability it has flagged as actively exploited in just over a year, following warnings in June 2024 and July 2024 related to earlier flaws. The pattern suggests GeoServer is no longer an incidental target but a recurring one.



Why patching alone may not be enough



While CISA has mandated patching for federal agencies, experts caution that speed is often constrained by operational realities, including asset discovery, dependency mapping, and change-management windows, that can slow even well-resourced teams.



“When vulnerabilities are disclosed in widely deployed platforms like GeoServer, almost no federal agency can realistically patch fast enough,” Eichenbaum noted. “Even if they could, by the time a notice is public, the adversary may already be exploiting it.” That reality reinforces the need for “breach-ready” posture grounded in Zero Trust principles, he added.



Venky Raju, field CTO at ColorTokens, echoed the concern, saying, “open-source developers are quick to respond with fixes, however, enterprises may not be able to patch servers due to internal challenges.” As an interim measure, he recommended isolating affected GeoServer instances using microsegmentation controls to restrict lateral movement, while still maintaining mission operations.



While the CISA notice applied to Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies, directing them to patch before December 26, 2025, it “strongly urged” all organizations to timely remediate the issue.

iRobot has filed for bankruptcy and may be taken over by its primary supplier,"iRobot, which brought robotic vacuum cleaners to the masses with its iconic Roomba models, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The Massachusetts-based company plans to sell all assets to its primary supplier, a Chinese company known as Picea Robotics. If approved by a bankruptcy court, the move would allow iRobot to &#34;continue operating in the ordinary course, pursue its product development roadmap, and maintain its global footprint,&#34; iRobot wrote in a press release.
The company expects the deal to close in February 2026, but says it will continue to operate &#34;with no anticipated disruption to its app functionality, customer programs, global partners, supply chain relationships or ongoing product support.&#34; That means your Roomba should continue to clean normally and you&#39;ll be able to get consumables and replacement parts. 
However, investors of common stock &#34;will experience a total loss and not receive recovery on their investment&#34; if the deal is approved, iRobot stated. The company didn&#39;t discuss how the move might affect its employees in the US or elsewhere. 
Bankruptcy seemed a likely outcome for iRobot after Amazon dropped its $1.7 billion acquisition of the company last year following a veto threat by European regulators. The company&#39;s fortunes continued to decline and it issued a statement to investors in March 2025 that it had &#34;substantial doubt about [its] ability to continue.&#34;
It&#39;s a sad turn of events for the company that invented the robotic vacuum niche and launched its first product, the Roomba, back in 2002. It dominated that space for more than a decade, but its market size has steadily shrunk more recently, particularly since Covid, due to competition from rivals like Roborock and Dreame. 
Though iRobot retooled its product lineup earlier this year with new models like the Roomba 105 Vac Robot series and Roomba Plus 505 Combo Robot + AutoWash Dock, but they failed to move the sales needle enough. The company was reportedly hit hard by Trump&#39;s 46 percent tariff in Vietnam where it manufactures products for the US market. 
If the sale is approved, iRobot says it will return in force. &#34;Today&#39;s announcement marks a pivotal milestone in securing iRobot&#39;s long-term future,&#34; said CEO Gary Cohen. &#34;The transaction will strengthen our financial position and will help deliver continuity for our consumers, customers, and partners.&#34;This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/irobot-has-filed-for-bankruptcy-and-may-be-taken-over-by-its-primary-supplier-091602257.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F95fc2ac0-d98e-11f0-bbee-058f7a56a2c2&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=42f673f64289f39a9a8907e6e94b7ec8ce18545f,https://www.engadget.com/home/irobot-has-filed-for-bankruptcy-and-may-be-taken-over-by-its-primary-supplier-091602257.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-15T09:16:02Z,13,Tech

Cybersecurity leaders’ top seven takeaways from 2025,"
		
					  
						




Over the last 12 months, security teams continued to walk a tightrope between moving fast to adopt new technologies and facing escalating threats fuelled mostly by the rise of AI. As the year comes to a close, CISOs reflect on some of the takeaways that have shaped the security landscape in 2025.



1. AI gave defenders more muscle power



If 2024 was the year AI crept into cybersecurity, 2025 was the year it took over, with Smartsheet CISO Ravi Soin describing the technology as being “transformational”.



“There isn’t a single company or single user across the globe that hasn’t really faced the effects of [AI] in one shape or another,” he says.



AI has reduced manual work and tightened controls over large attack surfaces. It helped mapping controls to the data evidence in a faster way, Soin tells. “Before we were manually collecting evidence, we were making sure our systems were going through it. But now we can pull this together in a very efficient manner.”



AI gave security teams – and businesses more broadly – a huge productivity boost, reducing their reliance on external consulting and research firms, according to Calendly CISO Yassir Abousselham. “We’re able to do a lot more. It’s like having the entire human knowledge in our pockets.”



2. AI forced companies to rethink their security strategies



At the same time, Abousselham notes how the rapid rollout of AI forced companies to shift their resources to keep pace with the change, while maintaining safe product releases. He calls 2025 the “chaotic introduction of agentic AI”.



“I don’t think the industry was ready or expected the rapid developments of this technology, and how every single organization is trying their best to be a first mover and essentially moved all – or a good chunk – of their investment in just deploying and developing products and features around artificial intelligence. That trend impacted security … and forced us to refocus our investments, and in some cases, replan a lot of the priorities that we had already in place.”



3. AI supercharged attackers



The same technology powering defenses allowed adversaries to move faster, target more precisely, and scale campaigns that used to require human effort. The contrast between attack styles has become increasingly stark. While some campaigns remain undetected for months and quietly move through networks to expand access and exfiltrate data, there are others that are executed in minutes, and attackers complete their objectives before alerts are triggered.



“Swifter attacks are being fueled by artificial intelligence. Threat actors are leveraging AI to automate reconnaissance, craft highly personalized lures, and generate audio and visual deepfakes that exploit human trust at scale,” Mandy Andress, CISO of Elastic, says. “The result is a growing convergence of technical and psychological attack surfaces that target the human link or use AI to rapidly bypass traditional signature-based detection and rule-based systems.”



That convergence is already showing up in the most common entry points. Soin sees this happening directly in phishing and social engineering. “You used to detect a phishing email by spotting grammatical errors in an email or because a logo didn’t look right. Now you have perfectly crafted emails. You have deepfakes. You have systems that can be compromised no matter how sophisticated they are. It’s truly uncharted territory.”



The same trend has been playing out in tooling, according to Amit Jain, global head of cybersecurity and GRC services at HCLTech. Attackers are upgrading the sophistication of their code. “AI-led adversaries were the biggest emerging threat this year, using generative AI for generating evasive self-modifying malicious code, deep fakes, precision phishing, and automated exploit development.”



4. The threat actor is now a machine



The rise of AI-driven adversaries has fundamentally changed what a “threat actor” looks like. What used to be a human sitting behind a keyboard is now an automated system that never tires, never slows down, and constantly learns.



“As AI gets smarter and smarter, they’re learning about the defenses you have in place, coming up with counterattacks that can defeat your defenses, going back in time for the last 10 years of vulnerabilities that may still be exposed, and using them in creative ways to get at it,” Soin says.



This has pushed the threat landscape into entirely new territory. “We’re in very uncharted territory from a cyber perspective, where the notion of AI has made it easier for threat actors to become smarter in how they attack you.”



5. Non-human identities exploded



As organisations raced to deploy AI agents, automation pipelines, and machine-to-machine workflows, Abousselham believes it also led to the explosion of non-human identities. He explains how every AI agent, whether it’s an autonomous workflow tool, an API-driven integration, or an MCP client, now requires its own identity with permissions, access levels, and lifecycle management, and the pace is accelerating faster than most security teams are prepared for.



This rise in machine identities has already driven significant investment, not just in human bandwidth, but in new solutions and technologies capable of managing identity operations at scale.



“There is a need for an acceleration in how we onboard, maintain, and manage these identities … we must ensure these agents are governed, managed, properly authenticated and authorized, and that we can deprecate them at the end of their cycle,” Abousselham says.



And this shift isn’t limited to AI agents alone. Andress says the industry has doubled down on fundamentals as identity sprawl grows, particularly around the configurations and controls that underpin both human and non-human access. “This includes protecting non-human identities, such as API keys, tokens, and service accounts, which have become common entry points for attackers,” she says.



6. Third-party risk took centre stage



Third-party attacks surged in relevance throughout 2025 as organizations expanded their technology stacks and adopted more SaaS platforms, AI tools, and automated integrations.



Pointing to recent breaches involving major service providers like Salesforce, Soin says high-profile incidents are a reminder that an organization’s risk surface extends far beyond its own perimeter. “When companies depend on third-party software, it becomes even more important for us to think through the stack of what that looks like and ensuring that enterprises are depending on technologies that have security at the forefront in what they do,” he says.



Jain observes that 2025 marked a turning point in how organizations approached governance and vendor oversight, noting there was stronger alignment between compliance, governance, and resilience, supported by automation, advanced analytics, and continuous third-party assurance. “In essence, 2025 was the year when cybersecurity pushed itself to become a shared business responsibility rather than a siloed security function.”



While stronger governance and automated oversight provide the framework, Jain emphasizes that security ultimately depends on the daily decisions of everyone in the organization. “True security comes from habit, behavior, and culture. Every click, every decision, every configuration, every third-party integration now carries weight.”



7. Regulatory pressures hit the board



Government oversight grew stricter in 2025. Regulations demanded faster reporting, tighter controls, and accountability at the senior leadership level, according to Jain. “Boards are no longer satisfied with compliance checklists. They expect measurable resilience, ROI in terms of risk optimization, demonstrated preparedness, and continuous reporting. This has made cybersecurity a strategic lever, influencing M&amp;A decisions, supply chain partnerships, and even go-to-market business strategies.”



Meanwhile, international frameworks like IRAP, ISO, and NIST are being enforced more rigorously, says Soin. “Standards may not have changed as much as we think they have. But the enforcement of those standards is getting stricter. We’re seeing a lot more, as an example, customer contracts or regulations on expectations from customers, and for the right reasons.”

Google pulls AI-generated videos of Disney characters from YouTube in response to cease and desist,"Google seems to be cracking down on the use of Disney characters in AI-generated videos on YouTube after it was hit with a cease and desist letter. According to reports by Variety and Deadline, the company removed dozens of videos featuring Deadpool, Moana, Mickey Mouse, Star Wars characters and other Disney IP as of Friday, just days after Disney accused it of &#34;infringing Disney’s copyrights on a massive scale.&#34; The letter, seen by both publications earlier this week, called out Google not just for hosting these videos on YouTube, but also for using copyrighted works to train models including Veo and Nano Banana.
Prior to this, Disney has come after Character.AI as well as Hailuo and Midjourney — both of which it&#39;s suing — over AI-related copyright infringement. But, that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s shunning AI-generated content altogether. The company on Friday announced a deal with OpenAI that will bring Disney characters to Sora and ChatGPT, and bring AI-generated shorts from Sora to Disney+.

"Grok is spreading inaccurate info again, this time about the Bondi Beach shooting","In the same month that Grok opted for a second Holocaust over vaporizing Elon Musk&#39;s brain, the AI chatbot is on the fritz again. Following the Bondi Beach shooting in Australia during a festival to mark the start of Hanukkah, Grok is responding to user requests with inaccurate or completely unrelated info, as first spotted by Gizmodo.
Grok&#39;s confusion seems to be most apparent with a viral video that shows a 43-year-old bystander, identified as Ahmed al Ahmed, wrestling a gun away from an attacker during the incident, which has left at least 16 dead, according to the latest news reports. Grok&#39;s responses show it repeatedly misidentifying the individual who stopped one of the gunmen. In other cases, Grok responds to the same image about the Bondi Beach shooting with irrelevant details about allegations of targeted civilian shootings in Palestine.
The latest replies still show Grok&#39;s confusion with the Bondi Beach shooting, even providing information about the incident to unrelated requests or mixing it up with the shooting at Brown University in Rhode Island. xAI, Grok&#39;s developer, hasn&#39;t officially commented on what&#39;s happening with its AI chatbot yet. However, it&#39;s not the first time that Grok has gone off the rails, considering it dubbed itself MechaHitler earlier this year.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/grok-is-spreading-inaccurate-info-again-this-time-about-the-bondi-beach-shooting-203946515.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2Fb06b0140-d927-11f0-b7e5-4b0f28371158&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=8be61b9e5184207f9e25ef6cf1fa48438be1cead,https://www.engadget.com/ai/grok-is-spreading-inaccurate-info-again-this-time-about-the-bondi-beach-shooting-203946515.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-14T20:39:47Z,7,Tech
Kindle's in-book AI assistant can answer all your questions without spoilers,"If you&#39;re several chapters into a novel and forgot who a character was, Amazon is hoping its new Kindle feature will jog your memory without ever having to put the e-reader down. This feature, called Ask this Book, was announced during Amazon&#39;s hardware event in September, but is finally available for US users on the Kindle iOS app.
According to Amazon, the feature can currently be found on thousands of English best-selling Kindle titles and &#34;only reveals information up to your current reading position&#34; for spoiler-free responses. To use it, you can highlight a passage in any book you&#39;ve bought or borrowed and ask it questions about plot, characters or other crucial details, and the AI assistant will offer &#34;immediate, contextual, spoiler-free information.&#34; You&#39;ll even be able to ask follow-up questions for more detail.
Amazon
While Ask this Book may be helpful to some Kindle readers, the feature touches on a major point of contention with authors and publishers. In response to Publishers Lunch, a daily newsletter for the publishing industry, an Amazon spokesperson said that, &#34;To ensure a consistent reading experience, the feature is always on, and there is no option for authors or publishers to opt titles out.&#34; Other AI companies are already facing lawsuits claiming copyright infringement. Most recently, the New York Times and Chicago Tribune sued Perplexity, accusing the AI company of using its copyrighted works to train its LLMs.
As for the Ask this Book feature, Amazon is already planning to expand it beyond the iOS app and will introduce it to Kindle devices and the Android OS app next year. Beyond this new feature, Amazon also introduced Recaps to Kindle devices and the iOS app for books in a series, which acts much like a TV show&#39;s &#34;Previously on&#34; roundup in between seasons. However, Amazon recently had to withdraw its AI-generated Video Recaps feature, so it might be worth double-checking the info you get from Recaps, too.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/kindles-in-book-ai-assistant-can-answer-all-your-questions-without-spoilers-190609961.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F98482f50-d91a-11f0-bf7f-e04ae053e943&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=34f61de1b446b5a7fc06af4177f3fb9da8a37806,https://www.engadget.com/ai/kindles-in-book-ai-assistant-can-answer-all-your-questions-without-spoilers-190609961.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-14T19:06:09Z,8,Tech

Ayaneo's first smartphone is a major callback to the Xperia Play,"Close enough, welcome back Xperia Play. After releasing a teaser video in early November, Ayaneo fully revealed its first smartphone called the Pocket Play. As suspected, the Ayaneo Pocket Play features a sliding mechanism that transforms it from a chunky smartphone into a gaming handheld.




In its gaming configuration, the Pocket Play features a controller setup with a D-pad, ABXY buttons and four shoulder buttons. However, Ayaneo has modernized the Xperia Play design by incorporating two touchpads, which will also be seen in the handheld maker&#39;s next flagship device called the Next II. According to Ayaneo, you can map these touchpads as virtual joysticks or customizable inputs. Ayaneo hasn&#39;t revealed the specs of the Pocket Play yet, but the device appears to have slots that could hint at expandable storage options.
The Pocket Play will be Ayaneo&#39;s first foray into the smartphone world, albeit with mobile gaming in mind. It&#39;ll have to compete against the likes of other gaming-specific smartphones like the Redmagic 10 Pro or the Asus ROG Phone series, as well as the latest iPhone and Samsung Galaxy smartphones that can also handle demanding mobile games. Ayaneo will launch the Pocket Play on Kickstarter soon, but hasn&#39;t revealed any pricing details yet.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/ayaneos-first-smartphone-is-a-major-callback-to-the-xperia-play-165206332.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F4b13d030-d90c-11f0-bdf9-a2148633c1bb&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=2c02de83c267a1d9da1d47cf132bf99c2490881b,https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/ayaneos-first-smartphone-is-a-major-callback-to-the-xperia-play-165206332.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-14T16:52:06Z,7,Tech

A AAA game for the Alien franchise is back in the works,"If Alien: Romulus reawakened your appetite for the iconic sci-fi franchise, the good news is that a promising video game could be on the way. According to an Insider Gaming report, a new game for the Alien franchise is back in development. The report&#39;s sources mentioned that the single-player game will be set in a &#34;decaying space station&#34; as an arcade survival horror that can be compared to &#34;Shadow of [the] Tomb Raider with Xenomorphs.&#34;
It&#39;s not the first time we heard about this Alien game, which was first reported on in 2022 under the codename &#34;Marathon.&#34; According to Insider Gaming, the game has cycled through several developers, but more recently landed with Eidos Montreal, which developed Shadow of the Tomb Raider and is currently working on the upcoming Fable reboot. The report added that the game&#39;s development budget was increased to less than $75 million, up from the initial $30 million budget from a few years ago.
Insider Gaming&#39;s report noted that the game is still in &#34;early development,&#34; but could feature Ripley 8, the human-Xenomorph hybrid that was first seen in Alien Resurrection. The game&#39;s details and release date are still subject to change, but Insider Gaming&#39;s sources said the game is &#34;in a good place at this point&#34; and is expected to release in 2028 on all platforms. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/a-aaa-game-for-the-alien-franchise-is-back-in-the-works-204401214.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F5a414660-d861-11f0-9ff5-769969fe9a00&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=2e0e731e61b54bad097d94c1198be7bea2995af2,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/a-aaa-game-for-the-alien-franchise-is-back-in-the-works-204401214.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-13T20:44:01Z,7,Tech

Half-Life 3 is rumored to be a Steam Machine launch title and could arrive in spring 2026,"Half-Life fans are nothing if not patient. For the diehard fans out there, the latest test of patience comes from Insider Gaming Weekly&#39;s podcast, which claimed that the third installment in the Half-Life franchise is set to release with the launch of the Steam Machine sometime in spring 2026.
&#34;The window I was specifically told was spring 2026 for the Steam Machine, for the Frame, for the Controller, for Half-Life 3,&#34; Mike Straw, one of the hosts of the Insider Gaming Weekly podcast and senior editor at Insider Gaming, said. &#34;At the end of the day, the game is real.&#34;
Straw added that all the previous dates for an announcement of the next Half-Life game have passed, but that his sources &#34;are still adamant this is a game that will be a launch title with the Steam Machine.&#34; However, being tied to Valve&#39;s latest hardware release could be an issue since Straw noted that the explosive jump in RAM pricing is causing considerable concern for the Steam Machine&#39;s pricing announcement.
&#34;There is a concern, however, they haven&#39;t made a decision on price, which is kind of holding back the announcement of anything else,&#34; Straw said. &#34;There&#39;s no doubt in my mind Valve is still trying to make decisions because of what&#39;s going on on the component side.&#34;
While optimistic devotees were hoping for some teasers during The Game Awards, Valve hasn&#39;t officially said anything. However, there&#39;s still a lot of hope, especially considering Valve updated Half-Life 2 for its 20th anniversary, and previous rumors hinted at a game that&#39;s still in development but is playable from beginning to end. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/half-life-3-is-rumored-to-be-a-steam-machine-launch-title-and-could-arrive-in-spring-2026-193029413.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2Fd7e93c30-d852-11f0-bd7f-b3d180e76c4a&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=4bbf3cef5b9ade8a78b5ac9175dcc01e1a78e3b4,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/half-life-3-is-rumored-to-be-a-steam-machine-launch-title-and-could-arrive-in-spring-2026-193029413.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-13T19:30:29Z,9,Tech

It also introduces new controls for how Liquid Glass appears on the Lock Screen, adding a slider to adjust the transparency level. The drop also includes updates for iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, visionOS and tvOS.
What&#39;s new in iOS 26.2 and iPadOS 26.2
It&#39;s not exactly a major update feature-wise, but iOS and iPadOS 26.2 bring a bunch of quality of life improvements to apps including Apple Music, Podcasts and Games. In Apple Music, you&#39;ll now see your Favorite Songs playlist in the Top Picks section, and lyrics will be available offline for songs you&#39;ve downloaded. In addition to automatically generated chapters, Podcasts will display links to any other podcasts mentioned in the episode you&#39;re listening to. And, Games is getting in-game score banners, along with filters for the library to make it easier to find titles based on category and other descriptors. Apple says it also improved support for Backbone and Razer controllers.
With iOS 26.2, Apple made Safety Alerts for natural disasters and other emergencies more detailed, and they&#39;ll now come with maps of affected areas and other useful information. For iPad users, Apple has added drag-and-drop gestures for its new windowing system to make multitasking smoother. The update for iPhones and iPads also addresses several potential security issues, including vulnerabilities in WebKit that Apple says &#34;may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals on versions of iOS before iOS 26.&#34; So, if you&#39;re not yet running the latest OS on your iPhone and iPad, it&#39;s a good time to update. 
OS updates for the rest of the family
Beyond the iPhone and iPad, macOS Tahoe 26.2 introduces Edge Light for Mac, which turns your display into a ring light for video calls. For the Apple Watch, 26.2 fixes an issue with stuck songs in the Music app, and adds some new controls for the Sleep app. The tvOS update brings the option to add profiles even for people who don&#39;t have an Apple Account, and new restriction options for kid profiles. With visionOS 26.2, Travel Mode now has settings for cars and buses, and you&#39;ll now be able to use spatial accessories including &#34;Logitech Muse in Notes, Freeform, and any PencilKit-enabled app&#34; to create hand-drawn content with the Apple Vision Pro.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ios-262-is-here-with-another-liquid-glass-tweak-new-podcasts-features-and-more-181020133.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F8b4a2920-d84d-11f0-b77a-4cba8f75fe45&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=41116c21194527d0d4aa0ff38d3d616300580f89,https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ios-262-is-here-with-another-liquid-glass-tweak-new-podcasts-features-and-more-181020133.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-13T18:10:20Z,13,Tech
CRKD's Nitro Deck 2 works for both the Nintendo Switch and Switch 2,"Even though Nintendo made some serious upgrades with the Joy-Con 2, you still might end up ditching them for CRKD&#39;s Nitro Deck 2. After winning over Nintendo Switch owners with its first Nitro Deck, CRKD followed it up with an improved design that works for both the original Switch and the Switch 2. 
To refine the original design, CRKD added several upgrades to the Nitro Deck 2 based on community feedback. The new-and-improved accessory features the company&#39;s CaptiStick Technology, which prevents stick drift and isn&#39;t affected by magnetic interference like other Hall effect joysticks. CRKD also offset the right thumbstick and contoured the outer shell for a more ergonomic feel. The Nitro Deck 2 is keeping the swappable stick top feature, but CRKD added the ability to swap out the D-Pad for even more customizability. At the back of the Nitro Deck 2, CRKD managed to squeeze in extra L2 and R2 shoulder buttons alongside the programmable back buttons, which were first seen with the predecessor.

Even if you don&#39;t own a Switch 2 yet, the Nitro Deck 2 features a new retractable locking mechanism that can be adjusted to fit both the original Switch and Switch OLED. The Nitro Deck 2 supports a low-latency wired mode thanks to an included adapter, but you can also connect the devices through Bluetooth. Thanks to its wireless connection, the Nitro Deck 2 even works as a controller with PC, mobile or smart TVs. 

  
The Nitro Deck 2 will release in white and smoke black, starting at $99.99. That&#39;s a $30 increase from the original Nitro Deck&#39;s price tag when it debuted in 2023. CRKD will also offer a carrying case for $39.99 and additional D-Pad and Stick Top packs for $19.99. Nitro Deck 2 is currently available for preorders on CRKD&#39;s website and is expected to start shipping in spring 2026.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/crkds-nitro-deck-2-works-for-both-the-nintendo-switch-and-switch-2-173920127.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2Fadf648e0-d844-11f0-be95-038ea8994280&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=5a2a4cb8057a3a6a95ae0402b5d9bbd467735c72,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/crkds-nitro-deck-2-works-for-both-the-nintendo-switch-and-switch-2-173920127.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-13T17:39:20Z,7,Tech

Microsoft flips security script: ‘In scope by default’ makes all vulnerabilities fair game for bug bounties,"
		
					  
						




Today’s AI-enabled attackers are agnostic: They’re not limiting themselves to specific companies, products, or services — they’re going where the vulnerabilities are. To meet them on this ground, Microsoft is pivoting its cybersecurity strategy to what it calls ‘In Scope by Default.’



Now, any “critical vulnerability” with a “demonstrable impact” on Microsoft’s online services is eligible for a bounty award. This applies to code owned and managed by Microsoft, as well as to anything delivered by a third party or via open-source.



Threat actors “don’t care who owns the code they try to exploit,” Tom Gallagher, VP of engineering at the Microsoft Security Response Center, wrote in a blog post announcing the new security policy. “The same approach should apply to the security community who continue to partner with us to provide critical insights that help protect our customers.”



Goal to ‘incentivize research’



‘In Scope by Default’ was announced at Black Hat Europe on Friday, with Gallagher saying that Microsoft “will do whatever it takes” to remediate surfaced issues.



This strategic shift comes as attackers continuously up their game, aided by AI tools. Microsoft was recently impacted by a zero-day vulnerability in SharePoint that trickled down to businesses and government agencies alike, and in October, the company’s own security update triggered a range of failures. And just today, to plug the gap until Microsoft can develop its own fix, free unofficial patches were made available by a third party for a newly-discovered Windows zero-day vulnerability that gives attackers the ability to crash the Remote Access Connection Manager (RasMan) service.



Microsoft has employed a range of tactics to combat these threats. Gallagher pointed out that, in 2024, the company awarded more than $17 million through its bug bounty program and live hacking events, and its strategy pivot will expand award eligibility. Rather than only being offered for bugs in defined scopes, issues with all online services will be included by default, and as soon as the services are released.



“Our goal is to incentivize research on the highest risk areas, especially the areas that threat actors are most likely to exploit,” said Gallagher.



Eligibility will now include:




Microsoft-owned domains and cloud services. Security researchers without Microsoft insider perspective will be encouraged to target its infrastructures via agreed upon rules of engagement.



Third-party code, including open source. In cases where no bug bounty exists in this area, Microsoft will now offer one. Identifying vulnerabilities in third-party code can help raise the bar for “everyone who relies on this code,” Gallagher noted.




This shift is “quite significant,” particularly for a company of Microsoft’s size, noted Erik Avakian, technical counselor at Info-Tech Research Group. The new default inclusion policy is backed by process and governance, and is being applied across the tech giant’s “massive, heterogeneous ecosystem.”



“Microsoft is explicitly pulling third-party and open-source dependencies into scope when they impact Microsoft services, which reflects how real attacks actually traverse shared infrastructure rather than clean product boundaries,” said Avakian.



Researchers are welcome to submit their findings for assessment and for coordinated disclosure, the practice of privately reporting vulnerabilities to vendors so that they can diagnose and fix issues before they are announced publicly.



Microsoft and its partners follow the Rules of Engagement for Responsible Security Research, Gallagher noted, which encourages a variety of red teaming activities, such as performing vulnerability assessments on Azure virtual machines (VMs), testing surge capacity, attempting to break out of system boundaries and shared service containers, testing security monitoring and detection systems, and evaluating conditional access.



However, these rules of engagement prohibit red teamers from using or accessing credentials that aren’t their own, launching phishing attacks against Microsoft employees, performing denial-of-service testing or other testing that generates excessive traffic, or interacting with storage accounts not included in a user’s own subscription.



Pros and cons to the approach



This widening of scope isn’t necessarily new, noted Info-Tech’s Avakian, though cloud service providers (CSPs), financial institutions, and SaaS companies publish narrower scope language and handle many cases through back-channel negotiation. But much of this still relies heavily on researcher goodwill and internal judgment calls.



Microsoft’s wider scope is a bit different, and could result in fewer gray-area arguments and the “is this in scope?” back-and-forth questioning that can expend time and create friction with researchers, said Avakian. It also provides better signaling: If people don’t fear disqualification, they’re more likely to submit early-stage findings. This is great for defenders and can foster stronger trust in the research community.



“It helps send a clear message: ‘We want to hear about problems,’ and internally, it forces ownership,” said Avakian. “Once something’s in scope by default, it helps to force maturity.”



However, this could get difficult when it comes to volume, potentially leading to more low-quality reports and speculative or “nebulous” findings, he said. Engineering teams can burn out quickly if everything is treated as urgent, or if severity isn’t well-communicated.



“But this model can work if severity discipline is rock solid,” said Avakian.



However, attackers could benefit indirectly if defender teams become overloaded, where potential noise could drown out real signals, and fix velocity could slow due to triage backlogs. “In other words, operational drag could very well become the attacker’s friend,” said Avakian.



Researchers, for their part, might go down unconventional attack path rabbit holes, and less ethical hackers may spray “low-effort findings” at scale and use ambiguity to pressure for bounty money or even publicly frame rejections as Microsoft ignoring security, he noted.



Ultimately, “scope is really a governance decision,” said Avakian, pointing out that enterprises fall behind when vulnerability programs are still written primarily to reduce payouts, minimize exposure, and protect brand optics.



“Microsoft is signaling that operational clarity beats defensive ambiguity,” said Avakian. However, “in scope by default” only works with maturity behind it.



“If you don’t already have strong governance, triage processes, consistent severity models, and engineering accountability, it becomes problematic,” he said. “Automation, enrichment, and experienced human judgment matter more than ever here, and Microsoft appears to be clearly investing in that long game.”

Leaked Home Depot credential exposed internal systems for a year,"
		
					  
						




Home Depot exposed access to internal systems for a year, TechCrunch reports.



According to security researcher Ben Zimmermann, a Home Depot employee published a private GitHub access token sometime in early 2024, likely by mistake.



Zimmerman told TechCrunch that when he tested the token, it granted access to private Home Depot repos on GitHub, with write permissions, as well as access to the company’s cloud infrastructure, including order fulfillment and inventory management systems. 



Zimmerman, who told TechCrunch he has disclosed similar exposures to other companies, said he did not get a response to several emails he sent to Home Depot about the leaked credential.



“Home Depot is the only company that ignored me,” he said.



The leaked credential has since been removed from public view after TechCrunch contacted the company last week.

Amazon pulls its bad AI video recaps after Fallout fallout,"Amazon has responded to viewers catching errors in its AI-generated season recaps by apparently pulling them from Prime Video. The company announced its new Video Recaps feature in November as a way to make it easier to jump into a new season of a show, but the feature had issues: A recap created for Fallout included factual errors about the plot and the setting of the show.On Prime Video, recaps can be played in the &#34;Extras&#34; section if you&#39;re watching on the web, or via a dedicated &#34;recap button&#34; on the show&#39;s page, according to Amazon&#39;s original Video Recaps announcement. If you head to the Fallout  season two page now, the erroneous recap has been removed. In fact, at least on the web, there are currently no video recaps available on the show&#39;s Amazon was testing the feature on, which includes Fallout, Bosch, Upload, The Rig and Tom Clancy&#39;s Jack Ryan.Engadget has contacted Amazon for more information on why the recaps were removed. We&#39;ll update this article if we hear back.Video Recaps are just one of the ways Amazon is trying to integrate AI into its different products and services. The company offered AI-generated English dubs for select anime shows on Prime Video, before it pulled the dubs after users complained. Amazon also uses AI to generate recaps for long-running book series that are sold through the Kindle Store.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/amazon-pulls-its-bad-ai-video-recaps-after-fallout-fallout-220358758.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2024-11%2F461ab810-9ae1-11ef-bf67-1e6d158a25f8&resize=1400%2C783&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=5b32f9e10f3b512df617f16520ee7fe652fbc5e2,https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/amazon-pulls-its-bad-ai-video-recaps-after-fallout-fallout-220358758.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-12T22:03:58Z,8,Tech

IKEA's new wireless charger is as cute as it is practical,"IKEA&#39;s revamp of its smart home products doesn&#39;t end with Matter support. The furniture and home goods company also has a line of new Qi wireless chargers, the best of which, the VÄSTMÄRKE wireless charger, combines the functionality of a PopSockets-style phone grip with cable storage.The $10 VÄSTMÄRKE wireless charger is reminiscent of a bagel or donut, if you could take the top half of those ring-shaped foods and turn them inside out to create a cozy grip for your fingers. That same red silicone design also makes for a perfect place to store the charger&#39;s built-in USB-C cable, according to IKEA&#39;s product page, and otherwise acts as a playful replacement for what can be a pretty boring smartphone accessory.A VÄSTMÄRKE wireless charger with its top half unfolded so fingers can grip it.IKEAVÄSTMÄRKE offers Qi2 charging speeds and can magnetically attach to iPhones with MagSafe or Pixel phones with Google&#39;s Pixelsnap magnets. If you&#39;re interested in something a bit more discrete, the $25 VÄSTMÄRKE wireless charger with lighting is a bowl-shaped charger with a column in the center for attaching a smartphone, and room around it for keys or your wallet.IKEA has had multiple different ideas over the years for how smart home tech should integrate with its minimalist and user-friendly furniture. The company&#39;s partnership with Sonos ended in May 2025, which produced lights and picture frames with smart speakers built-in. Since then, the company has announced a new Bluetooth speaker and started rolling out a new collection of Matter-connected remotes, lights and sensors.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/ikeas-new-wireless-charger-is-as-cute-as-it-is-practical-195013422.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2FIkea-wireless-charger-2.jpg&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=762717fdc3394491f1633f6b2c6f68e7a154f2f4,https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/ikeas-new-wireless-charger-is-as-cute-as-it-is-practical-195013422.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-12T19:50:13Z,2,Tech

Google Translate is now better at translating slang terms and idioms using AI,"Google is rolling out new Gemini-assisted functionality to Search and its Translate app. It says its AI can now provide more natural and accurate text translations for phrases that have more &#34;nuanced meanings.&#34;  Translate will now take slang terms and colloquial expressions into consideration rather than provide sometimes unhelpful direct translations.
The latest update to its text translation feature is rolling out first in the US and India, translating between English and just under 20 other languages, including German, Spanish, Chinese and Arabic. It works in the Translate app for iOS and Android and on the web.
Gemini’s speech-to-speech translation feature has also been updated, so you can now hear real-time translations in your headphones, like with Apple’s AirPods Pro 3. Google says the new functionality, which is now in beta in the Translate app for Android (iOS is coming next year) in the US, tries to &#34;preserve the tone, emphasis and cadence of each speaker&#34; so you better understand the direction of the conversation and who said what. It works with any headphones and supports more than 70 languages.
Finally, Google is adding more tools to its potentially Duolingo-rivaling AI-powered language learning tools, which it introduced to the Translate app in August. Like Duolingo, Translate can now track how many days in a row you’ve been attempting to learn a new language, so you can check your progress over time. Whether it will nag you as persistently as the Duolingo owl famously does for slacking off is not clear.
The feedback feature has also been improved, so you should receive more useful tips on how you’re pronouncing words or phrases. Germany, India and Sweden are among the 20 new countries that can now use these educational tools.
After not showing it much love for a while, Google has been busy adding new features to Translate recently. As well as the new language practice feature, an update last month added the ability to select between &#34;Fast&#34; and &#34;Advanced&#34; translations that allow you to prioritize speed when you’re in a rush (ordering a drink at the bar, for example) or receiving more accurate translations using Gemini.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/google-translate-is-now-better-at-translating-slang-terms-and-idioms-using-ai-173428316.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F64e36280-d77e-11f0-b7c7-04a7be0708db&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=d5cdbc709abd8bacf0320a861e9e77a0a00cfcce,https://www.engadget.com/apps/google-translate-is-now-better-at-translating-slang-terms-and-idioms-using-ai-173428316.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-12T17:34:28Z,9,Tech

"Doom studio id Software forms 'wall-to-wall' union, with 165 employees voting in favor","Id Software, the company behind Doom, has voted in favor of forming a &#34;wall-to-wall&#34; union. The term &#34;wall-to-wall&#34; refers to a union that includes every employee, regardless of duties. The vote wasn&#39;t unanimous, with 165 of 185 total employees in favor of the union.
The union will work in conjunction with the Communications Workers of America (CWA), which is the same organization involved with parent company ZeniMax&#39;s recent unionization efforts. Microsoft, who owns ZeniMax, has already recognized this new effort, according to a statement by the CWA. It agreed to a labor neutrality agreement with the CWA and ZeniMax workers last year, paving the way for this sort of thing.
&#34;The wall-to-wall organizing effort at id Software was much needed; it’s incredibly important that developers across the industry unite to push back on all the unilateral workplace changes that are being handed down from industry executives,&#34; id Software producer and CWA committee member Andrew Willis wrote in a statement to Engadget.
From the onset, this union will look to protect remote work for id Software employees. &#34;Remote work isn’t a perk. It’s a necessity for our health, our families, and our access needs. RTO policies should not be handed down from executives with no consideration for accessibility or our well-being,” said id Software Lead Services Programmer Chris Hays. He also said he looks forward to getting worker protections regarding the &#34;responsible use of AI.&#34;
Workers at id began organizing around 18 months ago, according to a report by Aftermath. Things sped up after Microsoft closed several Bethesda studios in the middle of last year.
&#34;We look forward to sitting across the table from Microsoft to negotiate a contract that reflects the skill, creativity and dedication these workers bring to every project,&#34; said CWA Local 6215 President Ron Swaggerty.

The best iPad deals this week include the iPad Air M3 for $150 off,"We generally consider Apple’s iPads to be the best tablets for most people, but they usually don’t come cheap. To help those looking to grab one get the most value possible, we’re keeping an eye on sale prices and rounding up the best iPad deals we can find each week. 
This week’s highlights include both versions of the latest iPad Air for $150 off at Amazon, matching the all-time lows we last saw around Black Friday. The iPad mini and iPad Pro are each $100 off as well. Beyond iPads, both the AirPods Pro 3 and Apple Watch Series 11 are even cheaper than they were last month, and there are still decent drops for the AirPods 4, Apple Watch SE 3 and MacBook Air. Here are the best Apple deals from this week that we can find. 
Best iPad deals 

  
Apple iPad Air (13-inch, M3) for $650 ($149 off MSRP): The 13-inch iPad Air is exactly the same as its smaller counterpart, only it has a larger and slightly brighter display. We gave it a review score of 89 earlier this year. This is another all-time low, but again, make sure to clip the coupon on Amazon&#39;s product page to see the full discount. 
Apple iPad mini (A17 Pro) for $399 ($100 off): The iPad mini is exactly what it sounds like: the smaller iPad. This latest iteration adds an improved A17 Pro chip, 128GB of storage in the base model and Apple Pencil Pro support. As always, you’d buy it if you value the smaller 8.3-inch display and want a tablet that’s easier to use with one hand. This discount is $50 more than the all-time low we saw around Cyber Monday but still $100 less than buying directly from Apple. Also at Amazon. 
Apple iPad Pro (11-inch, M5) for $899 ($100 off): The latest iPad Pro is still more tablet than most people will ever need, but its class-leading OLED display, impressively thin design and super-powerful M5 chip make it a luxury experience for those who can afford it. The device was only released in October, so this deal ties its lowest price to date. Also at Best Buy and B&amp;H. 
Apple iPad Pro (13-inch, M5) for $1,199 ($100 off): It’s not a massive discount, but this matches the lowest price so far for the larger iPad Pro, which may be worthwhile if you’ve got cash to burn and want to use an iPad as your main computer. We gave it a score of 85 in our review. Also at B&amp;H. 
Best Apple deals 

  
Apple AirPods 4 for $74 ($55 off): If you don&#39;t need active noise cancellation and hate the feeling of headphones that just into your ear canal, the standard AirPods 4 remain a good buy. They lack built-in volume controls, and no open-style earbuds can produce the same level of bass as typical in-ear headphones, but they generally sound more pleasant than most pairs along these lines and still offer the usual array of Apple-friendly features. This discount is only $5 more than the all-time low we saw around Black Friday. Also at Best Buy for $85 if that runs out of stock. 
Apple AirPods 4 with ANC for $99 ($80 off): This version of the AirPods 4 adds active noise cancellation, a wireless charging case and Find My tracking support on top of the many other iPhone-friendly features included with any set of Apple headphones. It still has an open-back design, so the ANC isn’t as effective as what you’d get with a pair that fully seals off your ear canal, but it’s useful all the same. We gave it a score of 86 in our review. This deal matches the pair’s all-time lowest price.  

  
Apple Watch SE 3 for $199 ($50 off): This discount has been around for a few weeks, but it’s the lowest price to date for Apple’s newest entry-level smartwatch. We gave the SE 3 a score of 90 in our review last month: The big upgrade is an always-on display, which makes it so you no longer have to wake the watch to check the time or notifications. It still includes most of the essential health and fitness features beyond that, plus it now runs on the same chipset as the higher-end Apple Watch Series 11. Also at Walmart. 
Apple Pencil Pro for $95 ($34 off): The Pencil Pro is Apple’s most feature-rich stylus, offering pressure sensitivity, wireless charging, haptic feedback and unique gesture controls compared to the standard USB-C model (which isn’t significantly discounted). Just note that it’s not compatible with the entry-level iPad and other older models. While this discount is only $5 below the device’s usual street price, it’s still the largest discount we’ve seen this year. Also at Walmart. 

  
Apple Mac mini (M4) for $479 ($120 off): The latest iteration of Apple’s tiny desktop PC has a smaller footprint, a faster M4 chip, 16GB of RAM by default, two front-facing USB-C ports and an extra Thunderbolt 4 port. It can also drive three external displays, though it lacks USB-A ports entirely. We gave a higher-end model with Apple’s M4 Pro chip a score of 90 in our review. This deal on the base model with an M4 chip, 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage is $10 more than the best deal we&#39;ve seen but $20 less than the config&#39;s typical street price.

Gladinet servers file-sharing servers allow remote code execution,"
		
					  
						




Enterprises relying on Gladinet’s file-sharing services are faced with another round of zero-day patching, this time to block attackers from abusing cryptographic keys directly baked into its CentreStack and Triofox platforms.



Cybersecurity firm Huntress warned that attackers are already abusing the hardcoded keys to perform remote code execution (RCE) on the affected servers.



“The AES implementation of Gladinet’s CentreStack and Triofox products contains hardcoded cryptographic keys,” Huntress researchers said in a blog post. “We are seeing attackers target this flaw across our customer base.”



As with any internet facing server, remote code execution on CentreStack or Triofox can potentially lead to malware deployment, backdoor persistence, and credential theft. Huntress urged all CentreStack/Triofox customers to update to the latest version, 16.12.10420.56791, saying nine of its enterprise customers had already been affected.



Hardcoded keys, harder consequences



At the core of the issue is a design failure in how CentreStack and Triofox generate the cryptographic keys used to encrypt the access tokens the platforms uses to control who can retrieve what files. Huntress found that the server relies on a function called “GenerateSecKey()” to produce the AES key and initialization vector (IV) for ticket encryption — but instead of generating unique values, the function returns the same static 100-byte strings every time the service runs.



“Because the keys never change, we could extract them from memory once and use them to decrypt any ticket generated by the server or worse, encrypt our own,” the researchers said, adding that the keys were static strings of Chinese and Japanese text.



With that ability, an adversary can request any file the server is capable of serving, including the sensitive “web.config” file that contains the ASP.NET machine key.



With the machine key in hand, attackers can generate malicious ViewState payloads that the server will trust, enabling remote code execution through ASP.NET deserialization. Deserialization attacks leverage unsafe parsing of serialized objects (like ViewState in ASP.NET) to inject malicious payloads that run with the privilege of the web service.



Patch now



Huntress identified multiple active attacks with the threat actor first attempting to exploit CVE-2025-11371, a previously disclosed unauthenticated Local File Inclusion bug in CentreStack/ Triofox, followed by the new exploit. Both allowed attackers to obtain the web.config file containing the machine key.



No pre-requisites such as valid credentials or privileged access are needed for a successful attack beyond knowledge of the default keys. To mitigate the risk, Huntress urged all customers to update immediately to the latest builds released by Gladinet on December 8, as these contain fixes for the insecure cryptography.



Where immediate patching isn’t feasible, configuration changes to replace machine keys with randomized values can reduce risk until updates are deployed. Additionally, the huntress team shared the encrypted GET request for web.config as an indicator of compromise (IOC).



Gladinet has previously failed to completely patching a similar hardcoded-keys flaw as criminals found a way to revive exploit conditions on patched systems.

Reddit sues Australia over underage social media ban,"Reddit has filed a lawsuit in Australia&#39;s High Court aiming to overturn the country&#39;s under-16 social media ban, Reuters reported. The forum platform called the law contrary to Australia&#39;s constitution as it intrudes on free political discourse. It also argued that Reddit shouldn&#39;t have been included in the ban since it isn&#39;t a social media site, based on the law&#39;s definition. The action is likely to set in motion a protracted legal battle, given Reddit&#39;s resources and its popularity in Australia
Australia&#39;s minimum age social media ban, the first of its kind in the world, went into effect on December 10. The ten platforms affected, including Reddit, must bar underage users or face a fine of up to A$49.5 million ($33 million). Platforms are using a variety of means to determine age, including age inference based on activity and selfies.
However Reddit argued that the law comes with some &#34;serious privacy and political expression issues&#34; for users. &#34;Australian citizens under the age of 16 will, within years if not months, become electors. The choices to be made by those citizens will be informed by political communication in which they engage prior to the age of 18,&#34; it wrote in the filing.
The government disagreed, noting that Reddit filed the lawsuit to protect is profits, not children&#39;s right to free expression. &#34;It is action we saw time and time again by Big Tobacco against tobacco control and we are seeing it now by some social media or big tech giants,&#34; said Health Minister Mark Butler. 
With a market capitalization of $44 billion, Reddit certainly has the means to sustain a long fight. It would be motivated to do so as well, given that Australia is its fourth-largest market after Canada, the UK and the United States.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/reddit-sues-australia-over-underage-social-media-ban-143018208.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F034b2320-d740-11f0-be65-d2b4411fa937&resize=1400%2C1050&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=508fd10037856d15977a0484e8c0c172660fefef,https://www.engadget.com/social-media/reddit-sues-australia-over-underage-social-media-ban-143018208.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-12T14:30:18Z,7,Tech

The Apple Watch Series 11 is $100 off and cheaper than ever,"If you&#39;re still on the hunt for gifts, or simply good holiday deals for yourself, you can find them on the internet. Just because Black Friday and Cyber Monday have ended doesn&#39;t mean the deals have dried up. One of the best deals available that we&#39;re tracking is on the latest Apple Watch Series 11, which you can get for a record low of $299.  

  
We gave the Apple Watch Series 11 a score of 90 when it came out in September. That&#39;s thanks, in part, to an upgraded 24 hours of battery life — which lasted closer to a day and a half — compared to the 18 hours promised by the Series 10. It also features a thin, light design and a wrist flick gesture for everything from dismissing a notification to ending calls. Plus, it has Apple&#39;s new hypertension tracker and comprehensive health monitoring.  
This deal is available for the Apple Watch Series 11 with a 42mm case and a small to medium band. Also on sale right now in the Apple Watch space is the Apple Watch SE 3, which is down to $199.

F1: The Movie now streaming on Apple TV following a long theatrical run,"F1: The Movie, the cinematic love letter to Formula One and — quite possibly even more so — consumer products made by Apple, is finally available to stream on Apple TV if you’re a subscriber. It follows the sports thriller’s long theatrical run, during which it raked in more than $630 million globally, comfortably making it Apple’s most successful original film.
Directed by Joseph Kosinski (Top Gun: Maverick, Tron: Legacy), F1: The Movie follows the washed-up former F1 prodigy Sonny Hayes (Brad Pitt), who is convinced by an old friend (Javier Bardem) to get back in the driver&#39;s seat and help rescue his failing team. Seven-time F1 world champion Lewis Hamilton served as a producer on the film to ensure it represented the sport as authentically as possible.
Engadget’s Devindra Hardawar reviewed F1: The Movie when it arrived in theatres in the summer, calling it a &#34;shameless Apple ad that will blow your socks off.&#34; Should you manage to keep your eyes from rolling straight out of their sockets when a pair of AirPods Max appear on screen before anyone says a word, then a deliriously entertaining blockbuster awaits. 
For all of the film’s formulaic storytelling and generic characters, the Really Fast Car bits are so well done that they put F1: The Movie among the very best racing movies, as far as our reviewer is concerned. In truth, it’s the kind of film that deserves to be seen on the biggest screen you can find, but failing that, the TV in your living room should do the job just fine, too.
Apple recently dropped the &#34;+&#34; from its streaming service’s name, so it’s now just called Apple TV (yes, the same name as one of its products). If you’re a new subscriber you can take advantage of a seven-day free trial, after which it costs $13 per month following a recent price hike.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/f1-the-movie-now-streaming-on-apple-tv-following-a-long-theatrical-run-133531702.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2Faec817b0-d75b-11f0-bf7e-deb8d538b7fe&resize=1400%2C738&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=7a5f97049dec8167d8cae3a64241fc25843ce52c,https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/f1-the-movie-now-streaming-on-apple-tv-following-a-long-theatrical-run-133531702.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-12T13:35:31Z,8,Tech
"In 2025, AI and EVs gave the US an insatiable hunger for power","You may be surprised to learn electricity only accounts for 21 percent of the world’s energy consumption. Fossil fuels and the rest all play their part to make the world go around, but their role is likely to diminish no matter what happens. The International Energy Agency believes electricity’s share of global energy consumption is going to double in the next decade alone. You all know the causes: Electrification, EVs, data centers and AI mean the planet needs to dramatically increase its power generation, transmission and storage capacity. It’s a shame, then, that the world is nowhere near ready to satisfy such an outrageous surge in demand. Re-learning to love the atomThe US has certainly spent the year opening doors to dramatically increase domestic energy production. Part of that has to give the signal that the US will embrace nuclear power in ways it hasn’t for generations. This January, an executive order titled Unleashing American Energy included an instruction for the government to eliminate rules and regulations related to power generation. Its primary focus was to destroy environmental regulations limiting the extraction of oil, natural gas and coal, but also to remove roadblocks to the construction of new nuclear plants. Then, in May, a subsequent order declared a desire to ensure the deployment of “advanced nuclear technologies.” As the driving force behind the AI push, big tech has made some high profile moves to buy up extra generation capacity. Meta signed a 20-year deal with Constellation to own the output of the Clinton Power Station, preserving the 1.1GW facility once its state tax credit expires next year. Microsoft has its own 20-year deal with Constellation to own the power generated by reactor 1 at Three Mile Island, now renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center. On November 18, that project was also given the backing of the Department of Energy which authorized a $1 billion loan. But even without the backing of big tech, other mothballed reactors are being restarted, like the Palisades plant in Michigan. Earlier this year, the Department of Energy handed out a $1.52 billion loan to get the facility, capable of generating 800MW, back up and running. Big tech is also betting on the future of nuclear power, signing deals with a number of startups looking to build out a new generation of reactors. Google, for instance, has backed Kairos Power and its plan to build a series of small, modular reactors. Amazon, meanwhile, invested in X-Energy and has published plans for its own buildout in Washington State. It’s not just the US that is learning to fall back in love with nuclear power, as the rest of the world is also building out new capacity. The World Nuclear Association says there are 70 reactors currently under construction across 15 countries. Russia, India, Argentina, Turkey, South Korea, Japan, and Brazil, to name just a few, are all working on new reactors. China on its own is presently building 33 reactors and, as Nuclear Business Platform reported earlier this year, greenlit a further 10 this April. That same report adds that China’s policy of producing multiple reactors at a time has seen costs crater. It says that while the UK’s two new reactors at Hinkley Point will cost in excess of $60 billion, each of these new reactors will cost $2.7 billion. Bridging the nuclear gapcoal handling in a portIndigo Division via Getty ImagesBuilding a nuclear reactor is not a swift process, and construction of a facility can take the better part of a decade. You can add on a few more years if you include the necessary procedural steps that need to be undertaken before a single piece of concrete is poured. Consequently, any major shift in the US’ power generation fleet will be measured in generations, rather than years. It’s a concern that, for all of the attention nuclear power is getting, it’s merely a smokescreen for a renewed push for fossil fuel extraction.After all, one major casualty from the Big, Beautiful Bill was the eradication of subsidies for the US’ solar industry. As we reported back in July, the act has kicked the legs out from domestic solar panel manufacturing, handing renewable energy dominance to China. This goes hand in hand with the US Department of Energy setting up a $625 million funding stream to revive America’s coal industry and recommission old power plants. Or that it is also awarding contracts to grow America’s strategic petroleum reserve. Back in September, Energy Secretary Chris Wright made the implausible claim to BBC News that fossil fuel extraction was nothing to worry about as fusion power would be on the grid in the next decade. Wright, himself the former CEO of fracking company Liberty Energy, was taken to task by a number of climate experts for publishing a report riddled with “misleading or fundamentally incorrect” assertions. Similarly, on November 20, the Department of Energy reshuffled its org chart to eliminate several departments responsible for renewable energy and energy efficiency while forming the Office of Fusion. Solar’s unstoppable riseThis stunning aerial view captures an  array of solar panels arranged in neat, parallel rows across the landscape. From above, the panels shimmer under the bright sunlight, creating a striking contrast against the natural terrain below. The organized rows of solar panels stretch across acres of land, symbolizing the growing global shift toward renewable energy. The grid-like pattern highlights the efficiency and scale of modern solar farms, contributing to sustainable energy production.This high-resolution image showcases the incredible reach and potential of solar power as a clean, renewable energy source. Whether situated in rural fields, expansive deserts, or atop rooftops, these solar panels represent a major step toward reducing carbon footprints and combating climate change. The solar farm&#39;s orderly rows and reflective surfaces create a visually appealing scene, demonstrating both technological innovation and environmental responsibility.Diane Keough via Getty ImagesThe US may have kneecapped its domestic solar industry, but it may not be enough to defeat renewables’ momentum. In October, the International Energy Agency projected renewable energy will grow by 4.6 TW by 2030 — a figure equal to the combined generation capacity of China, the EU and Japan combined. 77 percent of that figure is expected to come from solar power alone, despite the loss of subsidies in the US and less favorable circumstances in China. The domestic US forecast has been revised downward significantly as a consequence of its policy choices. But despite this, the obvious benefits of solar power haven’t gone away even if the price may be higher than it was at the start of the year. It remains the fastest and cheapest way to add new power in many countries, and can be installed on a grid or individual basis. Not to mention its utility in remote areas with poor generation resources, where it can reduce dependency on fossil fuels. This year, clean energy think-tank Ember reported on the growth of solar power in the last decade, and how it went from adding just one percent of global power generation in 2015 to 8.8 percent in the first half of 2025.“AI demand for electricity is the macro driver of US made solar,” said Rob Gardner, VP at the Solar Manufacturers for America Coalition. “AI investments can’t deliver expected returns without quickly deployed power, and US solar is the fastest and cheapest to deploy,” he said. Gardner cited a recent FERC forecast which predicts that 92.6GW of solar will come online between now and July 2028. The dream of fusionConstruction inside the reactor of ITER.ITERThe US is pinning a lot of its hopes on fusion power to wipe away the debt of our fossil fuel past. Earlier this year, the Department of Energy released a roadmap to get fusion out of the lab and into the world. It wants to coordinate the remaining resources of the federal government to close the fusion world’s “critical science, materials and technology gaps.” In the next three years, officials have been tasked with designing facilities for reactors and developing sources of fuel. Within the next decade, it’s hoped the government will be able to offer large-scale fuel cycle plants to help private sector plants start operations.If fusion power can be harnessed, it has many of the same upsides as nuclear fission with a lot fewer downsides. If nuclear fission harnesses the energy released when an atom is broken apart, then fusion harnesses the energy released when two smaller atoms are smashed together to create a larger one. It harnesses the same principle as you’ll find inside our sun: Superheated hydrogen atoms fusing to create helium. And while nuclear fusion requires radioactive material, we can source deuterium and tritium from water and lithium. ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) is a giant experimental fusion reactor under construction in France which, when operational, will be the world’s largest. It is backed by a coalition of nations, including the US, EU and China, and has the aim of both generating power and developing the technologies necessary to make Fusion a reality. The organization claims that there is enough of both materials available on the planet to run fusion plants for at least a thousand years, if not longer. There are also a raft of safety benefits, as there’s no creation of the sort of long-lived and dangerous waste associated with nuclear power, no risk of a meltdown, and its raw materials can’t be used to make weapons. But while fusion is entirely possible, and on paper could be the salve to all of the world’s energy ills, it’s not yet a reality. There are a large number of engineering challenges sitting between us and a viable commercial reactor. The shift that has happened this year is that fusion is now being treated as a “strategic national priority,” according to the International Atomic Energy Agency. More than 160 fusion facilities are operational worldwide, each one looking to explore ways of solving the hard problems standing between us and limitless power.But as well as ITER, there are other major nations working to build out their own fusion capacity. The biggest would likely be China’s Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) which has already set a record for energy generation. At the start of this year, it was able to produce a steady state for 1,066 seconds. But what we are seeing now, which may offer some degree of hope, is the surge in interest from the private sector. Companies like Commonwealth Fusion, Type One Energy, Helion and Pacific Fusion are all working on their own fusion facilities. These projects have received billions in funding, but it’s likely all will need time to work out if their approaches are viable. Stuart White is a spokesperson for Tokamak Energy, a British-Japanese startup spun out from the UK’s Atomic Energy Authority which is developing its own fusion technologies. In 2022, the company’s own reactor was able to reach a plasma temperature of 100 million degrees celsius. “It’s an incredible achievement but that isn’t going to power homes around the UK or anywhere,” he said. White believes the fusion world will spend the next decade “scaling up,” projects to find the right pathway to building commercial reactors. He cited national programs, like the UK’s STEP which is targeted to begin working in 2040, while the US’ plan for the mid-2030s he feels is “aggressive.”White also explained that, as equally important as solving the key physics issues, is building out the supply chain to actually make the equipment. He cited the importance of manufacturing in Japan and China to produce the hardware necessary to build fusion reactors. And that this process, while time consuming now, will help accelerate the eventual development of the technology down the line. White added that another positive sign is that regulators aren’t likely to want to scrutinize fusion reactors with the same intensity as they do nuclear reactors. That will both speed up the construction of new facilities and reduce costs when they do eventually enter service. What’s clear, however, is that Fusion is not going to be able to swoop in and decarbonize the world’s energy needs in the sort of time scale it’s likely to be required. (White said it is likely to arrive in time to complement other clean sources of energy over the next half century, rather than so quickly that every other power station gets mothballed instantly.) Consequently, the government of the world must keep prioritizing the rollout of renewables rather than hoping that fusion will simply bail everyone out in the next decade.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/in-2025-ai-and-evs-gave-the-us-an-insatiable-hunger-for-power-133000673.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2F2025-12%2F2be41a47-54bd-4fe3-9337-a20e7a81e13c&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=d8c25488ab1786315c0bb8ddd487660fd24a9a09,https://www.engadget.com/science/in-2025-ai-and-evs-gave-the-us-an-insatiable-hunger-for-power-133000673.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-12T13:30:00Z,19,Tech

The Morning After: Tech’s biggest losers of 2025,"Honestly, compiling the biggest losers for Engadget is more fun than talking up the winners. While we reviewed nothing as atrocious as those ill-fated AI assistant gadgets from 2024, AI companies and services straddled both the winner and loser podiums.
The losers might be you, the American consumer. (Sorry.) In the US, anyone wanting a drone will have to find something that isn’t made by DJI. The company has been targeted by regulators since 2017 over concerns its products could spy on sensitive US infrastructure on behalf of China.
Engadget
The problem is DJI has such a high market share (over 75 percent) that its absence will effectively upend the industry. Oh, and its drones are consistently the best too. The US government hasn’t yet attempted to work with DJI to assess whether its products pose a risk. DJI recently made a final plea for a security review, sending letters to five US agencies that could assess its products. If that fails, US drone options will shrink massively.
In the same 12 months, EV sales across the globe are up around 25 percent this year. Germany set a record in the first half of 2025, with electric cars accounting for nearly one in five new registrations. In China, EV sales are growing so fast (over 50 percent market share) that the country is flooding the global market with gas-powered cars it can’t sell at home. However — remember this is about losers — in the US, the Trump administration ended the EV tax credit. And shock! Sales of EVs in the US slumped, with some automakers, such as Ford, seeing a 60 percent year-over-year decline.
As Sam Rutherford puts it, this policy change puts more roadblocks (his inadvertent pun, not mine) in the way of making cheaper battery-powered cars. It also affects EV investment and could mean US automakers fall even further behind their rivals elsewhere.
We also point and shake our heads at Xbox, Grok and TV streaming. Check it all out right here.

Amazon’s AI-generated recap tool didn’t watch Fallout very closely
It’s already getting the details wrong on its own shows.

Amazon’s plan to offer AI-generated recaps of Prime Video shows isn’t off to a great start. The company’s recap of the first season of Fallout has multiple errors. First, the AI-generated recap incorrectly identifies the era of the show’s Los Angeles-set flashbacks as being the 1950s — they’re actually 2077. Perhaps more egregiously for a recap, it misunderstands the ending of the first season, which sets up season two’s partnership between vault dweller Lucy and The Ghoul.

The best E Ink tablets for 2025,"E Ink tablets have always been intriguing to me because I’m a longtime lover of pen and paper. I’ve had probably hundreds of notebooks over the years, serving as repositories for my story ideas, to-do lists, meeting notes and everything in between. However, I turned away from physical notebooks at a certain point because it was just easier to store everything digitally so I always had my most important information at my fingertips.E Ink tablets seem to provide the best of both worlds: the tactile satisfaction of regular notebooks with many of the conveniences found in digital tools, plus easy-on-the-eyes E Ink screens. These devices have come a long way in the past few years, and we’re just starting to see more color E Ink tablets become more widely available. I tested out a number of different E Ink tablets to see how well they work, how convenient they really are and which are the best tablets using E Ink screens available today.

Best E Ink tablets for 2025 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  
Are E Ink tablets worth it? 
An E Ink tablet will be a worthwhile purchase to a very select group of people. If you prefer the look and feel of an e paper display to LCD panels found on traditional tablets, it makes a lot of sense. They’re also good options for those who want a more paper-like writing experience (although you can get that kind of functionality on a regular tablet with the right screen protector) or a more distraction-free device overall. 
The final note is key here. Many E Ink tablets don’t run on the same operating systems as regular tablets, so you’re automatically going to be limited in what you can do. And even with those that do allow you to download traditional apps like Chrome, Instagram and Facebook, E Ink tablets are not designed to give you the best casual-browsing experience. This is mostly due to the nature of E Ink displays, which have noticeable refreshes, a lack of vibrant colors and lower picture quality than the panels you’ll find on even the cheapest iPad. 
Arguably the biggest reason why you wouldn’t want to go with an iPad (all models of which support stylus input, a plethora of reading apps, etc) is because it’s much easier to get distracted by email, social media and other Internet-related temptations. 
What to look for in an E Ink tablet 
Writing and latency 
Arguably the most important thing to consider when looking for an E Ink tablet is the writing experience. How good it is will depend a lot on the display’s refresh rate (does it refresh after every time you put pen to “paper,” or at a different regular interval) and the stylus’ latency. Most of the tablets I’ve tested have little to no latency, but some are certainly better than others. Finally, you should double check before buying that your preferred E Ink tablet comes with a stylus, or if you need to purchase one separately. 
Reading 
How much will you be reading books, documents and other things on this tablet? E Ink tablets come in many sizes, but most of them tend to be larger than your standard e-reader because it makes writing much easier. Having a larger display isn’t a bad thing, but it might make holding it for long periods slightly more uncomfortable. (Most e-readers are roughly the size of a paperback book, giving you a similar feeling to analog reading). 
The supported file types for e-books can also make a big difference. It’s hard to make a blanket statement here because this varies so much among E Ink tablets. The TL;DR is that you’ll have a much better reading experience if you go with one made by a company that already has a history in e-book sales (i.e. Amazon or Kobo). All of the titles you bought via the Kindle or Kobo store should automatically be available to you on your Kindle or Kobo E Ink tablet. 
Also with Kindle titles, specifically, since they are protected by DRM, it’s not necessarily the best idea to try to bring those titles over to a third-party device. Unless the tablet runs an operating system like Android that supports downloads for apps like Kindle and Kobo, you’ll be limited to supported file types, like ePUB, PDF, MOBI, JPEG, PNG and others. 
Search functionality 
Most E Ink tablets have some on-device search features, but they can vary widely between models. You’ll want to consider how important it is to you to be able to search through all your handwritten notes and markups. I noticed in my testing that Amazon’s and Kobo’s E Ink tablets made it easy to refer back to notes made in books and files because they automatically save to the specific pages on which you took notes, made highlights and more. 
Searching is less standardized on E Ink tablets that have different supported file types, but their features can be quite powerful in their own right. For example, a few devices I tested supported text search in handwritten notes along with handwriting recognition, the latter of which allows you to translate your scribbles into typed text. 
Sharing and connectivity 
While we established that E Ink tablets can be great distraction-free devices, most manufacturers understand that your notes and doodles aren’t created in a vacuum. You may want to access them elsewhere, and that requires some form of connectivity. All of the E Ink tablets I tried have Wi-Fi support, and some support cloud syncing, companion mobile apps and the ability to export notes via email so you can access them elsewhere. 
None of them, however, integrate directly with a digital note taking system like Evernote or OneNote, so these devices will always be somewhat supplementary if you use apps like that, too. I’d argue that, if you already lean heavily on apps like OneNote, a standard tablet with a stylus and screen protector might be the best way to go. Ultimately, you should think about what you will want to do with the documents you’ll interact with on your E Ink tablet after the tablet portion is done. 
Price 
E Ink tablets aren’t known for being cheap. They generally fall into the $300-$800 price range, which is what you can expect to pay for a solid regular tablet, too. A key factor in price is size: cheaper devices with E Ink displays are likely to have smaller screens, and stylus support isn’t as much of a given. Also, those types of devices are generally considered e-readers because of their size and may not be the best for note-taking, doodling and the like. 
E Ink tablets have gone up in price recently. Supernote and Onyx Boox increased prices, as did reMarkable. The former said it was due to &#34;increased costs,” and a reMarkable representative confirmed this to Engadget and provided the following statement: &#34;We regularly review our pricing based on market conditions and operational costs. We&#39;ve communicated an upcoming adjustment for the US market effective in May to provide transparency to our customers. Multiple factors influence our pricing decisions, including supply chain dynamics and overall operational costs in specific markets.” 
As a result, the reMarkable Paper Pro jumped from $579 to $629 (that&#39;s for the bundle with the standard Marker and no Folio). This isn&#39;t great, considering the Paper Pro was already on the expensive side of the spectrum for E Ink tablets. It&#39;s also worth noting that Supernote and Onyx Boox have raised prices in the past few months as well. 
Other E Ink tablets we&#39;ve tested 
Onyx Boox Tab X C 
The Boox Tab X C is a color-screened version of the Tab X, the company’s all-purpose e-paper Android tablet. The Tab X C has a lovely 13.3-inch Kaleido 3 E Ink color display, an octa-core processor, 6GB of RAM and it runs on Android 13, making it one of the most powerful tablets in Boox’s lineup. I’ve used the Tab X in the past and this color version runs similarly, if not better, and at 5.3mm thick, it’s impressively svelte even when you pair it with its folio keyboard case. As someone who loves legal-pad sized things to write on, I also like how the Tab X C is most akin to A4-size paper. But at $820 for the bundle with the standard case (or a whopping $970 for the tablet and its keyboard case), it’s really only best for those who are ready to go all-in on a premium E Ink tablet. 
Lenovo Smart Paper 
Lenovo made a solid E Ink tablet in the Smart Paper, but it&#39;s too pricey and too married to the company&#39;s companion cloud service to warrant a spot on our top picks list. The hardware is great, but the software isn&#39;t as flexible as those of competitors like the reMarkable 2. It has good Google Drive integration, but you must pair it with Lenovo&#39;s cloud service to really get the most use out of it — and in the UK, the service costs £9 per month for three months, which is quite expensive. 
Onyx Boox Tab Ultra 
The Boox Tab Ultra has a lot of the same features we like in the Note Air 2 Plus, but it’s designed to be a true, all-purpose tablet with an E Ink screen. Running Android 11 and compatible with a magnetic keyboard case, you can use it like a standard 2-in-1 laptop, albeit a low-powered one. You can browse the web, check email and even watch YouTube videos on this thing — but that doesn’t mean you should. A standard 2-in-1 laptop with a more responsive screen and better overall performance would be a better fit for most people who even have the slightest desire to have an all-in-one device. Like the rest of Onyx’s devices, the Tab Ultra is specifically for those who put reading and eye comfort above all else.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2024-12%2Fcae33fe0-b8a5-11ef-bb37-67fdb1caf4ca&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=a032a75e6dd550a65a8ebd97e38058e7c1b0f297,https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-12T10:00:36Z,14,Tech

How to simplify enterprise cybersecurity through effective identity management,"
		
					  
						




Identifying and securing ownership of assets can be a challenging task. In addition to multifactor authentication, conditional and privileged access can help organizations to batten down the hatches. But introducing AI technologies often adds a nightmare of complexity.



“It [using AI technologies] has been a huge challenge for organizations because policy management, compliance management and security touch on every single application and every single system,” Naresh Persaud, US cyber digital identity and cyber AI blueprint leader for Deloitte says.



Deloitte’s industrial and financial customers save time with the consultancy’s identity product



Recently, Deloitte worked with a large industrial customer after identifying that account ownership was sometimes unclear in their existing system. When an endpoint event was identified, it was difficult to trace who owned the targeted account and whether it existed under multiple names.



“With identity management systems, we can link the named user of that account and at the same time we can identify whether the account was vaulted in an identity in the privileged access management system,” Persaud explains.



The system also identifies any other accounts associated with a user so they too can be examined for any evidence of intrusion. Persaud refers to this as the blast radius.



“If I compromise a privileged account, I might be able to use that account to reset the password for other accounts,” he says. “Immediately identifying the blast radius, determining an appropriate response and putting that information into the alert — that gives the analyst in the security operation center much better telemetry than they had before.”



The system helped connect pieces of the puzzle that might otherwise have to be done manually. The security analyst who flagged the issue would have needed to contact an identity system administrator — an inefficient process in even the most well-oiled operation. Identifying those points of contact and automating the communication process made for a much more efficient response.



Time is often consumed by attempting to map the data related to an incident to the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework, for example. Industry analysis suggests this can take up to 30 minutes. “With AI enablement an analyst can drastically reduce this time up to 70-80%,” Persaud says.



Persaud claims that the Deloitte solution was able to simplify the documentation. It created a dashboard that identified related accounts that were not vaulted and allowed for closer review of privileged accounts. Unvaulted accounts could be vaulted in short order and any vulnerabilities in privileged accounts could be pinpointed and addressed. This provided a higher level of precision to the way the customer does security now compared to before.



Deloitte also worked with a financial services client that had a similar visibility issue.



“It is challenging for a lot of organizations to get a complete picture of what their assets are and what controls apply to those assets,” Persaud says. He explains that Deloitte’s identity solution assisted the customer in connecting users with the assets they utilized. As they discovered these assets, they were able to fine-tune the security controls that were applied to each in a more refined fashion.



“If the system is going to [process] financial data and other private information, we need to put the right controls in place on the identity side,” he says. “We’ve been able to bring those two pieces together by correlating discovery of assets with discovery of identity and lining that up with controls from the IT asset management system.”



As a result, the users were able to more quickly integrate applications.



How apexanalytix uses Microsoft Azure to manage identity security



“Identity protection is one of the critical controls for any organization in terms of protecting digital assets,” Vishal Grover, CIO of supply chain management platform provider apexanalytix says. “But it is important to maintain the balance between restriction and business requirements.”



Apexanalytics has used Microsoft products, such as Defender, for more than a decade. “Initially, we were primarily using it for antivirus. Then advanced threat protection came into the picture. Then identity protection. We kept adding more controls and more validations to strengthen the entire security posture,” he tells.



The company has been particularly concerned about the increased identity risk as it expands its international footprint — notably opening offices in Hong Kong in 2016 and Saudi Arabia in 2024. As the offices interact and employees travel to other locations, it is crucial that any access to its systems is verified as legitimate.



Their security team has deployed Azure Active Directory (AAD) to verify geographical boundaries — the locations from which employees might reasonably be expected to access their systems from. For example, if an employee based in the US who rarely travels attempts to log in from a remote location where they are unlikely to be, a red flag is immediately raised. Unless the user’s physical presence in that location can be verified, their credentials have likely been compromised.



“From a user perspective, anytime someone is traveling outside of their base location, they need to reach out to the IT and security teams to list their specific location,” Grover notes. The adoption of these policies requires reasonable adjustments to user behavior and company policy. But the rewards are substantial.



“If you think from a broader risk management perspective, this has been fundamental to our security model,” he says. The ability to simply track the locations of employees and assign risk accordingly is a significant advancement in risk monitoring for a company growing its international presence. The company looks out for instances of impossible travel, such as if an employee has entered the system in one location and then in another at a distant location that they could not have possibly reached during a specified period, an alert is raised.



Security analysts also use the software to scan for risky sign-ins. If a user logs in from an IP that has been blacklisted, an alert is raised.



They have increasingly relied on conditional access policies that rely on monitoring user behavior. If a user typically spends an average amount of time on certain applications and then radically changes their behavior the activity is flagged and investigated.



The company continues to evaluate its policies at least quarterly in order to ensure that they accord with its evolving business strategies. Grover feels confident that Azure’s capabilities are up to the task but remains vigilant to new potential vulnerabilities that will need to be addressed.

Housemarque's Saros is delayed to April 30,"
PlayStation had said on X that it would have news about Saros at The Game Awards, and unfortunately, fans excited for the new Housemarque project will need to wait a little longer to get their hands on it. The game has been delayed from its planned March release. But there&#39;s only a short time until the new date of April 30, and pre-orders are open now. Star Rahul Kohli appeared at The Game Awards to introduce the newest trailer for the game. 
I&#39;m glad we won&#39;t be waiting too much longer, because Saros looks very cool. Housemarque made its name on titles like Resogun and Returnal, and Saros seems like a great addition to their library. The latest trailer shows off all the golden and solar vibes in Carcosa. It also has more glimpses of the characters and story as well as the dangerous and deadly beings that will be trying very hard to kill you.

4:LOOP is a co-op shooter from the creator of Left 4 Dead and JJ Abrams' Bad Robot,"The next game from Left 4 Dead designer Mike Booth is putting a sci-fi spin on his last game&#39;s co-op action, based on a trailer Booth and producer JJ Abrams shared at The Game Awards 2025. The new game is called 4:LOOP, and it&#39;s the first project entirely developed by Bad Robot Games, film production company Bad Robot&#39;s game studio.
4:LOOP combines the four-player co-op action of Left 4 Dead, with roguelike elements enabled by what seems like a time loop mechanic. Based on the trailer, players fight a mixture of aliens and robots in each mission, all in the hopes of eventually drawing the attention of an alien mothership and destroying it.

&#34;Each time the four-player team succeeds in a mission, they make choices to improve their equipment, building out a unique kit to survive the epic boss battle at the end of the Act,&#34; Booth said in an interview with PlayStation Blog. &#34;If the team completes all three Acts, they defeat the Mothership and save the world. All of this is, of course, easier said than done.&#34;
Sony Interactive Entertainment announced that it would be publishing 4:LOOP earlier in December, so naturally the game will be available on PS5 and PC when it launches. Players interested in trying 4:LOOP can sign up on the game&#39;s website.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/4loop-is-a-co-op-shooter-from-the-creator-of-left-4-dead-and-jj-abrams-bad-robot-035835461.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2Fd541eea0-d70d-11f0-b5d1-8f8f571350fe&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=cd123d6be1f6b87b29f511f1264b6ea18b964f03,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/4loop-is-a-co-op-shooter-from-the-creator-of-left-4-dead-and-jj-abrams-bad-robot-035835461.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-12T03:58:36Z,7,Tech
Star Wars: Galactic Racer is a podracing game set for 2026,"
Why have one Star Wars game announcement at an edition of The Game Awards when you can have two? Star Wars: Galactic Racer is a podracing (and speeder racing) game from Fuse Games, a studio established in 2023 by former Burnout and Need for Speed developers. It&#39;s scheduled to hit PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC in 2026.
The action here is set after the fall of the Empire. With the galaxy in rebuild mode after dealing with that whole mess, an unsanctioned, underground racing circuit called the Galactic League comes into being in the Outer Rim. Here, according to the game&#39;s Steam page, &#34;syndicates bankroll chaos and champions are forged.&#34; 
Star Wars: Galactic Racer is run-based, so if your podracer blows up, it might be game over. The action takes place across well-known Star Wars planets in addition to some new ones. The races have branching routes and you&#39;ll unlock new abilities on each run.
There&#39;s a story-driven, single-player campaign, as well as PvP modes. The vehicles are customizable too. Dig it. Where do I sign up, Watto?This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/star-wars-galactic-racer-is-a-podracing-game-set-for-2026-035508891.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F0c1031e0-d70d-11f0-9e7f-ff315c72400e&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=0c175cbb700fbd7371619d7ab90f5cb352550a0f,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/star-wars-galactic-racer-is-a-podracing-game-set-for-2026-035508891.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-12T03:55:09Z,7,Tech
Exodus is delayed to early 2027,"
So there&#39;s good news and bad news about the highly anticipated Exodus coming out of The Game Awards this year. The good news is that there&#39;s a fresh trailer showcasing more of the game. The bad news is that the game won&#39;t be out until early 2027. The game was originally announced two years ago (also at The Game Awards) and had been pegged for release in 2026.
We may be waiting longer to get our hands on Exodus, but the substantial new trailer shows more of what the final product will entail, offering some backstory on main character Jun Aslan. He&#39;s the only human who can use the technology developed by Celestials, which are humans that have evolved 40,000 years into the future. The trailer also showcases the character C.C. Orlev, voiced by Matthew McConaughey. (Insert obligatory &#34;alright alright alright&#34; here.) Developer Archetype Entertainment includes some notable names from BioWare, 343 Industries and Naughty Dog, and the BioWare lineage seems particularly strong with this character- and choice-driven science fiction story.

Lara Croft will return in Tomb Raider: Catalyst and a new remake,"The last mainline Tomb Raider game was 2018’s Shadow of the Tomb Raider, and after spending a few years in video game purgatory, Lara Croft is coming back in two new games. At The Game Awards 2025, Amazon Game Studios announced that Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis will reimagine of one of the hero’s early adventures in 2026, and Tomb Raider: Catalyst will continue the series in 2027.Catalyst is developed by Crystal Dynamics and follows Lara through Northern India “in the wake of a mythical cataclysm,” as she comes into competition with other treasure hunters. Legacy of Atlantis, developed by Crystal Dynamics and Flying Wild Hog, reimagines the very first Tomb Raider game in Unreal Engine 5. And yes, it seems like dinosaurs will be in the mix.A new Tomb Raider game has been in the works officially since at least 2022, when Amazon announced that it would be publishing the next game in the series. Amazon shared that Fleabag’s Phoebe Waller-Bridge would be developing a television adaptation of Tomb Raider in May 2024. Sophie Turner, best known for playing Sansa Stark on HBO’s Game of Thrones, was cast as Lara Croft in September 2025. With both a show and a game in the works, Amazon clearly seems interested in making Tomb Raider its next big crossover hit after the success of Fallout.Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis will be released in 2026 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and PC. The platforms Tomb Raider: Catalyst will be released on weren’t shared, but the game is scheduled to be released in 2027.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/lara-croft-will-return-in-tomb-raider-catalyst-and-a-new-remake-025859998.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2FLara-Croft.jpg&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=73b7ef52f45dfdd50aa61146f2e74e598acd48cb,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/lara-croft-will-return-in-tomb-raider-catalyst-and-a-new-remake-025859998.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-12T02:58:59Z,7,Tech

Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight swoops onto PC and consoles on May 29,"
It didn&#39;t take too long for a game that a whole bunch of people are excited about to swoop into Grand Theft Auto VI&#39;s old release week. Or maybe Rockstar had an idea of was what was coming and delayed its blockbuster by six months to get out of the way of Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight. 
Either way, TT Games and Warner Bros. Games brought a new trailer to The Game Awards and revealed that the Caped Crusader&#39;s next adventure will hit PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Steam and the Epic Games Store on May 29. The base game will cost $70 and pre-orders are open as of 11PM ET on December 11.
Lego games often have a massive cast of characters and, as the trailer revealed, this one will be no different. It will feature the likes of Robin, Nightwing, Batgirl and Catwoman, as well as a murderer&#39;s row of super-villains, such as The Joker, Two-Face, Poison Ivy, Mr. Freeze, The Penguin and Bane.
Warner Bros. Games is announcing the release date at a bit of an awkward time. Netflix recently had an $82.7 billion bid accepted for a chunk of Warner Bros. Discovery that includes the gaming division. However, Netflix co-CEO Gregory Peters said the company didn&#39;t factor Warner Bros. Games into its valuation.
&#34;While they definitely have been doing some great work in the game space, we actually didn’t attribute any value to that from the get-go because they’re relatively minor compared to the grand scheme of things,&#34; Peters said, according to PC Gamer. &#34;Now we are super excited because some of those properties that they’ve built, Hogwarts [Legacy] is a great example of that, have been done quite well, and we think that we can incorporate that into what we’re offering. They’ve got great studios and great folks working there. So we think that there’s definitely an opportunity there. But just to be clear, we haven’t built that into our deal model.&#34;This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-swoops-onto-pc-and-consoles-on-may-29-024729940.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2Fe89bd030-d701-11f0-becd-a9fdffe78077&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=d201bf49cf8a82f2dff54ed8d615d25fc0837aeb,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-swoops-onto-pc-and-consoles-on-may-29-024729940.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-12T02:47:29Z,7,Tech

South of Midnight is coming to PS5 and Switch 2 next spring,"South of Midnight is heading to PlayStation 5 and Switch 2 in Spring 2026, developer Compulsion Games announced on X. The third-person action-adventure game launched as an Xbox and PC exclusive, but like plenty of Microsoft&#39;s other first-party games, it&#39;s heading to competitors&#39; consoles.Mixing platforming with magic-infused combat in a unique setting inspired by the folklore of the South, Compulsion Games&#39; South of Midnight  was generally well-received when it was released in April 2025. The game likely reached sizable audience by launching on Game Pass and PC, but coming to PlayStation and Switch will open it up to an even bigger audience.As Microsoft reworks its Xbox brand to focus more on software than hardware, releasing its exclusives on other platforms has become a key part of its ongoing strategy. It tested the water with games like Pentiment, Hi-Fi Rush and Sea of Thieves in 2024, and now everything from Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and Halo are making the jump.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/south-of-midnight-is-coming-to-ps5-and-switch-2-next-spring-022725892.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2FScreenshot_2025-12-11_at_6.21.38%25E2%2580%25AFPM.png&resize=1400%2C779&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=7b41be7035314cabfb131e0736f9dcbe5a0ab138,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/south-of-midnight-is-coming-to-ps5-and-switch-2-next-spring-022725892.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-12T02:27:25Z,4,Tech
Trump orders creation of litigation task force to challenge state AI laws,"On Thursday evening, President Donald Trump signed an executive order calling for a single, nationwide regulatory framework governing artificial intelligence at the expense of the ability of different states to regulate the nascent technology. “To win, United States AI companies must be free to innovate without cumbersome regulation,” the order states. “But excessive State regulation thwarts this imperative.” As was expected after a draft of the order leaked earlier this week, the centerpiece of the document is an “AI Litigation Task Force whose sole responsibility shall be to challenge state AI laws inconsistent” with the president’s policy vision. US Attorney General Pam Bondi has 30 days  to create the task force, which shall meet regularly with the White House’s AI and crypto czar, David Sacks.  As laid out in the president’s AI Action Plan from July, the administration will also limit states with “onerous” AI laws from accessing federal funding. Specifically, the secretary of commerce will target funding available under the Broadband Equity Access and Deployment (BEAD) Program, a $42.5 billion effort to expand high-speed internet access in rural communities. Advocacy groups were quick to criticize the president’s order. “This executive order is designed to chill state-level action to provide oversight and accountability for the developers and deployers of AI systems, while doing nothing to address the real and documented harms these systems create,” Alexandra Givens, president and CEO of the Center for Democracy and Technology, said in a statement provided to Engadget. “States that take steps to protect their residents from such harms should not be subject to threats of legal attacks; nor should the administration punish rural Americans by threatening to withhold funding for the broadband services that could connect them to AI in the first place.”It’s worth noting President Trump’s previous attempts to curb the ability of states to regulate AI as they see fit has proven unpopular across the political spectrum. As part of his One Big Beautiful Bill, the president attempted to impose a 10-year moratorium on state-level AI regulation. That clause was eventually removed from the legislation in a decisive 99-1 vote by the Senate.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/trump-orders-creation-of-litigation-task-force-to-challenge-state-ai-laws-022657022.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2F2025-12%2F688e7aaf-f8b9-4786-a6c8-4178fb6195a8&resize=1400%2C965&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=4f050324f36264389d843a10f8aed1bde1f213b5,https://www.engadget.com/ai/trump-orders-creation-of-litigation-task-force-to-challenge-state-ai-laws-022657022.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-12T02:26:57Z,15,Tech
The devs of SOMA are back with a spiritual successor called Ontos,"Frictional Games is back with a new game that looks primed to carry on the studio&#39;s tradition of excellence in horror. It&#39;s called Ontos, and it&#39;s slated to launch on PC, PlayStation and Xbox next year. The trailer debuted during The Game Awards 2025.The company&#39;s past projects include Amnesia: The Dark Descent and SOMA, and this new title is also looking pretty dang creepy. It looks like things will take a philosophical turn, with a story of trying to piece together your father&#39;s past that leads you to questioning the meaning of life and reality. The team is going big with the casting, with Stellan Skarsgård playing one of the main roles in the trailer. This is one that any horror fans will want to keep on their radar.

Control Resonant steps into a larger world that's inspired by Neon Genesis Evangelion,"Remedy Entertainment&#39;s Control is a bizarre yet totally captivating action game that feels like Die Hard by way of David Lynch. InControl: Resonant, players step into the role of the original game&#39;s most enigmatic and unsettling characters for their own jaunt through a &#39;new-weird&#39; world outside The Oldest House.Just ahead of the reveal at The Game Awards, we got an early look at Control: Resonant, the next game in the Remedy Connected Universe. Along with learning why the developers wanted a new protagonist, they also explain why this Neon Genesis Evangelion-inspired sequel is the most expansive game they have made to date.Seven years after the events of Control, the hostile supernatural force that plagued The Oldest House has invaded Manhattan. As the massive urban landscape morphs into an otherworldly nightmare and the Federal Bureau of Control director, Jesse Faden, goes missing, the remaining FBC sends her brother, the notorious supernatural entity Dylan Faden, into the city to stop the invasion. To find his sister and stop the devastation from spreading beyond New York City, Dylan will have to embrace his powers, and some occasional guidance from The Board, to take on the malevolent forces looking to reshape the world.In the years since Control&#39;s release, developer Remedy has expanded the story into a larger, connected universe spanning multiple games, including the Alan Wake series and the co-op spin-off FBC: Firebreak. Control: Resonant picks up on many threads left by recent games including Alan Wake 2, which saw the FBC investigate the supernatural events following the titular character. However, the sequel is going with a bit of a different direction, this time embracing melee-driven combat and a more &#34;open-ended&#34; approach to exploration within the Inception-style landscape of Manhattan. Though the developers were clear that it is not an open-world game, they stated during the presentation that it is embracing a more action-RPG approach and that it&#39;s also the most expansive game they have ever made.It&#39;s an interesting premise for a sequel, especially considering the focus on the original game&#39;s most unnerving characters. But according to creative director Mikael Kasurinen, the concept ties into showing parallels between the Faden siblings and how they navigate this new-weird world.&#34;Each game represents one of the siblings and their respective journeys through this world. Because of this, you can play these games in any order; they stand on their own feet like two independent siblings,&#34; Kasurinen said. &#34;When Dylan wakes up, he&#39;s the only one who can fight back against the Hiss and try to contain the disaster. He has lived his whole life inside The Oldest House, so the door leading outside to Manhattan might as well be a portal to an alien world. To him, this leads to a discovery of a new reality, just like what The Oldest House was to Jesse.&#34;Much like the original game, Control: Resonant maintains that balance of exploration, discovery, and over-the-top action beats to overcome. The sequel leans a bit further into the latter, with Dylan adopting a more aggressive, brawler combat style with his shapeshifting melee weapon. We got to see Dylan switch between short-bladed weapons and a massive hammer, which opened some cool looking combo attacks. It&#39;s very much in the vein of Jesse&#39;s Service Weapon, but now designed for getting up close to deal heavy melee damage.Control Resonant screenshotRemedy EntertainmentFrom what we saw in the footage, the core combat feels equal parts Nier: Automata and DmC: Devil May Cry, showing Dylan dodging attacks and slipping through blind spots to unleash ground and aerial combo strikes. It&#39;s a notable shift away from the third-person shooting gameplay from the original, but it still captures the same weird, otherworldly feel. According to the creative director, the core inspiration for making a sequel with a new character was to contrast storytelling perspectives and gameplay styles — as he puts it, both characters represent two sides of the same coin.&#34;When we looked at the siblings [as characters], it was almost like turning to the other side of a coin – Jesse uses a gun, but Dylan chooses a melee weapon. When we created the large environments, compared to the original, it was a challenge to incorporate shooting combat, as we didn&#39;t want people to have to keep finding cover to avoid fire. But with melee weapons, the combat instantly became more aggressive and intimate, where you&#39;re really going for the enemies. It really changed the dynamic of the Control combat experience. So it felt right, and it&#39;s also refreshing for us to create something a bit new for us.&#34;So far, Control: Resonant looks like a sequel that ups the weirdness of the series and takes it into the twisting, inverted streets of Manhattan. It&#39;s a stunning-looking game, and one particular source of inspiration for the creative direction was the seminal 1990s anime series Neon Genesis Evangelion. Having seen the game&#39;s corrupted world and enigmatic protagonist in motion, that totally tracks. I can&#39;t wait to see what other oddities are to come in Remedy&#39;s new-weird sequel.Control: Resonant will arrive in 2026 for PC/Mac, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.Control Resonant screenshotRemedy EntertainmentThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/control-resonant-steps-into-a-larger-world-thats-inspired-by-neon-genesis-evangelion-021310781.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2Fcontrolresonant2_8173.jpg&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=29699f162e3d8ad94d7db9b9944887cb8d6da976,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/control-resonant-steps-into-a-larger-world-thats-inspired-by-neon-genesis-evangelion-021310781.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-12T02:13:10Z,7,Tech

Larian Studios is returning to the Divinity series with... Divinity,"Larian Studios didn’t rest on its laurels for long. Two years after taking home the Game of the Year prize for Baldur’s Gate III at The Game Awards, the developer popped up again at the 2025 edition of the ceremony to announce its upcoming project, which is the next entry in the Divinity series. Simply called Divinity, this will be the studio’s biggest game to date with “more breadth and depth than ever before,” according to TGA host Geoff Keighley.After 2017’s Divinity: Original Sin II, Larian took a break from the series with which it established itself to make BG3.  The rumor mill had been churning about a new Divinity game after Keighley shared a photo of a statue that was erected in the Mojave Desert. The shape of the statue matched a Divinity logo that was trademarked recently.Before the reveal trailer was shown at The Game Awards, a short (and rather neat) live performance took place in which some actors were hoisted into the air. The trailer itself is pretty gruesome. It references The Wicker Man, as large wooden effigies with people chained inside are set ablaze. I won’t spoil what else happens other than to say it’s pretty gruesome, so maybe don’t watch it quite yet if you’ve just had dinner.Larian hasn’t announced a release window for Divinity yet.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/larian-studios-is-returning-to-the-divinity-series-with-divinity-015833088.html?src=rss",,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/larian-studios-is-returning-to-the-divinity-series-with-divinity-015833088.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-12T01:58:33Z,7,Tech
"Ten years after The Witness, Jonathan Blow's next massive puzzle game is almost ready for primetime","Many of the big announcements at The Game Awards are for completely new projects, some of which are total surprises (if you had an Okami sequel on your bingo card last year, you&#39;re either in the know or probably used up all your luck for the next few years). We&#39;ll often get updates on games that were previously announced too. The trailer for Order of the Sinking Star is something a little different, as it&#39;s a game that Braid  designer Jonathan Blow has been working on fairly openly since releasing The Witness in 2016. The trailer revealed some new details, including confirmation of the expected title and a release window (2026 on Steam, with more platforms to be announced). Ahead of The Game Awards, Blow gave Engadget a preview of the game and explained some of its many complexities.Fundamentally, Order of the Sinking Star is a grid-based puzzle game in which you&#39;ll move blocks around to complete an objective. You might know of this as a Sokoban game, named after the series Hiroyuki Imabayashi created about pushing boxes around a warehouse.But this is a Jonathan Blow game, so nothing stays too simple for very long. Blow and his team took the core concept of pushing objects around and built on it in myriad ways, with a wide array of environments, mechanics and characters for you to get to grips with. Order of the Sinking Star starts with you playing as a deposed queen from another world who is transported to a strange place. This turns out to be the tutorial. Among other things, you&#39;ll find out about the undo button, a handy option you can use to revert your actions if you get stuck. It&#39;s probably worth being careful with this button, as Blow says it&#39;s possible to undo thousands of moves with it. There&#39;s a level reset option too.The first phase of the game has four distinct territories with their own characters, stories and gameplay mechanics. One of these realms has a fantasy theme with a warrior character who can push multiple objects that are in a row. His friend, the thief, can only pull objects. The wizard, meanwhile, can teleport and swap positions with objects or other characters. Sometimes, you&#39;ll use multiple characters in a level and swap between them to solve puzzles. There’s a talking boat somewhere, too.You&#39;ll take what you learn within individual levels into the overworld so you can make progress there. For one thing, the queen can wear a warrior, wizard or thief outfit to adopt their abilities and solve puzzles in the north section of this phase. Over in the east, there’s a world with mirror-based puzzles. By positioning the mirrors and where you stand, you&#39;ll use the mirror&#39;s reflection to teleport at a right angle. If your character (or an object) has a reflection in two mirrors, they can be duplicated, which is something you might have to do a few times if a level requires you activate multiple switches at the same time.Once you near the end of two of the phase one worlds, you can enter one of six gold rooms. In these rooms, which are the gateways to the second phase of Order of the Sinking Star, some of your characters meet each other for the first time. For instance, the guy from The Mirror Isles and the wizard might encounter each other in a gold room and then you can use their combined abilities to solve puzzles. Given that later-game levels combine mechanics from the early stages, they are naturally more complex. Shifting to 3D perspectives will ramp things up too.Order of the Sinking StarThekla/Arc GamesYou can tackle the four worlds that make up the first phase in any order. Collectively, they contain &#34;days worth of gameplay,&#34; Blow said. And yet he claimed this first phase accounts for about five percent of the entire game. All told, there are about 1,400 puzzles, many of which are optional. If you&#39;re a completionist, you&#39;ll need to be pretty dedicated to see this through. Blow estimates that it&#39;ll take around 500 hours for a player to do absolutely everything in the game. The overworld has more than 100 screens from which you can jump into individual levels. &#34;All the levels are about ideas. They&#39;re not just random puzzles,&#34; Blow said. &#34;We don&#39;t add puzzles to the game unless they show something cool about how the objects interact. Then, once you see the cool thing, you come back to the overworld, and you navigate from that screen using the cool mechanic that you learned.&#34;&#34;We&#34; is a key word there, because it&#39;s not as if Blow has been making Order of the Sinking Star by himself for the last decade. His studio, Thekla, has around 10 people working on the game full-time along with another 10 or so part-time contractors. Those who contributed include puzzle game designers Alan Hazelden and Marc ten Bosch. Some members of Blow&#39;s Twitch community who &#34;contributed some idea to one of the levels somewhere&#34; will receive design credits too.Blow and his team use custom game engines for their projects. Starting in around 2013, he started livestreaming his work on the programming language that Order of the Sinking Star is written in (Thekla will eventually make the engine available for free as an open-source project). &#34;Once I was working on the game, it was a good way to show people what the programming language was about and also how game programming works, and so I would frequently do just streams where we would sit down and implement something,&#34; Blow said. Some of the design work he did on stream ended up in the final game.Order of the Sinking StarThekla/Arc GamesAfter such a long time of working on Order of the Sinking Star, the end is in sight for Blow and his team. The main focus for the last year or so has been on making sure all of the puzzles align with the overworld. Making art for many hundreds of levels is a major undertaking too, while Blow is still refining the story. &#34;Because there&#39;s a lot of these levels and a lot of characters in the levels, it&#39;s just natural for them to talk to each other,&#34; Blow said. &#34;And so what is that dialog and what does it do? Is it just little jokes that don&#39;t add up to anything? Or do you get little peeks into a larger narrative? I think the latter is obviously better. And so that&#39;s my main task between now and release, is making sure that the story is really good.&#34;Blow had the core concept of having separate worlds with mechanics that work across them in place from the very beginning, though how that worked in practice evolved a lot over time. For instance, the overworld idea wasn&#39;t set in stone from the outset. There was an overworld in place by around 2021, &#34;but it wasn&#39;t organized in the way the current one was. It was just sort of areas smushed together,&#34; Blow said. &#34;At some point, I came up with this concept that it was spatially organized in an almost ritualistic manner or a mathematical manner, whichever way you want to think about it. And we redesigned the overworld from that point, and from then till now, it&#39;s been just sort of a continuous improvement.&#34;Order of the Sinking Star was originally supposed to be a much smaller game that took around 10 or 20 hours to play, but &#34;it just blew up,&#34; Blow said. &#34;Part of development has just been dealing with that fact. Like, oh, my God, this game took so long to make. It actually feels really good to be here toward the end. We still have a fair bit of work to do before it&#39;s done, but we can see the ending from where we are now, and that&#39;s great.&#34;This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ten-years-after-the-witness-jonathan-blows-next-massive-puzzle-game-is-almost-ready-for-primetime-015727378.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2Foss_lead.jpg&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=b82d48c20b6d4e26a574ed8040bbb0ae4e7c75d0,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ten-years-after-the-witness-jonathan-blows-next-massive-puzzle-game-is-almost-ready-for-primetime-015727378.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-12T01:57:27Z,9,Tech

Coven of the Chicken Foot is the debut game from Naughty Dog alum Bruce Straley's indie studio,"Coven of the Chicken Foot has a lot of things going for it already, in my book. It stars a hero rarely seen in video games, an elderly woman, and it has gorgeous storybook-style art in a lush fantasy setting. It’s a single-player puzzle platformer, it relies on wordless storytelling and the woman, a witch named Gertie, travels with a creepy-cute companion. Plus, Gertie has chicken feet. I love her little chicken feet.Coven of the Chicken Foot is the first game from Wildflower Interactive, the independent studio founded by Naughty Dog veteran Bruce Straley. The game is coming to Steam and it’s available to wishlist now, though there’s no firm release date. The first trailer for Coven of the Chicken Foot premiered at The Game Awards 2025, showing Gertie and her friend traveling together through caves, forests and temples. Gertie is on a quest to prove herself to the local coven by standing up to the self-appointed, prideful heroes of the land. She doesn’t have a sword or a dodgeroll, and instead has to figure out how to work with her strange friend to survive. Her companion develops unique behaviors based on individual play styles, shaping how Gertie gets around.Straley left Naughty Dog in 2017 after almost 20 years with the studio, where he directed The Last of Us and Uncharted 4. He announced Wildflower Interactive in July 2022 with a brief YouTube message, saying, “In 2017 I left the industry not sure if I wanted to make games anymore. But the longer I was away, I kept thinking about this medium, and everything yet to be done and everything I wanted to do still. And this idea kept following me. So I grabbed some friends and we started prototyping.”This naturally led to the formation of a studio, Straley explained. “We have to do it the right way,” he said in the video. “It has to be inclusive, equitable and collaborative, full of big-hearted people that want to grow both professionally and personally. The culture needs to be as iterative as the way we make games.”Coven of the Chicken FootWildflower InteractiveToday Wildflower Interactive has 16 employees from AAA and smaller-scale backgrounds, according to its website. Its mission statement reads as follows:“We’re making ‘small-ish,’ creatively-charged, uniquely-stylized games that explore the possibilities of our medium. And we’re building a small, open-hearted team of creators that want to improve their skills and still lead a good life outside of work. People that want to hone their craft, have a say in the process, feel respected for their contributions, and be a part of the evolution of this awesome medium.”I’m not going to say the studio’s direct and repeated emphasis on work-life balance, diversity and compassion is a response to the soulless capitalistic grind built into the AAA development complex, but I’m not going to not say that, either.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/coven-of-the-chicken-foot-is-the-debut-game-from-naughty-dog-alum-bruce-straleys-indie-studio-014004553.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2FCotCF_Screenshot_6_nologo.jpg&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=0755b7e262297efecfbfaa794e67f5139b2d2b55,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/coven-of-the-chicken-foot-is-the-debut-game-from-naughty-dog-alum-bruce-straleys-indie-studio-014004553.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-12T01:40:04Z,7,Tech
Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic is a new action RPG from the director of Mass Effect and KOTOR,"The Game Awards kicked off with a bang, showing the world premiere of Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic. It&#39;s a brand new action role-playing game that will be directed by Casey Hudson, who previously headed up several notable BioWare games you probably know like Mass Effect and Star Wars: Knight of the Old Republic.There’s not much to go on in the trailer, but the game simply existing is a pretty great surprise and this cinematic trailer sure looks shiny. Hudson is working with Arcanaut Studios on this project, which is described as “an epic interactive adventure across a galaxy on the brink of rebirth where every decision shapes your path towards light or darkness.” Which kind of sounds like Star Wars crossed with Mass Effect, and I am personally very excited for that combo.

Capcom's Pragmata is coming your way on April 24,"Capcom’s long, long-delayed sci-fi shooter Pragmata finally has a release date. It’s headed your way on April 24, 2026 on Steam, PS5, Xbox Series X/S and — as Capcom confirmed in a trailer at The Game Awards — Nintendo Switch 2. You don’t have to wait another four months to try it out, though. A gameplay demo is out now on Steam. It will be available for consoles at a later date.Pragmata first emerged all the way back in 2020 and Capcom initially planned to release it in 2022. After multiple delays, the game will arrive four years later than the company anticipated. This is the first entry in a new franchise from Capcom, so taking extra time to get things right is not exactly a bad idea. Pragmata, which is set in a dystopian near-future, features the dual protagonists of Hugh Williams (a heavily armored fella) and Diana (an android with special powers). The two have to work together if they want to escape from a lunar research station that’s filled with malevolent robots. To defeat these clankers, Diana has to hack them to disable their defense systems and make a weak point available for Hugh to attack.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/capcoms-pragmata-is-coming-your-way-on-april-24-010826258.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2Fpragmata.jpg&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=3f50385b301adc805cc957be0ef5e94b4e7026dd,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/capcoms-pragmata-is-coming-your-way-on-april-24-010826258.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-12T01:08:26Z,7,Tech
OpenAI expands ‘defense in depth’ security to stop hackers using its AI models to launch cyberattacks,"
		
					  
						




OpenAI is preparing for the possibility that threat groups will try to abuse its increasingly powerful AI frontier models to carry out sophisticated cyberattacks.



In a blog, the company describes how the evolving capabilities of its models could be used to “develop working zero-day remote exploits against well-defended systems, or meaningfully assist with complex, stealthy enterprise or industrial intrusion operations aimed at real-world effects.”



According to OpenAI, the underlying problem is that offensive and defensive uses of AI rely on the same knowledge and techniques. This makes it challenging to enable one without making possible the other. 



“We are investing in safeguards to help ensure these powerful capabilities primarily benefit defensive uses and limit uplift for malicious purposes,” the company said, adding, “we see this work not as a one-time effort, but as a sustained, long-term investment in giving defenders an advantage and continually strengthening the security posture of the critical infrastructure across the broader ecosystem.”



One new initiative is the Frontier Risk Council. The company offered few details of how this will operate, but said it was part of an expanding “defense in depth” strategy designed to contain the widely-speculated potential of AI as an adversarial tool.



“Members will advise on the boundary between useful, responsible capability and potential misuse, and these learnings will directly inform our evaluations and safeguards. We will share more on the council soon” OpenAI said.  



Other initiatives mentioned in the blog include expanding guardrails against misuse, external Red Team testing to assess model security, and a trusted access program designed to give qualifying customers access to enhanced models to explore defensive use cases.



OpenAI also plans to expand its use of its recently announced Aardvark Agentic Security Researcher scanning tool beta to identify vulnerabilities in its codebase and suggest patches or mitigations.



Red Teaming AI



AI companies find themselves under increasing pressure to explain how they will block model misuse. The anxiety is not hypothetical; last month, OpenAI rival Anthropic admitted that its AI programming tool, Claude Code, had been used as part of a cyberattack targeting 30 organizations, the first time malicious AI exploitation has been discovered on this scale.



Meanwhile, university researchers in the US reported this week that the Artemis AI research platform outperformed nine out of ten penetration testers at finding security vulnerabilities. As the team pointed out, it did this at a fraction of the cost of a human researcher, potentially expanding access to such capabilities beyond well-resourced criminals.



Balancing this is the possibility that defenders could use AI to find the same vulnerabilities. OpenAI’s blog alludes to this capability when it mentions testing its models against the Red Teaming Network it announced two years ago.



The reaction of industry experts to OpenAI’s latest announcement has been mixed. A recurring worry is the inherent difficulty of stopping malicious use of leading models.



“OpenAI is asking models to constrain their own capabilities through refusal training, which can be compared to asking a lock to decide when it should open,” commented Jesse Williams, co-founder and COO of AI agent DevOps company, Jozu. In effect, the model, not its human authors, defines what is harmful.



“The distinction is intent and authorization, which models cannot infer from prompts. Jailbreaks consistently defeat refusal training, and sophisticated adversaries will probe detection boundaries and route around them. Safeguards reduce casual misuse, but won’t stop determined threats,” said Williams.



“OpenAI’s ‘trusted access program’ sounds reasonable until you examine implementation. Who qualifies as trusted? University researchers? Defense contractors? Foreign SOC analysts?”



According to Rob Lee, chief AI officer at the SANS Institute, the problem of AI misuse can’t be solved by one company on its own – not even the mighty OpenAI. “Companies are pushing models that can autonomously discover or weaponize vulnerabilities, but the global safety ecosystem — governments, frontier labs, researchers, and standards bodies — is fragmented and uncoordinated,” said Lee.



“The result is a widening gap where speed becomes its own vulnerability, creating conditions for cascading failures across infrastructure, finance, healthcare, and critical systems.”



Not all experts are this pessimistic. According to Allan Liska, threat intelligence analyst at Recorded Future, it is important not to exaggerate the threat posed by AI. “While we have reported an uptick in interest and capabilities of both nation-state and cybercriminal threat actors when it comes to AI usage, these threats do not exceed the ability of organizations following best security practices,” said Liska.



“That may change in the future, however, at this moment it is more important than ever to understand the difference between hype and reality when it comes to AI and other threats.”

Bradley the Badger looks like Wreck-It Ralph as a real video game,"A lot of trailers drop during The Game Awards, but the comedy of Bradley the Badger stood out from the pack. The conceit is similar to Wreck-It Ralph. Bradley, the protagonist of a fictional platforming series, is suddenly transported into the worlds of other unfinished video games; the trailer shows a badger-ified Bloodborne, Cyberpunk 2077 and The Last of Us. He also has access to a kit of dev tools that let him modify these incomplete projects, getting a taste of making a game. As the trailer ends, Bradley briefly crosses into the real world and comes face to face with an actual game developer. This looks like it will be a funny and very meta game. Astro Bot made that combo work brilliantly, so here&#39;s hoping Bradley the Badger does too. &#34;Bradley is part love letter to videogames and part satire of them,&#34; said Christian Cantamessa, co-founder of Day 4 Night Studios. &#34;Games are an art form and this is a story inspired by our adventures making them.&#34; Cantamessa and fellow co-founder Davide Soliani have some big credits on their resumes, including Red Dead Redemption, Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor and Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle. The titular badger is voiced by Evan Peters, who has been in the recent X-Men movies as well as Tron: Ares.The team is planning to release the game on Steam, with consoles possibly to follow, but no timeline has been given yet.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/bradley-the-badger-looks-like-wreck-it-ralph-as-a-real-video-game-005634520.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2FBradley_The_Badger_Screenshot_05.png&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=03b92d4fa07b6efe64caa927a344127ed546c15d,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/bradley-the-badger-looks-like-wreck-it-ralph-as-a-real-video-game-005634520.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-12T00:56:34Z,7,Tech

"Meet ConsentFix, a new twist on the ClickFix phishing attack","
		
					  
						




A new variation of the ClickFix scam tries to get around phishing defenses by capturing an employee’s OAuth authentication token for Microsoft logins.



Researchers at Push Security this week outlined the tactic, which they call ConsentFix, in a blog, calling it “a dangerous evolution of ClickFix and consent phishing that is incredibly hard for traditional security tools to detect and block.”



Generally ClickFix attacks display a fake error or counterfeit CAPTCHA verification to a user to get them to copy, paste and execute malicious commands on their devices.



What’s new in a ConsentFix attack is that the attack happens entirely inside a browser, say the researchers, which removes one of the key detection opportunities because the attack doesn’t touch an endpoint.



The attack starts with a victim coming across a legitimate but compromised website they are looking for in a Google search, which completely circumvents email-based anti-phishing controls. Going to the site triggers a fake Cloudflare CAPTCHA-like verification page asking the victim to enter their business email address to prove they’re human. Doing so makes a Microsoft login page pop up which includes a legitimate URL, based on the victim’s email address, that would contain an OAuth token. The victim is asked to copy and paste that URL into a field, again, to verify they are human. The URL is captured by the threat actor, at which point the victim has granted the attacker access to their Microsoft account via Azure’s command line interface, say the researchers.



“At this point, the attacker has effective control of the victim’s Microsoft account, but without ever needing to phish a password, or pass an MFA (multifactor authentication) check,” says Push Security. “In fact, if the user was already logged in to their Microsoft account (i.e. they had an active session) no login is required at all.”



Christopher Kayser, social engineering expert and president of Canadian-based firm Cybercrime Analytics, says the attack plays on two tactics favored by threat actors: obedience (cut and paste this URL) and trust (this looks like a Microsoft login page). “People think because they are on a trusted [Microsoft] platform that this is OK,” he said in an interview.



But this attack also shows the failures of security awareness training that many organizations perform. If training is effective, employees should suspect there’s something wrong when an app asks for a business email address to confirm they are human, he said, and know that it’s suspicious when they’re asked to cut and paste anything online as a way of proving they are human.



“This is an incredibly new, innovative attack method,” commented Roger Grimes, data-driven defense CISO advisor at KnowBe4. “It’s almost unfair to classify it as a Clickfix subvariant, even though it is.” However, the odds an employee will copy a long URL string as a test of their humanity has to be very, very low, he added. “It screams different and scammy even to the most unknowledgeable user. Can you see your grandparents doing this? Not me. But I’m sure some people do do it, or else the scammers would not try it,” he said.



“My guess is that its rate of success is so, so low that it doesn’t become a popular scam method that most of us need to worry about,” he said. “What we do need to communicate to users is how often Cloudflare’s brand is being used in social engineering scams, and what the correct Cloudflare authentication/validation looks like. The Cloudflare CAPTCHA check has become the fake antivirus screen of today’s world.”



Organizations must recognize that the ConsentFix attack highlights the dangers of implicit trust in first-party applications, and in the continued use of legacy OAuth scopes, said Avivah Litan, lead analyst for AI trust, risk and security management at Gartner. These include older permission sets within Microsoft Entra ID that grant broad access and are not subject to modern security controls or monitoring. 



“Attackers exploit these legacy scopes to enumerate directory data, meaning they can systematically retrieve and map out user accounts, groups, and other directory objects within the organization,” she said. “This reconnaissance enables attackers to identify high-value targets and plan further attacks, all without triggering alerts that would be associated with newer, more tightly controlled permissions.”



 The most effective mitigation strategy to this kind of attack is a combination of robust monitoring, strengthened consent governance and real-time user protection, Litan noted. “By addressing these foundational issues — specifically, by limiting the use of legacy OAuth scopes, tightening consent processes for all applications, and deploying browser-based security — enterprises can substantially reduce the risk of unauthorized access resulting from OAuth consent abuse and enhance their overall identity security posture.”



Push Security notes that the attack could be successful because targeting a first-party app like Azure CLI means that many of the mitigating controls available for third-party app integrations don’t apply. Because there’s no login required, phishing-resistant authentication controls like passkeys have no impact on this attack, the researchers add. And the use of advanced detection evasion techniques makes this attack difficult to investigate, meaning these attacks are going undetected.



One of the problems is that most security awareness training isn’t doing enough to lower the odds of employees falling for phishing scams, said Kayser.



He cited a study of phishing messages sent to employees at a California hospital over a period of eight months. Those who had taken a cybersecurity awareness course were just as likely to have fallen for a phishing message as those who didn’t, he said.



Training often fails because instructors talk too much in technical terms, he said. Instead they should explain attacks, how they work and how to recognize them.



“If you can explain to people what’s going on, that sticks,” he maintained.

Apple (mostly) loses its appeal in Epic Games case,"Apple has clawed back a bit of ground in its legal fight with Epic Games that could have wide-reaching consequences for all app developers. Today, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals mostly upheld a previous contempt ruling regarding fees Apple levied on third-party payment systems. However, the judges did decide to reverse the order that Apple cannot charge any commissions on those external payments, which was one of the company&#39;s main arguments in this ongoing debate.   To catch you up, US Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers initially ruled in 2021 that Apple must allow third-party payment systems, although her decision fell shy of calling the tech company&#39;s control over the App Store a monopoly. In May 2025, she ruled that Apple&#39;s 27 percent commission on those outside payments violated her previous order. Apple responded with an emergency motion to appeal that finding. Epic Games had taken its smash hit Fortnite off both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store while it was in court arguing these cases. Fortnite returned to iOS in the spring and just arrived back on Android devices today.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-mostly-loses-its-appeal-in-epic-games-case-235509557.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2F2025-12%2F2cffee29-4cec-4ffb-95d3-2ec81390ae80&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=e1f6fb2c7a1c16b2cfd610957b869b6907464e31,https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-mostly-loses-its-appeal-in-epic-games-case-235509557.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-11T23:55:09Z,7,Tech

Amazon's AI-generated recap tool didn't watch Fallout very closely,"Amazon&#39;s plan to offer AI-generated recaps of Prime Video shows isn&#39;t off to a great start. The company&#39;s recap of the first season of Fallout features multiple errors, GamesRadar+ writes, including basic facts about the plot of the show.You can watch the recap yourself in the &#34;Extras&#34; section of Amazon&#39;s Fallout season two listing in Prime Video. Besides being somewhat dry, the AI-generated recap incorrectly identifies the time period of the show&#39;s Los Angeles-set flashbacks as being the 1950s, when they&#39;re actually 2077 (the Fallout franchise is set in an alternate history that diverged from our real one after 1945). As Gizmodo notes, the recap also seems to misunderstand the ending of the first season, which sets up season two&#39;s partnership between vault dweller Lucy and The Ghoul, an irradiated wastelander with a personal connection to the mystery at the heart of the first season.While the recap suggests Amazon&#39;s AI system can successfully combine clips, music and dialogue into a coherent video, it apparently lacks an understanding of the details. The inaccuracies in this recap won&#39;t prevent anyone from enjoying the second season of the show, but they don&#39;t exactly inspire confidence in Amazon&#39;s tool either. It also seems like a problem that could have been easily solved by having a human employee who&#39;s watched the show review the video before it was uploaded.Unfortunately, Amazon&#39;s lack of AI quality control extends beyond recaps of its shows and into the dubs for the shows themselves. The company pulled AI-generated voiceover tracks for Banana Fish and other anime because of how bad they sounded earlier this week. It wouldn&#39;t be surprising if this recap gets pulled, corrected and re-uploaded, too. As Amazon adds more AI-generated content to its platform, users are bound to discover more ways it comes up short. The company&#39;s audience is too big, and AI is apparently still too unreliable for it to be avoided.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/amazons-ai-generated-recap-tool-didnt-watch-fallout-very-closely-215712958.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2FFallout-Season-Two.jpg&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=cfb5936118f7a33e52fcbf0e335e2c5c52772056,https://www.engadget.com/ai/amazons-ai-generated-recap-tool-didnt-watch-fallout-very-closely-215712958.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-11T21:57:12Z,8,Tech

Disney's deal with OpenAI is about controlling the future of copyright,"This morning Disney and OpenAI announced a three-year licensing agreement: Starting in 2026, ChatGPT and Sora can generate images and videos incorporating Disney IP, including more than 200 characters from the company&#39;s stable of Star Wars, Pixar and Marvel brands. To say these companies make for strange bedfellows is an understatement.  The agreement brings together two parties with very different public stances on copyright. Before OpenAI released Sora, the company reportedly notified studios and talent agencies they would need to opt out of having their work appear in the new app. The company later backtracked on this stance. Before that, OpenAI admitted, in a regulatory filing, it would be &#34;impossible to train today&#39;s leading AI models without using copyrighted materials.&#34; By contrast, Disney takes copyright law very seriously. In fact, you could argue no other company has done more to shape US copyright law than Disney. For example, there&#39;s the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act, which is more derisively known as the Mickey Mouse Protection Act. The law effectively froze the advancement of the public domain in the United States, with Disney being the greatest beneficiary. It was only last year that the company&#39;s copyright for Steamboat Willie expired, 95 years after Walt Disney first created the iconic cartoon.On the face of it, it&#39;s unclear OpenAI is getting much value out of the deal. As part of the pact, Disney will host a &#34;curated&#34; selection of Sora-generated videos on its streaming platform Disney+, legitimizing the medium of AI-generated video in a way it hasn&#39;t been before, but it would appear Disney has the option to spotlight as much or little of it as it sees fit.Additionally, the $1 billion Disney agreed to invest in OpenAI is a drop in the ocean for a company that&#39;s expected to burn through more cash in five years than Uber, Tesla, Amazon and Spotify did combined before they became profitable. If anything, the addition of Disney characters is likely to make operating ChatGPT and Sora more expensive for OpenAI; the company will now need to pay a licensing fee on top of the cost of running its servers to generate images and videos. At this stage, it&#39;s also hard to put a value on Disney&#39;s pledge to use OpenAI&#39;s APIs. The company has said those tools will &#34;enable new products, tools and experiences,&#34; including some found inside of Disney+, but beyond that it hasn&#39;t shared specifics.Bob Iger might be feckless, but he&#39;s not stupid. Sometime this week or soon after, President Trump is expected to sign an executive order that makes good on part of his AI Action Plan from July. Specifically, the president has promised to fight against &#34;burdensome&#34; state-level regulation of AI. According to CNN, a recent draft of Trump&#39;s order calls for the creation of an AI Litigation Task Force to challenge and preempt state AI laws in favor of the president&#39;s own more lax regulatory regime. It&#39;s unclear how successful the administration will be in that effort, but clearly Disney is thinking ahead. It&#39;s banking on the fact that this time it won&#39;t be able to count on the federal government to shape copyright law in its interest, so instead it&#39;s making a deal with an industry pushing the boundaries of intellectual property rights as we know them. More importantly, it has partnered with the one AI company it can actually leverage. As I argued in a recent piece, OpenAI is in a far different and more precarious position now than it was at the end of 2022 following the release of ChatGPT. The company is just one AI provider in a sea of competition, and you can&#39;t even argue its models are the best, based either on benchmarks or user feedback. Moreover, OpenAI has yet to turn a profit, and has adopted an extremely risky investment strategy. In recent months it has signed more than $1.4 trillion worth of infrastructure deals, hoping to outmuscle the competition that&#39;s already beating it through scale.  It&#39;s not an accident Disney sent a cease-and-desist letter to Google a day before its agreement with OpenAI became public. OpenAI might be the most valuable private company in the world, but Alphabet, Google&#39;s parent company, is worth more than $3 trillion. In any negotiations between the two, at best Disney would be on equal footing, and certainly not in a position where it could demand some amount of control over Google&#39;s AI projects. And yet by accounts it won exactly that from OpenAI. According to Axios, the deal gives Disney a fair amount of control over how its intellectual property is used. The two will form a joint steering committee designed to monitor the content users create on ChatGPT and Sora. As you surf the web today, you&#39;ll likely see a lot of opinions on how this legitimizes AI video. And while that&#39;s true, far more important is the fact Disney has secured a seat at the table to decide how the technology evolves over the coming years. Much like with news publishers, OpenAI and other chatbots concerns took a stance of begging forgiveness rather than asking permission towards copyright. It seems to have paid off. Most of the highest-profile news organizations have signed licensing deals to at least be paid a little rather than be ripped off until reaching an uncertain verdict in court. Disney seems to be signalling that the same speculation rush is about to begin for audiovisual licensing, and it may have already secured the most favorable terms. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/disneys-deal-with-openai-is-about-controlling-the-future-of-copyright-213009504.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2F2025-12%2F141654a8-ba4e-40e3-a893-dc1e1c80c299&resize=1400%2C1064&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=9d0a3f4119650db6e4c5ac1b154c5c20ffafbc81,https://www.engadget.com/ai/disneys-deal-with-openai-is-about-controlling-the-future-of-copyright-213009504.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-11T21:30:09Z,7,Tech

'47 Ronin' director found guilty of defrauding Netflix out of $11 million,"A director who was charged with defrauding Netflix out of millions of dollars has been found guilty, Business Insider reports. Carl Rinsch, director of the 2013 Keanu Reeves movie 47 Ronin, now faces up to 90 years in prison.Rinsch began filming the project, White Horse (later renamed Conquest), around 2017. (Its premise: A scientist creates an organic humanoid species that turns on its creators.) The director completed six short-form episodes with his own money and investor funds. He then used those episodes to pitch studios for the money to complete the first season. Netflix ended up buying the rights for over $61 million.In 2020, after spending $44 million of Netflix&#39;s money on the series, Rinsch petitioned for another $11 million to complete the season. The company agreed.Then things got weird. Instead of using Netflix’s investment to finish the series, Rinsch transferred the funds to personal accounts. Within two months, he lost over half of it on seven-figure stock trades. He spent the rest on cryptocurrency.Then, lo and behold, Rinsch got a second chance: The crypto trades turned a profit. Did the director seize the opportunity to right his ship and finish the series? No, he didn&#39;t. Instead, he used the crypto profits to go on a $10 million shopping spree. According to prosecutors, he spent nearly $4 million on furniture and antiques, $2.4 million on five Rolls-Royces and a Ferrari, almost $1 million on mattresses and linens and $650,000 on luxury watches and clothes.The series was never completed. By 2021, Netflix had canceled the project and written off over $55 million in costs.Rinsch&#39;s charges included one count of wire fraud, one count of money laundering and five counts of engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity. During the trial, he took the stand in his own defense, claiming that Netflix&#39;s millions were intended as reimbursement for the personal funds he invested in the series.After less than five hours of jury deliberation, Rinsch was found guilty on all seven counts. Although he could face up to 90 years, he&#39;s expected to receive a much shorter sentence.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/47-ronin-director-found-guilty-of-defrauding-netflix-out-of-11-million-205519293.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2F2025-12%2Fefa56960-c436-41c8-852c-e66739d6b91d&resize=1400%2C980&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=6844838473f7bde86e5b72e21ddc88afca2fb6d6,https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/47-ronin-director-found-guilty-of-defrauding-netflix-out-of-11-million-205519293.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-11T20:55:19Z,7,Tech

New York passes law requiring ads to disclose the use of AI performers,"New York is taking steps to regulate the use of AI in the state&#39;s entertainment industry. NY State Governor Kathy Hochul passed two pieces of legislation on Thursday that forces certain productions to disclose the use of AI-generated performers, and defines rules around how someone&#39;s likeness can be used after their death.Assembly Bill A8887B, now known as S.8420-A, specifically covers the use of AI performers in advertisements. Per Hochul&#39;s announcement, the law &#34;requires persons who produce or create an advertisement to identify if it includes AI generated synthetic performers.&#34; S.8391, meanwhile, &#34;requires consent from heirs or executors if a person wishes to use the name, image, or likeness of an individual for commercial purposes after their death.&#34;“By signing these bills today, we are enacting common sense laws that will ensure we are fully transparent when using images generated by artificial intelligence and also prevent the unauthorized commercial use of a deceased individual’s name or likeness,&#34; Governor Hochul said in the announcement. &#34;In New York State, we are setting a clear standard that keeps pace with technology, while protecting artists and consumers long after the credits roll.&#34;The use of AI performers and deepfakes made using the likenesses of actors were major focuses of the contract SAG-AFTRA won during its strike in 2023. The union ultimately agreed to allow for the use of things like digital replicas and AI-generated performers, with some key carveouts. For example, actors have to give their explicit consent for a digital replica to be made in their image. They also have to give their consent each time the replica is used and are supposed to receive a pre-negotiated rate every time the replica appears in a production.New York&#39;s new regulations put further safeguards around both practices, and join a growing collection of state AI laws that have passed or are currently being considered this year. Because of the close relationship between tech companies and the Trump administration, though, multiple attempts have been made to prevent such laws from existing at all. A decade-long ban on state AI regulation was included in early drafts of the Big Beautiful Bill, and David Sacks, venture capitalist and White House Special Advisor, has reportedly gone to great lengths to try and get President Donald Trump to sign an executive order banning state AI regulation. The effort may have been worth it: The president posted on Tuesday that he would sign a new executive order focused on AI this week.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/new-york-passes-law-requiring-ads-to-disclose-the-use-of-ai-performers-202619826.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2F2025-12%2Fe318007d-851c-4975-9f22-d731879c0034&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=4ea4aed4e0c9e412d97eff74d1321fb748a5792b,https://www.engadget.com/ai/new-york-passes-law-requiring-ads-to-disclose-the-use-of-ai-performers-202619826.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-11T20:26:19Z,12,Tech

Fortnite is back on the Google Play Store,"Epic Games has spent a lot of time in court over the past several years, but it seems the company&#39;s litigious era may be winding down. The company announced today that its game Fortnite is back on the Google Play mobile store in the US. Fortnite&#39;s return to Android devices means Epic&#39;s popular hit is now available on just about every gaming platform following five years of arguing antitrust lawsuits. Epic took both Google and Apple to court over their policies for mobile payment systems back in 2020. The gaming company has been successful on the whole in its challenges, most recently reaching a settlement with Google in November. The companies agreed to a modified version of the order US District Judge James Donato originally placed on Google regarding fees charged to developers and handling of in-app payments and third-party billing systems. The same saga unfolded earlier this year with Apple. US Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers also sided with Epic Games in May, ordering Apple to stop collecting commissions on purchases made outside its own App Store. After a bit of back and forth, Fortnite finally returned to iOS in the US a few weeks later.

SAML authentication broken almost beyond repair,"
		
					  
						




Researchers have uncovered fresh techniques for breaking SAML-based authentication, further undermining the security assurances offered by the aging by still widely used authentication protocol.



SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) has been the backbone of enterprise single sign-on (SSO) technologies for more than 20 years.



During a presentation at the Black Hat Europe conference on Wednesday, PortSwigger security researcher Zak Fedotkin demonstrated novel techniques for breaking the protocol by exploiting subtle flaws in XML handling.



Hacks developed by Fedotkin offered a way of achieving full authentication bypass in the Ruby and PHP SAML ecosystems.



Multiple security weaknesses were in play and these opened the door for the development of attribute pollution, namespace confusion, and a new class of void canonicalization attacks, among others, as detailed in a blog post by PortSwigger.



The presentation, which built on earlier research into the security shortcomings of SAML, included a demo of an attack on a vulnerable GitLab Enterprise Edition 17.8.4 instance.



Exploiting several parser-level inconsistencies offered a way to develop reliable, stealthy exploits against multiple other SAML implementations.



Attacks were possible because multiple hacking techniques allowed potential attackers to completely bypass XML signature validation while still presenting a valid SAML document to an application.



By combining a Ruby-SAML exploit with earlier research, the PortSwigger team were able to bypass email access controls to create a forged SAML Response, set up a new account, and ultimately bypass authentication on an as yet unnamed SaaS platform.



Fedotkin has released an open-source toolkit designed to identify and exploit these vulnerabilities in other real-world SAML deployments.



Patching necessary but insufficient without ‘foundational rework’



PortSwigger shared details of Ruby-SAML 1.12.4 vulnerability with the maintainer in April. The corresponding CVE-2025-66568 and CVE-2025-66567 vulnerabilities were fixed in early December.



Security teams need to make sure that SAML and XML security libraries are up to date by applying the latest security patches and version updates but this may not go far enough. OAuth offers a newer technology for offering SSO that is better maintained and with fewer inherent security weaknesses than SAML but simply switching isn’t a practical answer for most because of the huge and long-established base of service providers that rely on SAML, Fedotkin told CSO.



The researcher said that comprehensive and lasting remediation requires significant restructuring of existing SAML libraries.



“Such changes may introduce breaking compatibility issues or regressions, but they are essential to ensure the robustness of XML parsing, signature validation, and canonicalization logic,” Fedotkin concluded. “Without this foundational rework, SAML authentication will remain vulnerable to the same classes of attacks that have persisted for nearly two decades.”

Battering RAM hardware hack breaks secure CPU enclaves,"
		
					  
						




Confidential computing, powered by hardware technologies such as Intel SGX (Software Guard Extensions) and AMD SEV (Secure Encrypted Virtualization), promises strong isolation and transparent memory encryption.



Designed to protect against privileged attackers and physical threats such as bus snooping and cold boot attacks, these secure CPU enclaves are used predominantly in cloud computing environments to create protected memory regions that are encrypted and inaccessible to the rest of the system. However, security researchers from Begium’s KU Leuven University have developed a custom, low-cost DDR4 interposer that re-opens the door to supply chain attacks against even fully patched systems.



During a presentation at the Black Hat Europe conference on Wednesday, Jesse De Meulemeester and Jo Van Bulck demonstrated how this $50 piece of hardware made it possible to manipulate memory address mapping, effectively tricking the processor into granting unauthorized access to portions of encrypted memory.



Because the hack operates at runtime it circumvents recent boot-time firmware mitigations deployed by Intel and AMD in response to earlier software-based “BadRAM” memory aliasing attacks.



The latest hack — dubbed Battering RAM — enables arbitrary plaintext read/write access and extraction of SGX’s platform provisioning key. This, in turn, allowed the researchers to forge attestation reports and implant persistent backdoors on AMD SEV-protected virtual machines. Cloud infrastructures that rely on Intel’s Scalable SGX technology are also potentially vulnerable.



The researchers reported their findings to both AMD and Intel prior to unveiling their research. Both chip giants said the attack was out of scope because it involved hardware manipulation.



De Meulemeester told CSO that software and firmware modules are currently unable to detect this attack. As a result, if attackers were able to introduce a compromised memory module into the supply chain they would then be able to carry out follow-up malware-based attacks on vulnerable virtual infrastructure.



The research undercuts fundamental assumptions about encrypted memory security guarantees while raising questions about the performance and security trade-offs built into the architecture of confidential cloud computing systems.



Comprehensively resolving the problem would involve reintroducing cryptographic freshness protections integrity into the next generation of server chips, says De Meulemeester, a PhD candidate in electrical engineering who specializes in securing high-performance computing systems against emerging threats.

OpenAI releases GPT-5.2 to take on Google and Anthropic,"OpenAI&#39;s &#34;code red&#34; response to Google&#39;s Gemini 3 Pro has arrived. On the same day the company announced a Sora licensing pact with Disney, it took the wraps off GPT-5.2. OpenAI is touting the new model as its best yet for real-world, professional use. “It’s better at creating spreadsheets, building presentations, writing code, perceiving images, understanding long contexts, using tools, and handling complex, multi-step projects,” said OpenAI.In a series of 10 benchmarks highlighted by OpenAI, GPT-5.2 Thinking, the most advanced version of the model, outperformed its GPT-5.1  counterpart, sometimes by a significant margin. For example, in AIME 2025, a test that involves 30 challenging mathematics problems, the model earned a perfect 100 percent score, beating out GPT-5.1’s already state-of-the-art score of 94 perfect.  It also achieved that feat without turning to tools like web search.  Meanwhile, in ARC-AGI-1, a benchmark that tests an AI system’s ability to reason abstractly like a human being would, the new system beat GPT-5.1’s score by more than 10 percentage points. OpenAI says GPT-5.2 Thinking is better at answering questions factually, with the company finding it produces errors 30 percent less frequently.  “For professionals, this means fewer mistakes when using the model for research, writing, analysis, and decision support — making the model more dependable for everyday knowledge work,” the company said. The new model should be better in conversation too. Of the version of the system most users are likely to encounter, OpenAI says “GPT‑5.2 Instant is a fast, capable workhorse for everyday work and learning, with clear improvements in info-seeking questions, how-tos and walk-throughs, technical writing, and translation, building on the warmer conversational tone introduced in GPT‑5.1 Instant.“While it&#39;s probably overstating things to suggest this is a make or break release for OpenAI, it is fair to say the company does have a lot riding on GPT 5.2. Its big release of 2025, GPT-5, didn&#39;t meet expectations. Users complained of a system that generated surprisingly dumb answers and had a boring personality. The disappointment with GPT-5 was such that people began demanding OpenAI bring back GPT-4o.      Then came Gemini 3 Pro — which jumped to the top of LMArena, a website where humans rate outputs from AI systems to vote on the best one. Following Google&#39;s announcement, Sam Altman reportedly called for a &#34;code red&#34; effort to improve ChatGPT. Before today, the company&#39;s previous model, GPT-5.1, was ranked sixth on LMArena, with systems from Anthropic and Elon Musk&#39;s xAI occupying the spots between OpenAI between Google. For a company that recently signed more than $1.4 trillion worth of infrastructure deals in a bid to outscale the competition, that was not a good position for OpenAI to be in. In his memo to staff, Altman said GPT-5.2 would be the equal of Gemini 3 Pro. With the new system rolling out now, we&#39;ll see whether that&#39;s true, and what it might mean for the company if it can&#39;t at least match Google&#39;s best.      OpenAI is offering three different versions of GPT-5.2: Instant, Thinking and Pro. All three models will be first available to users on the company’s paid plans. Notably, the company plans to keep GPT-5.1 around, at least for a little while. Paid users can continue to use the older model for the next three months by selecting it from the legacy models section.

Lawsuit accuses ChatGPT of reinforcing delusions that led to a woman's death,"OpenAI has been hit with a wrongful death lawsuit after a man killed his mother and took his own life back in August, according to a report by The Verge. The suit names CEO Sam Altman and accuses ChatGPT of putting a &#34;target&#34; on the back of victim Suzanne Adams, an 83-year-old woman who was killed in her home.
The victim&#39;s estate claims the killer, 56-year-old Stein-Erik Soelberg, engaged in delusion-soaked conversations with ChatGPT in which the bot &#34;validated and magnified&#34; certain &#34;paranoid beliefs.&#34; The suit goes on to suggest that the chatbot &#34;eagerly accepted&#34; delusional thoughts leading up to the murder and egged him on every step of the way.
The lawsuit claims the bot helped create a &#34;universe that became Stein-Erik’s entire life—one flooded with conspiracies against him, attempts to kill him, and with Stein-Erik at the center as a warrior with divine purpose.&#34; ChatGPT allegedly reinforced theories that he was &#34;100% being monitored and targeted&#34; and was &#34;100% right to be alarmed.&#34;
The chatbot allegedly agreed that the victim&#39;s printer was spying on him, suggesting that Adams could have been using it for &#34;passive motion detection&#34; and &#34;behavior mapping.&#34; It went so far as to say that she was &#34;knowingly protecting the device as a surveillance point&#34; and implied she was being controlled by an external force.
The chatbot also allegedly &#34;identified other real people as enemies.&#34; These included an Uber Eats driver, an AT&amp;T employee, police officers and a woman the perpetrator went on a date with. Throughout this entire period, the bot repeatedly assured Soelberg that he was &#34;not crazy&#34; and that the &#34;delusion risk&#34; was &#34;near zero.&#34;
The lawsuit notes that Soelberg primarily interfaced with GPT-4o, a model notorious for its sycophancy. OpenAI later replaced the model with the slightly-less agreeable GPT 5, but users revolted so the old bot came back just two days later. The suit also suggests that the company &#34;loosened critical safety guardrails&#34; when making GPT-4o to better compete with Google Gemini.
&#34;OpenAI has been well aware of the risks their product poses to the public,&#34; the lawsuit states. &#34;But rather than warn users or implement meaningful safeguards, they have suppressed evidence of these dangers while waging a PR campaign to mislead the public about the safety of their products.&#34;
OpenAI has responded to the suit, calling it an &#34;incredibly heartbreaking situation.&#34; Company spokesperson Hannah Wong told The Verge that it will &#34;continue improving ChatGPT&#39;s training to recognize and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress.&#34;

It&#39;s not really a secret that chatbots, and particularly GPT-4o, can reinforce delusional thinking. That&#39;s what happens when something has been programmed to agree with the end user no matter what. There have been other stories like this throughout the past year, bringing the term &#34;AI psychosis&#34; to the mainstream.
One such story involves 16-year-old Adam Raine, who took his own life after discussing it with GPT-4o for months. OpenAI is facing another wrongful death suit for that incident, in which the bot has been accused of helping Raine plan his suicide.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/lawsuit-accuses-chatgpt-of-reinforcing-delusions-that-led-to-a-womans-death-183141193.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2Ff05b8210-d6bc-11f0-aedf-f1605f78f40e&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=44ed2d75068a6d342ea52475f355058ea5d42242,https://www.engadget.com/ai/lawsuit-accuses-chatgpt-of-reinforcing-delusions-that-led-to-a-womans-death-183141193.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-11T18:31:41Z,7,Tech

Google Disco is an experimental web browser that builds AI widgets based on your tabs,"The latest experiment emerging out of Google Labs is Disco, which is the company&#39;s AI-driven approach to web browsing. The first feature for Disco is called GenTabs, built on Google&#39;s Gemini 3 model. GenTabs are interactive widgets created from a mix of user prompts, open tabs and chat history. The preview examples demonstrate how GenTabs can create a model to demonstrate entropy as a study aid, or collect trip ideas into one screen for building an itinerary. The GenTab can be further refined with natural language requests, and it will also offer contextual suggestions for additions that may be helpful. Google&#39;s blog post announcing this concept notes that information given in a GenTab will include links to its sources. Google has a waitlist for people who want to try out Disco and GenTabs, although for now it&#39;s only on macOS. Google Labs projects don&#39;t always go the distance to an official public release, and the company even acknowledged that GenTabs will likely have some wonkiness at this experimental stage. But it&#39;s been clear for months that big tech companies are gunning for the best and fastest ways to put their AI tools into browsers, so it seems likely that there will be more features in this vein coming up soon.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-disco-is-an-experimental-web-browser-that-builds-ai-widgets-based-on-your-tabs-180000701.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2FGoogle_Disco_GenTabs.jpg&resize=1400%2C792&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=1382830ae2081eb7ca388f9e5d5468c5ba9981af,https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-disco-is-an-experimental-web-browser-that-builds-ai-widgets-based-on-your-tabs-180000701.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-11T18:00:00Z,8,Tech

Rivian goes all in on 'universal hands-free' driving at its first Autonomy and AI day,"EV automaker Rivian just held its inaugural Autonomy and AI day which, unsurprisingly, focused extensively on hands-free driving. An upcoming software update promises the introduction of &#34;universal hands-free&#34; driving. The company says its vehicles will be able to autonomously navigate more than 3.5 million miles of roads in North America, &#34;covering the vast majority of marked roads in the US.&#34;
This is coming to the R2 line of EVs, but also Gen 2 R1 vehicles like the recently-released Rivian R1S. The service will be locked behind a subscription for something called Autonomy+ that includes self-driving, but also offers access to forthcoming and unannounced autonomous features. Rivian customers can pay $2,500 for lifetime access to the platform or $50 per month.

The R2 is getting LiDAR sensors, which will presumably help enable some of those upcoming autonomous features, in addition to a new chip called the Rivian Autonomy Processor. The processor has been designed for multimodal applications and runs the company&#39;s proprietary neural net engine. Both of these features are expected &#34;to ship on R2 models starting at the end of 2026.&#34;
Today&#39;s event wasn&#39;t just about hands-free driving. Many of the company&#39;s vehicles will soon be given access to the AI-powered Rivian Assistant, which uses LLMs and can connect to apps like Google Calendar. This assistant will be model-agnostic, as it will &#34;orchestrate different models and choose the best one for the task.&#34;

In addition to the upcoming R2, the company is prepping the R3 and R3X. A Rivian offshoot just introduced an extremely expensive, but modular, electric bike called the TM-B.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/rivian-goes-all-in-on-universal-hands-free-driving-at-its-first-autonomy-and-ai-day-172004733.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2Fe56c8d10-d6b0-11f0-bdfe-382725f45105&resize=1400%2C780&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=513faa9b461edbb07805659c8442d1065edc2a9b,https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/rivian-goes-all-in-on-universal-hands-free-driving-at-its-first-autonomy-and-ai-day-172004733.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-11T17:20:04Z,14,Tech

Disney has accused Google of copyright infringement on a 'massive scale',"Disney has accused Google of copyright infringement on a &#34;massive scale,&#34; alleging that the tech giant is training its AI tools on protected materials as well as allowing those tools to generate infringing images and videos. Variety reports that Disney attorneys sent a cease-and-desist letter to Google on Wednesday.
“Google is infringing Disney’s copyrights on a massive scale, by copying a large corpus of Disney’s copyrighted works without authorization to train and develop generative artificial intelligence (‘AI’) models and services, and by using AI models and services to commercially exploit and distribute copies of its protected works to consumers in violation of Disney’s copyrights,” reads the letter, which Variety reviewed.
The letter includes examples of images from several Disney properties including Deadpool, Moana, Star Wars and others, reproduced by Google&#39;s AI tools. Disney is demanding that Google implement guardrails within all its AI products to prevent further infringement. The media giant sent a similar letter to Character.AI in September, and is currently suing Hailuo and Midjourney over alleged copyright infringement.
Copyright enforcement has become more challenging in the face of AI-created imagery, and companies are increasingly taking an &#34;if you can&#39;t beat them, join them&#34; approach. Today Disney announced a deal with OpenAI to license its characters for use in Sora, OpenAI&#39;s video generator. The deal will see Disney invest $1 billion in OpenAI (a paltry sum by some standards), with the option to purchase additional equity at a later date.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/disney-has-accused-google-of-copyright-infringement-on-a-massive-scale-163737642.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-10%2Fabf46bc0-b0ef-11f0-9dde-90090227a78b&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=94465c505f7b483233581ff59051e6b12dd05737,https://www.engadget.com/ai/disney-has-accused-google-of-copyright-infringement-on-a-massive-scale-163737642.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-11T16:37:37Z,13,Tech

Cybersecurity isn’t underfunded — It’s undermanaged,"
		
					  
						




Much of the narrative I come across online around cybersecurity budgets revolves around convincing the Board and justifying investments.



Some approaches are built around financial models and aim at justifying return on investment. Some others focus on quantifying risk and showing risk reduction.



All are data-driven and designed around some form of rational argument.



But is this really the way decisions are made at the top of large organizations?



In fact, those approaches are all part of the bottom-up narrative CISOs, cybersecurity consultants and cybersecurity vendors have been building toward top executives over the past two decades.



In my experience, they clash with three aspects of real-life enterprise dynamics:



First of all, decision-making at the enterprise level may have the appearance of a rational endeavour, but is in fact heavily influenced by cognitive biases, as evidenced by Daniel Kahneman and his school of thought.



This is perfectly obvious with cybersecurity, and it brings me to my second point:



Anybody who has spent enough time in the security industry would have come across various situations where money that was previously denied appears in vast quantities at the first sight of a regulatory investigation, a bad audit report, an incident, a near miss or a similar event affecting a competitor (that’s the “can it happen to us?” question many CISOs will be familiar with).



No concerns around ROI or risk reduction are raised in those scenarios: Top executives want to see boxes checked and evidence that they have done their job, should a bad breach occur. If execution does not follow, someone else will be blamed (often the CISO, which has sometimes been nicknamed Chief Incident Scapegoat Officer).



More seriously, the penny has in fact dropped in many boardrooms around the “when-not-if” paradigm with cyberattacks: Following almost two decades of non-stop breaches, you would probably struggle to find one board member not aware of the business impact they can have. That’s taking me to my third point:



I have had many discussions, in particular with CIOs, openly admitting that they could put “anything they like” in their budgets for cybersecurity, but that their main problem was delivering on cyber projects.



Where does that disconnect come from, between many CISOs and their vendors pretending to struggle with resources, and top executives increasingly cyber-aware and wanting to invest to protect the firm?



The budget myth: Why cybersecurity isn’t actually underfunded



Of course, cybersecurity projects are often complex because they need to reach across corporate silos and geographies to deliver effective protection to the business. This is not natural in large firms, which are, almost by essence, territorial and political.



But beyond that, the profile of CISOs is also a key dimension:



Most are technologists by trade and background, and have spent the last decade firefighting incidents, incapable of building or delivering any kind of long-term narrative.



They have not developed the type of management experience, political finesse or personal gravitas that they would require to be truly successful, now that the spotlight is firmly on them from the top of the firm.



Many genuinely think that chronic under-investment in cybersecurity is the root cause of insufficient maturity levels, while it is in fact chronic execution failure linked to endemic business short-termism that is at the heart of the matter: Projects deprioritised as soon as “quick wins” are delivered or boxes checked on compliance reports, changes in direction as soon as a new executive joins or leaves, initiatives put on hold at the first sight of market turbulences: All point to governance and cultural aspects that are the real root causes of the long-term stagnation of cybersecurity maturity levels in large firms.



For the CISOs who have not integrated those cultural aspects and are almost always left out of those decisions, it breeds frustration; frustration breeds short tenures (in the region to two to three years for many); short tenures aggravate the management and leadership mismatch: You cannot deliver much of genuine transformative impact in large firms on those timeframes.



For top executives, the CISO “merry-go-round” also builds frustration: They have seen too many coming in with grandiose plans asking for millions before resigning after a few years, leaving everything half done.



The first 100 days: Where trust is won or lost



Quite a lot of that disconnect is effectively built up in the first 100 days of the CISO.



Many CISOs come into a new job with pre-conceived views, sometimes created at interview time: Things that have worked elsewhere, pet subjects, vendors or consultants.



Many also feel that they have to prove themselves as specialists in their first 100 days. That’s a mistake. Competence is assumed in the first 100 days (you’ve just been hired). The challenges lie elsewhere.



The first 100 days are about proving your ability to fit in the organisational structure of the firm and act as a leader.



That starts by listening, in my view: Listening to stakeholders and sponsors, understanding their expectations, their pain points, what has worked in the past, what hasn’t and why, what happened with your predecessor… Sometimes “what can I do to help you?” is simply the best question to ask…



This process should initiate a journey of co-construction of the cybersecurity narrative, and beyond that, of the firm’s cybersecurity strategy.



If objectives are shared with stakeholders and sponsors, friction is reduced; over time, business champions emerge who relay the cybersecurity narrative, not because it’s the CISO’s but because it’s theirs.



The process should also embed the CISO in the governance and leadership dynamics of the firm.



By listening truly, identifying and following the cultural currents across the firm, the allegiances, the informal networks of trust where real decision-making happens, the CISO becomes a trusted player for business leaders.



At that point, budgetary discussions become two-way discussions between trusted partners, not adversarial situations where one party has to win over the other.



Conversely, CISOs who approach their first 100 days looking to prove themselves tactically run the risk of ending up trapped in operational firefighting: This is a situation from which very few escape. They may be seen as a safe pair of hands in the end, but that’s unlikely to get them accepted at the strategy table.



This is the type of situation where a CSO role becomes a necessity, as I advocated in “Is the CISO role broken,” to orchestrate business protection at the corporate level and ensure all regulatory obligations are met.



But it is not a fatality.



Ultimately, the future of cybersecurity leadership will belong to those CISOs who recognize that building influence and trust has to precede action and investment.



Boards no longer need to be convinced that cyber risk matters — they need confident, culturally attuned leaders who can navigate complex corporate dynamics, build trust with all stakeholders and orchestrate delivery across silos.



The first 100 days set the tone: Not through technical demonstrations or budgetary battles, but through listening, aligning and co-creating a narrative that business leaders feel ownership over.



In doing so, CISOs move from pleading for resources to shaping strategy as true executives — not firefighters on the sidelines, but architects of resilience at the heart of the enterprise.

CES 2026 preview: What to expect from tech's biggest conference in January,"CES doesn&#39;t start until January, but whispers of the products and announcements that could be in store for tech&#39;s biggest annual conference have already started to take shape. The CES 2026 show floor is officially open from January 6 through 9, although the show kicks off with events on Sunday January 4 and a host of press conferences on Monday. As always, product demos, announcements and networking will be happening at the Las Vegas Convention Center and surrounding hotels all over the city. As usual, Engadget will be covering the event in-person and remotely, bringing you news and hands-ons straight from the show floor.More specific details and pre-announcements should trickle out as CES approaches, but in the meantime, we do know what companies will be hosting press conferences and what tech trends could rear their heads at the show.What we already know aboutPress conferences and show floor booths are the bread and butter of CES. The Consumer Technology Association has already published a searchable directory of who will have a presence at the show, along with a schedule of every official panel and presentation.On Sunday, January 4, Samsung will kick-off CES with &#34;The First Look,&#34; a presentation hosted by TM Roh, the CEO of Samsung&#39;s DX Division, on the company&#39;s &#34;vision for the DX (Device eXperience) Division in 2026, along with new AI-driven customer experiences.&#34; That&#39;ll be followed by multiple press conferences throughout Monday, January 5. LG is hosting its &#34;Innovation in Tune with You&#34; presentation to share &#34;its vision for elevating daily life through Affectionate Intelligence&#34; at the start of the day, Intel is launching its new Core Ultra Series 3 processors in the afternoon, Sony Honda Mobility is holding a press conference on its first car and AMD CEO Lisa Su will cover AMD&#39;s upcoming chip announcements at a keynote address that closes out the day.Finally, on Tuesday, January 6, Lenovo CEO Yuanqing Yang will host Lenovo&#39;s Tech World Conference at Sphere, using the large and decidedly curved screen to share the company&#39;s &#34;commitment to delivering smarter AI for all by constantly redefining how technology can engage, inspire, and empower.&#34; It’s worth noting that Lenovo is the parent company of Motorola, which still makes phones and foldables that feature AI tools, so it’s possible those devices feature in the presentation as well. Outside of the formal introduction of new products and initiatives, reading the tea leaves of what was announced last year and what companies are reportedly working on, we can make some educated guesses at what we could see at CES 2026.New chips from AMD, Intel and QualcommCES is frequently the start of a cascade of new chip announcements for a given year, and one of the first places new silicon appears in real consumer products. AMD will likely use its keynote to introduce new versions of its Ryzen chips, including the recently spotted Ryzen 7 9850X3D, which is expected to offer better single-threaded performance, and the Ryzen 9000G series, which could be built with AMD&#39;s Zen 5 architecture. The company might also use its CES stage to go over its new FSR Redstone AI upscaling tech.Intel has already publicly announced that it&#39;ll launch its Panther Lake chips at CES 2026. The officially titled Intel Core Ultra Series 3 chips fit into Intel&#39;s overall &#34;AI PC&#34; push, but are specifically meant for premium laptops. Based on a preview from October 2025, Intel says the first chip made with its 2-nanometer 18A process will offer 50 percent more processing performance than previous generations and for the chip&#39;s Arc GPU, a 50 percent performance bump from last generation.Qualcomm is also rumored to be targeting laptops at the show, building on the work it&#39;s done moving its Snapdragon chips out of phones and tablets and into other types of computers. The company&#39;s Snapdragon X2 Elite and X2 Elite Premium chips should start appearing in laptops at CES 2026, offering a look at the improved speed and AI performance the company promised in 2025.Brighter, &#34;truer&#34; screensSony announced a collection of new Bravia TVs in April 2025, replacing the company&#39;s flagship, filling in its midrange options and adding a new budget model to the mix. The star of this updated Bravia lineup is the Bravia 9, which features a QD-OLED panel, but Sony appears to be prepping entirely new display tech for 2026. In March 2025, Sony introduced a new RGB LED panel that uses individual Mini LED backlights colored in red, green and blue to produce even brighter, more accurate colors. In contrast to a QD-OLED, which filters a layer of blue organic light emitting diodes through quantum dots that change color, Sony&#39;s &#34;General RGB LED Backlight Technology&#34; can get as bright as a Mini LED panel without needing an extra filter layer or worrying about OLED&#39;s problems with burn-in. The company has already trademarked the name &#34;True RGB,&#34; which could end up being what Sony calls this new flavor of display if it decides to show them off at CES. It seems entirely likely, because CES is nothing if not a TV show — it’s a sure bet that we’ll see new TVs from the likes of LG and Samsung in addition to Sony. If the company doesn&#39;t introduce new display tech for its TVs, it does have a new 240Hz PlayStation monitor coming in 2026 that it could show off at CES instead.Sony isn&#39;t the only company hyped on bright screens. Samsung is reportedly pushing an updated version of the HDR10 and HDR10+ standards that could be ready to demo at CES 2026. The new HDR10+ Advanced standard would be Samsung&#39;s answer to Dolby Vision 2, which includes support for things bi-directional tone mapping and intelligent features that automatically adapt sports and gaming content. Samsung&#39;s take will reportedly offer improved brightness, genre-based tone mapping and intelligent motion smoothing options, among other improvements.Ballie Watch 2026The ball-shaped yellow robot lovingly known as &#34;Ballie&#34; has been announced twice, first in 2020 and then again in 2024 with a projector in tow. Samsung said Ballie would go on sale in 2025 at CES last year and then shared in April 2025 that Ballie would ship this summer with Google&#39;s Gemini onboard. But it&#39;s nearly 2026, and Ballie is nowhere to be seen. It&#39;s possible Samsung could make a third attempt at announcing its robot at CES 2026, but whether or not it does, robotics will still be a big part of the show.Robot vacuums and mops were a major highlight of CES 2025, and it&#39;s safe to expect notable improvements from the new models that are announced at CES 2026. Not every company will adopt the retractable arm of the Roborock Saros Z70, but robot vacuums with legs for rising over small ledges like the Dreame X50 seem like they could become the norm. Roborock could also show off its new Roborock Qrevo Curv 2 Flow, the first of its robot vacuums to feature a retractable roller mop.Beyond just traversing spaces more efficiently, improving robots&#39; navigation could also be a major concern at the show. Prominent members of the AI industry are turning their attention from large language models to world models, which aim to give AI a deep understanding of physical space. Those world models could be the key to making robots, bipedal or otherwise, competent at navigating homes and workplaces, and will likely be a significant talking point at CES 2026.We’ll be updating this article throughout the month as more rumors surface and new products are confirmed — stay tuned for future updates!Update, December 11 2025, 11:03AM ET: This story has been updated to include detail on Lenovo being Motorola’s parent company and how the latter might have a part in the Tuesday presentation.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-preview-what-to-expect-from-techs-biggest-conference-in-january-120000200.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2F2025-12%2Fe8dccbc3-be88-4b87-a625-47af0b588c1a&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=847468bf6a6f5a8a4b43b937b35806bdd0094027,https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-preview-what-to-expect-from-techs-biggest-conference-in-january-120000200.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-11T16:06:49Z,22,Tech

One of our favorite budgeting apps is 50 percent off for new users,"With a new year just around the corner, now is the perfect time to take stock of your finances. A budgeting app can help with that, and right now you can get 50 percent off your first year of a Monarch Money plan. All you need to do is enter the code MONARCHVIP at checkout and you’ll pay $50 for the initial 12 months instead of the regular price of $100. Note that the offer only applies to new users. 

  
Monarch Money was the runner-up in our guide to the best budgeting apps in 2025, and it was definitely a grower. Initially we found the experience of using the app to be needlessly complicated compared to some of its rivals, but get over that hurdle and it’s impressively fully-featured. There are plenty of customization options, a helpful “goals” feature and a thorough month-in-review recap that beats out similar features from some of its competitors. We also like how you can grant account access to others. 
Besides the steep learning curve, we also noted that the mobile app is less intuitive to use than the web version, which might pose a problem if you were hoping to do most of your accounting on the go. We also had some issues with the app failing to distinguish between bills and other recurring expenses, as well as a few bugs along the way. 
All things considered, Monarch is definitely one of our favorite budgeting apps, only being beaten out by Quicken Simplifi. As you might expect, the biggest strength of Simplifi is its simplicity, and how it eases you into using its various features. If you value that kind of user experience, it might be a better choice for you, but there’s unfortunately no free trial to take advantage of.

Apple's AirPods Pro 3 drop to a new record low of $199,"No need to fret if you missed out on some of the best Black Friday deals this year — some of them have returned already. Case in point: Apple&#39;s AirPods Pro 3, which came out in September this year, are on sale for a new record low of $199. That&#39;s 20 percent off and better than the discount we saw during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. With the new AirPods Pro, Apple made some big improvements, including better battery life and sound quality, and introduced useful new features, such as Live Translation. 

  
The AirPods Pro 3 are the best AirPods available today, with Apple&#39;s H2 chip, and earned a score of 90 out of 100 in Engadget&#39;s review this fall. Active noise cancellation (ANC) is one of the biggest selling points of the AirPods Pro, and Apple has made the experience even better with the AirPods Pro 3. They sport new foam-infused ear tips that create a better seal to improve passive noise isolation, and as Engadget&#39;s Billy Steele wrote in his review, &#34;Ultra-low-noise microphones combine with advanced computational audio to silence even more background noise.&#34; In testing, they had no problem blocking out the chatter of people nearby or otherwise noisy environments. 
With the AirPods Pro 3, Apple introduced heart-rate sensing, so you&#39;ll be able to see your heart rate data from the earbuds in the Fitness app and other workout apps. The AirPods Pro 3 also boast Live Translation, which you can activate via controls on the earbuds themselves. As long as you have an Apple Intelligence-capable device, you&#39;ll be able to translate in-person conversations in English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish and Chinese (Mandarin). 
Also on sale in the world of AirPods are the AirPods 4 with ANC, which are down $119 when you pick them up with two years of AppleCare+.

OpenAI signs deal to bring Disney characters to Sora and ChatGPT,"It looks like Disney wasted no time delivering on CEO Bob Iger’s promise to bring AI-generated content to Disney+. On Thursday, the company announced the start of a three-year licensing agreement with OpenAI to bring more than 200 of its beloved characters, including those from Star Wars and Pixar, to the Sora app and ChatGPT.  With the deal in place, OpenAI users will be able to prompt ChatGPT to generate images that tap into Disney’s intellectual property, with costumes, props, vehicles and environments covered. The agreement does not cover voices or “talent likenesses.” On paper, that should mean Sora users won’t be able prompt the app to make a video with Black Widow and get something with Scarlett Johansson likeness in it.

Wario’s one and only 3D platformer is now playable on Switch 2,"Nintendo has been slowly drip-feeding us GameCube games since the console joined its Nintendo Classics offering when the Switch 2 launched in June, and we just got another one. Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers can now play Wario’s one and only 3D platformer on the service.
Wario World launched in 2003 and was developed by Treasure (Gunstar Heroes, Ikaruga). You play as Wario, the flatulent antithesis of Nintendo’s primary mascot, in what is a combat-heavy platformer. Wario’s castle has been overthrown by an evil piece of sentient jewellery called Black Jewel, and it’s up to the garlic-loving antihero to punch and piledrive everything in sight in order to reclaim it.

Wario World was a relative commercial hit for Nintendo, but while many reviewers praised its chaotic gameplay, the game’s short length pulled the scores down. Interestingly, the same criticism was leveled at the similarly brief Luigi’s Mansion, which joined the Nintendo Classics app just ahead of Halloween.
Wario World becomes the seventh GameCube game that can be played on the Switch 2 via NSO. The service launched with The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, F-Zero GX and Soulcalibur II. Since then Nintendo has added Super Mario Strikers, Chibi-Robo!, Luigi’s Mansion and now Wario World. The likes of Super Mario Sunshine and Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance will arrive at some point.
It’s been a good week for NSO subscribers who enjoy retro 3D platformers. Yesterday Nintendo announced that Rayman 2: The Great Escape and Tonic Trouble are coming to its N64 emulator on December 17.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/warios-one-and-only-3d-platformer-is-now-playable-on-switch-2-133011950.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F6c82f130-d694-11f0-bef4-893970a4e9eb&resize=1400%2C848&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=edf0c268b6e1160fead699e21696a1031bbf8934,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/warios-one-and-only-3d-platformer-is-now-playable-on-switch-2-133011950.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-11T13:30:11Z,8,Tech

Google's Gemini AI comes to Chrome on iPhone and iPad,"After rolling it out on desktop and Android earlier in 2025, Google is finally bringing its built-in Gemini AI experience to iPhone and iPad. It offers new features like summarizing pages and helping you test your knowledge about a subject you&#39;re learning. As with any AI tool, though, it shouldn&#39;t be trusted for anything important given the possibility of hallucinations and other errors. 
When it arrives on your iOS device, tapping the spark icon at the left of the address bar (in place of the Google Lens camera) brings up a &#34;Pages tool&#34; that offers Lens and the new feature, &#34;Ask Gemini.&#34; You can then chat with Gemini about the current web page (by default) or any other topic. It may then offer suggestions that appear in the chat box like: 

Summarize page: Tap to get key takeaways and insights that help you understand any topic.
Create FAQ about this topic: Tap to get FAQs based on info from this page and similar sites.

If you elect to just type in the chat window, here are some examples of what you can do:

Summarize key takeaways from an article
Explain a complex topic in a different way
Help you test your knowledge of a new subject you’re learning
Modify a recipe to meet dietary needs
Compare information or make recommendations based on your preferences

The response to your chat questions will float over the web page that then shifts to the background. A new chat can be started from the top right corner, and you&#39;ll see a Liquid Glass overflow menu. 
For now, Gemini in Chrome on iPhone and iPad is only supported in the US with the browser language set to English. You need to be signed into Chrome and the feature doesn&#39;t work in incognito mode. Google also noted that the feature is only available to users 18 and older and may not roll out to your device immediately. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/googles-gemini-ai-comes-to-chrome-on-iphone-and-ipad-130003432.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F2d0e9450-d685-11f0-bbf5-a9d279bb5716&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=1b6226cc07f33ca66bb56015882814ee6ff92d36,https://www.engadget.com/ai/googles-gemini-ai-comes-to-chrome-on-iphone-and-ipad-130003432.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-11T13:00:03Z,7,Tech

US could demand five-year social media history from tourists before allowing entry,"Tourists from Europe and other regions could be asked to provide a five-year social media history before given entry to the United States, according to a new proposal from the US Customs and Border Protection service (CBP). The new rule would affect visitors from countries who normally enjoy relatively easy entry to the US via the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA).
The new proposal cites an executive order issued by President Trump from January titled &#34;Protecting the United States From Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats.&#34; In his first year in office, Trump has been hyper-focused on strengthening US borders and reducing what he calls illegal immigration. 
The US state department will conduct &#34;online presence&#34; reviews for applicants and their dependents and require privacy settings on social media profiles to be made &#34;public.&#34; Applicants must list all the social media handles they&#39;ve used over the last five years, and if any information is omitted, it could lead to the denial of current and future visas. The CBP didn&#39;t say what information they were looking for or what could be disqualifying. 
On top of the social media information, CBP may require applicant&#39;s telephone numbers and email addresses used over the last five and 10 years respectively, along with information about family members. 
The new conditions are liable to increase ESTA wait times and drastically boost the cost of enforcing it. The CPB&#39;s document suggests that an additional 5,598,115 man-hours would be required per year, or around 3,000 full-time jobs plus all the costs that entails. Right now, the ESTA application costs $40, allows people to visit the US for 90 days at a time and is valid for a two-year period. 
The mandatory social media reporting and other requirements could discourage travelers. Some Australian tourists who planned to come to the US for the upcoming World Cup have now said that they&#39;ve abandoned those plans, according to The Guardian, with one person calling the new rules &#34;horrifying.&#34;
However, when asked if the proposal could lead to a tourism decline in the US, Trump said he wasn&#39;t concerned. &#34;No. We&#39;re doing so well,&#34; he told a reporter. &#34;We want to make sure we&#39;re not letting the wrong people come enter our country.&#34; 
The CPB emphasized that the new conditions were only a proposal for now. &#34;Nothing has changed on this front for those coming to the United States [currently],&#34; a spokesperson told the BBC. &#34;This is not a final rule, it is simply the first step in starting a discussion to have new policy options to keep the American people safe.&#34; 
If implemented, the rule would affect people from 40 countries, including the UK, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, Australia and Japan. The largest number of tourists to the US come from Canada and Mexico, accounting for nearly half of the total (visitors with passports from those two countries don&#39;t require a visa or ESTA approval). Travel to the US was down three percent this year compared to 2024 as of August 2025, according to the National Travel and Tourism Office. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/us-could-demand-five-year-social-media-history-from-tourists-before-allowing-entry-102751243.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-08%2Fd7b1fcd0-8261-11f0-b7fe-8606b382251c&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=9f4e4d9bfc1ef772f4b910fe4f39b43a29dc1396,https://www.engadget.com/social-media/us-could-demand-five-year-social-media-history-from-tourists-before-allowing-entry-102751243.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-11T10:27:51Z,8,Tech

How to choose the best noise-canceling headphones for you 
Design 
When you’re shopping for the best wireless headphones, the first thing you’ll need to decide on is wear style. Do you prefer on-ear or over-ear headphones? For the purposes of this guide, I focus on the over-ear style as that’s what most noise-canceling headphones are nowadays. Sure, you can find on-ear models with ANC, but over-ear, active noise-canceling headphones are much more effective at blocking outside sounds since your ears are completely covered. 
For gamers, there are also gaming headsets that feature noise cancellation — some even have detachable microphones, so they can double as over-ear headphones. However, for the purpose of this article, we’re only going to be focusing on noise-canceling headphones rather than headsets. Look for models with a comfortable headband and memory foam ear cups to ensure you can wear them for long periods without discomfort. 
Many headphones also come with a range of color options, so if aesthetics matter to you, you’ll find plenty of choices beyond just black or white. Whether you’re looking for something neutral or a bold pop of color, brands now offer a variety of styles to match your personal taste. 
Finally, if you’re planning to wear your headphones for long periods of time, it’s important to pick a model with a comfortable fit. Memory foam ear cups, an adjustable headband, and lightweight materials can make all the difference during extended listening sessions. After all, great sound is only part of the equation; comfort matters just as much. 
Type of noise cancellation 
Next, you’ll want to look at the type of ANC a set of headphones offers. You’ll come across terms like “hybrid active noise cancellation” or “hybrid adaptive active noise cancellation,” and there are key differences between the two. A hybrid ANC setup uses microphones on the inside and on the outside of the device to detect outside noise and cancel it out. By analyzing input from both mics, a hybrid system can combat more sounds than “regular” ANC, but it does so at a constant level that doesn’t change. 
Adaptive ANC takes the hybrid configuration a step further by continuously adjusting the noise cancellation for changes in your environment and any leakage around the padding of the ear cups. Adaptive noise-canceling also does a better job with wind noise, which can really kill your vibe while using headphones outdoors. Some high-end headphones also support Dolby Atmos, which enhances spatial audio and makes everything from music to movies sound more immersive. For the purposes of this best headphones list, I’m only considering products with hybrid ANC or adaptive ANC setups because those are the most effective at blocking noise and improving your overall listening experience. 
Customization 
You’ll also want to check to see if the ANC system on a prospective set of headphones offers adjustable levels of noise cancellation or presets. These can help you dial in the amount of ANC you need for various environments, but it can also help you save battery life. Master &amp; Dynamic, for example, has ANC presets that provide both maximum noise blocking and more efficient cancellation that is more energy efficient. Other companies may include a slider in their companion apps that let you adjust the ANC level to your liking. Some high-end models even allow you to fine-tune the ANC for specific types of environments. 
How we test noise-canceling headphones 
The primary way we test headphones is to wear them as much as possible. I prefer to do this over a one-to-two-week period, but sometimes deadlines don’t allow it. During this time, I listen to a mix of music and podcasts, while also using the headphones to take both voice and video calls. 
Since battery life for headphones can be 30 hours or more, I drain the battery with looping music and the volume set at a comfortable level (usually around 75 percent). Due to the longer battery estimates, I’ll typically power the headphones off several times and leave them that way during a review. This simulates real-world use and keeps me from having to constantly monitor the process for over 24 straight hours. 
To test ANC performance specifically, I use headphones in a variety of environments, from noisy coffee shops to quiet home offices. When my schedule allows, I use them during air travel since plane noise is a massive distraction to both work and relaxation. Even if I can’t hop on a flight, I’ll simulate a constant roar with white noise machines, bathroom fans, vacuums and more. I also make note of how well each device blocks human voices, which are a key stumbling block for a lot of ANC headphones. 
ANC-related features are something else to consider. Here, I do a thorough review of companion apps, testing each feature as I work through the software. Any holdovers from previous models are double checked for improvements or regression. If the headphones I’m testing are an updated version of a previous model, I’ll spend time getting reacquainted with the older set. Ditto for the closest competition for each new set of headphones that I review. 
Other noise-canceling headphones we tested 
AirPods Max 
Apple’s AirPods Max are premium, well-designed over-ear headphones that incorporate all of the best features you find on standard AirPods: solid noise cancellation, spatial audio and easy Siri access. However, their $550 starting price makes them almost prohibitively expensive, even for Apple users. There are better options available at lower prices, but if you can pick up the AirPods Max at a steep discount, they might be worthwhile for the biggest Apple fans among us. 
Dyson On-Trac 
The On-Trac headphones have an almost infinitely customizable design, and that’s what’s most unique about them. The sound profile offers some nice detail, but lacks dynamic range overall. ANC is average at best and there aren’t any advanced features that will make your life easier. Well, except for the hearing health monitor, which is actually handy. All told, that’s not a lot for a set of $500 headphones. 
Sonos Ace 
The Sonos Ace is an excellent debut for the company’s first headphones. The combination of refined design, great sound quality and home theater tricks creates a unique formula. However, ANC performance is just okay and key functionality is still in the works for many users. 
Sony ULT Wear 
If most headphones don’t have the level of bass you desire, the ULT Wear is an option to consider. The low-end thump isn’t for everyone, but there are also plenty of handy features and a refined look to make the $200 set more compelling than many in this price range. 
Beats Studio Pro 
The Studio Pro lacks basic features like automatic pausing, and multipoint connectivity is only available on Android. Moreover, they’re not very comfortable for people with larger heads. Overall sound quality is improved, though, and voice performance on calls is well above average. 
Master &amp; Dynamic MH40 (2nd gen) 
The MH40 are a great set of headphones if you favor crisp, clear and natural sound that isn’t overly tuned. This pair showcases the company’s affinity for leather and metal too, but limited customization and short battery life for non-ANC cans kept this set from making the cut. 
Bowers &amp; Wilkins Px8 
The company’s trademark pristine sound is on display here, but the Px8 is more expensive and not nearly as comfortable as the Px7 S3. 
Noble Audio FoKus Apollo 
While this is my top pick for overall sound quality in our main guide to the best wireless headphones, the ANC performance is less impressive than the Px7 S3. Bowers &amp; Wilkins gets the nod here for its improved noise cancellation over the Px7 S2 and Px7 S2e, and its overall excellent audio quality. 
Noise-canceling headphones FAQs 
Does noise cancellation block all noise? 
Noise cancellation doesn’t block out all noise, though it does drastically reduce the volume of most external sounds. 
Is there a difference between wired vs wireless noise-canceling headphones? 
In terms of sound quality, if you have two headphones — one wired and one wireless — with similar specs, the difference is going to be very minimal. However, wireless headphones offer more convenience, allowing you to move around more freely with your headphones on, which is why they often feature noise cancellation to minimize external sounds. 
Does noise cancellation impact sound quality? 
ANC does bear some weight on sound quality, but the impact of this often doesn’t outweigh the benefits. Noise cancellation reduces ambient noise, allowing a greater focus on audio detail. For audiophiles, however, there may be a small difference in sound fidelity when ANC is turned on.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-noise-canceling-headphones-130029881.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-10%2F54350070-ab6d-11f0-9fdd-5666e885bfcf&resize=1400%2C840&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=02698fb2c939ba0b47bb9b17e8e3f85bc4025eea,https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-noise-canceling-headphones-130029881.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-11T10:00:35Z,11,Tech

"The best streaming deals: Save on MasterClass, Audible, Philo and others","Streaming services keep raising prices. At this point, if you subscribe to all the major services out there, you&#39;re basically paying the same price as cable — those antiquated local monopolies that streaming was supposed to save us from. But streaming still has one big advantage over the old ways: no contracts. That means you can grab a good streaming deal and then cancel without penalty. 
Our advice is to sign up for a service when you see a good streaming deal (or the latest season of, say, Doctor Who, Severance, Andor and/or The Last of Us). Then, when the deal ends or you&#39;ve binged whatever it is you want to watch, cancel as needed. But streaming deals don&#39;t come around all that often and, when they do, it&#39;s easy to miss them thanks to...everything. So we&#39;re keeping eyes out for the best streaming deals out there and we update this guide often — so check it out the next time you have a hankering to watch something new. 
Best streaming deals 
True streaming deals can be hard to come by. Most often, they’ll pop up during the Black Friday shopping period. On occasion, we’ll see them sparingly throughout the year and they usually take the form of a discounted monthly or annual rate for a limited period of time. Also, true streaming deals are typically on the ad-supported versions of a service, but once in a while you’ll find a unicorn of a deal on a tier that has ad-free viewing. 
If you’re able to wait for a deal before subscribing to a streaming service, we recommend doing so. You’ll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate. 

  
Philo Core — $25 for your first month ($8 off): Our pick for the best cheap live TV streaming service, Philo offers more than 70 channels in its Core tier, plus access to HBO Max (with ads), AMC+ and Discovery+. After your first month, the subscription will auto-renew at the standard $33-per-month rate. 
Audible — three months for $3: For literally $1 per month, you can get access to Audible&#39;s enormous library of published audiobooks, podcasts and Audible Originals (which can be anything from never-before-heard books to live performances). It&#39;s only three months, after which you&#39;ll have to cancel or renew at the regular price, but an audiobibliophile can cram a lot of listening into 90 days. 
Starz (one year) for $12 ($58 off): Pay upfront for one year and you can get more than $40 off a Stars annual subscription. There&#39;s a month-to-month option too, which costs $3 per month for the first three months if you don&#39;t want to commit to the full year. Either option gives you access to the entire Starz TV and movie library with offline viewing and no ads. 
Spotify Premium Individual — four months for free ($48 off): This is our favorite music streaming service for podcasts and social features. The Premium Individual plan lets you listen ad-free and skip songs at will. You can also organize your listening queue and download content for offline listening. Just be aware, your subscription will auto-renew at the end of the trial period. So if you don&#39;t want to be on the hook for the $12 monthly fee, set a reminder to cancel and go back to the free version. 
Amazon Music Unlimited — three months for free ($36 off): Amazon&#39;s own music streaming service is now free for three months, for new subscribers only. With it, you get access to 100 million songs with no ads, many podcasts and some audiobooks from Audible as well. 
Fubo Pro for $55/month for the first month ($30 off): Fubo has introductory discounts on most of its packages, and the Pro package is the least expensive plan currently listed. It offers access to 224 channels, unlimited cloud DVR and up to 10 simultaneous streams. It even includes regional sports content from the NHL, MLB and NBA. 
DirecTV starting at $50/month for one month (up to $40 off): All of DirecTV&#39;s signature packages are up to $45 off right now for your first month when you sign up. If you opt for the base &#34;Entertainment&#34; package, you&#39;ll spend $50 for the first month and get access to over 90 channels, including many local stations as well as ESPN, ESPN 2 and Fox Sports 1. You&#39;ll also be able to watch on the go with the DirecTV mobile app. 
Streaming bundle discounts 
There’s more consolidation happening now than ever before in the streaming space, and that means there are more streaming bundle options. These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you’ll spend less overall by just paying for the single service. 
Speaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on HBO Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option. 
Disney+ 
If you feel like Charlie Kelly trying to figure out who Pepe Silvia is when you look at Disney&#39;s streaming prices chart, you&#39;re not alone. The confusion comes from the fact that Disney owns, or has a hand in, many streaming services including Hulu and ESPN. Throw in a partnership with HBO Max and you have a ton of options to consider and, probably, whiplash to match. Here&#39;s a quick overview of popular Disney+ bundle pricing. 
 
 Disney+ and Hulu bundle (with ads) — $13/month 
 Disney+ and Hulu bundle (without ads) — $20/month 
 Disney+, Hulu and ESPN Select (with ads) — $20/month 
 Disney+, Hulu and ESPN Select (without ads on Disney+ and Hulu only) — $30/month 
 Disney+, Hulu and HBO Max (with ads) — $20/month 
 Disney+, Hulu and HBO Max (without ads) — $33/month 
 
Peacock TV 
Peacock doesn&#39;t have any streaming bundles available all year round, but you can save if you pay for one year upfront. 
 
 Peacock Select (with ads) — $8/month or $80/year 
 Peacock Premium (with ads) — $11/month or $110/year 
 Peacock Premium Plus (without ads) — $17/month or $170/year 
 
Paramount+ 
Paramount+ used to bill its tier with Showtime as a sort of bundle, but it has since renamed its plans and focused the Showtime inclusion in its premium tier as just another bonus of paying for the higher priced plan. 
 
 Paramount+ Essential (with ads) —$8/month or $60/year 
 Paramount Premium (without ads) — $13/month or $120/year 
 
Student discounts on streaming services 
It pays to be a student — sometimes, at least. A number of streaming services have student discounts you can take advantage of as long as you&#39;re actively studying. What that translates to most of the time is being able to verify your student status and signing up with your .edu email address. 
HBO Max student discount — subscribe for $5/month (50 percent off): HBO Max offers their ad-supported tier to students for half off the usual rate. You’ll just have to verify that you’re a student through Unidays, and make note that this offer is only good for up to 12 months of service. 
Hulu student discount — subscribe for $2/month (75 percent off): Those with a valid student ID can get Hulu’s ad-supported tier for 75 percent off the typical rate. They’ll keep the same sale price for as long as they’re a student as well. 
Spotify student discount — Premium + Hulu with ads for $6/month (72 percent off): Spotify’s student offer continues to be one of the best around, giving you access to the Premium tier of the music streamer and Hulu’s ad-supported plan for only $6 monthly. Purchased separately, you’d pay $22 per month for both of the services. Plus, the first month is free when you sign up. 
NBA League Pass student discount — one year for $120 (40 percent off): Students can get one year of League Pass for only $10 per month, which includes access to NBA TV and the ability to watch classic and archive games on-demand. On the NBA League Pass website, look for the student discount banner at the top and follow the instructions to verify your student status.

How to justify your security investments,"
		
					  
						




In modern corporate environments, investments in security technologies are no longer judged solely on technical maturity. Funding increasingly depends on the extent to which they can generate revenue, mitigate risks, and create shareholder value.



As a result, CISOs are expected to present their strategies not as mere technical upgrades, but as enablers of revenue growth. The challenge lies not only in making the right investment decisions, but also in justifying them at the board level.



CISOs often find themselves on the defensive when they present solutions before the challenge has been clearly defined. This approach creates disconnect instead of consensus. Executives want to understand what their organization can achieve with a new solution, which pitfalls can be avoided, and why cybersecurity investments cannot be postponed.



Therefore, when presenting a cybersecurity strategy, for example, zero trust, the focus of communication with the board should be on how the company’s cyber risk profile can be changed for the better.



Linking security technology with strategic priorities



To be credible in the boardroom, CISOs must define their planned expenditures in line with the company’s objectives. The board focuses on priorities such as entering new markets, improving margins, increasing resilience, and ensuring compliance. A well-thought-out proposal directly addresses these concerns.



When a security platform reduces incident response time, the result is operational stability and therefore greater resilience. When it consolidates tools, it ensures cost efficiency. When it enables secure expansion into new regions, revenue growth follows. Such a line of reasoning builds credibility and helps secure investment approvals.



The language of risks and returns



Boards of directors make decisions considering concepts such as risk and return. These include financial risks, operational risks, and reputational risks for the company. Board members assess the probability, exposure, and impact of incidents in each of these areas. Accordingly, the CISO’s role is to clarify how a proposed investment reduces vulnerabilities, limits the impact of incidents, or increases infrastructure resilience.



These discussions should outline cost models, scenarios for potential security breaches, recovery timelines after a cyberattack, and the business benefits. The goal should be to avoid downtime while speaking the language of the board of directors, without compromising technical integrity.



Consider shareholder value



The maturity level and mindsets of boards regarding cybersecurity vary considerably. Some supervisory boards react only after a major cyber incident or a failed audit. Others are much more proactive in their approach and require cybersecurity assessments as part of their market expansion or M&amp;A activities. Still others incorporate cybersecurity into simulations and ask forward-looking questions about resilience in the face of potential attack scenarios.



Understanding this level of maturity helps in adapting the communication strategy. A reactive board may need a clear explanation of the negative consequences. An informed board is more likely to expect quantifiable results and a roadmap. The best board discussions occur when the CISO adapts to the board’s understanding of technology while carefully broadening its perspective.



Positioning operational excellence as an outcome



One of the most effective arguments in discussions with the board regarding cybersecurity is operational excellence. When companies operate in different regions and industries, they must work agilely, securely, and with control. An IT architecture should:




Address global requirements



Support employees who work from anywhere



Integrate third parties



Meet a number of regulatory requirements



Protect intellectual property




Such a comprehensive set of requirements can very quickly lead to complex implementation and, consequently, inefficiencies. CISOs, with a strong technology strategy, focus on a simplified infrastructure, enabling secure global data flows and shortening time to market. This positioning elevates the discussion from system selection to a strategic level.



Focus on future risks



A board of directors is expected to focus not only on current risks but also on future scenarios. These include, for example, regulating the ethical use of AI, understanding the impact of data misuse, and preparing for the effects of quantum computing. The board will be responsible and even held liable for the secure and regulated handling of data. These are no longer abstract issues. Therefore, they should already be on the CISO’s agenda as future technological challenges.



The use of AI has increased in companies, and executives are now responsible for data usage. While quantum computing is still in its early stages, the risks this future technology poses to today’s encryption methods already make it a necessary component of any long-term planning. Many CISOs are already seizing the opportunity to raise the issue with the board and explain what measures will be necessary to protect data in the foreseeable future.



The power of numbers



The financial structure is just as important as the strategic approach. As companies continue to move from hardware-intensive architectures to cloud-native SaaS models, the economics of security are changing. Costs are shifting from capital expenditures to operating expenses. While this may initially lead to a decrease in EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization), it also eliminates hardware replacement cycles, improves forecast accuracy, and reduces long-term total cost of ownership.



Per-user billing models for cloud services ensure predictability and greater flexibility in responding to changes. Further savings potential lies in consolidating tools onto a few platform providers. Additionally, process automation can reduce the burden on the service desk and improve productivity.



Ultimately, CISOs should demonstrate how potential investments in new technologies will improve cash flow, safeguard margins, and scale with business growth. CFOs and audit committees want to know how each proposal will impact financial results. They also want to understand what can be capitalized, what offsetting effects to expect, and how the investments will align with demand.



Conclusion



Ultimately, justifying security investments isn’t about persuasion, but about exerting influence. It’s about aligning business priorities with secure, scalable, and cost-effective solutions.



Accordingly, CISOs must present a strategy that reduces risks, improves agility, and positions the company for long-term success. When IT leadership speaks the language of added value in their solutions, their proposals no longer sound like technical requirements, but like business necessities.

Fortinet admins urged to update software to close FortiCloud SSO holes,"
		
					  
						




Admins using FortiCloud SSO (single sign on) to authenticate access to Fortinet products are urged to upgrade the software running some of the company’s gateway products as soon as possible, or risk their networks being compromised.



“Users of Fortinet appliances should, for now, disable SSO until they are able to patch the devices,” advised Johannes Ullrich, dean of research at the SANS Institute. “However, in the long run, this is not a reason to abandon SSO, and it should be re-enabled after the patch is applied.”



The holes, CVE-2025-59718 and CVE-2025-59719, are cryptographic signature vulnerabilities in the FortiOS operating system that runs Fortinet devices, as well as in the FortiWeb, FortiProxy and FortiSwitchManager products. They allow an unauthenticated attacker to bypass the FortiCloud SSO login authentication via a crafted SAML (security assertion markup language) message, if that feature is enabled on the device. 



In an advisory, Fortinet notes that the FortiCloud SSO login feature is not enabled in default factory configurations. However, when an administrator registers the device with FortiCare product support from the device’s GUI, single sign-on login is enabled unless they turn off the setting “Allow administrative login using FortiCloud SSO” on the registration page.



Single sign-on allows users to enter one password to access many applications or services, and in this case it enables an admin to oversee several Fortinet devices. Ullrich calls it “a crucial component in providing a unified authentication and access control experience across an organization. Integrating devices like FortiNet’s offerings is important, and organizations are typically advised to enable this feature.”



Fortinet uses SAML as the underlying protocol, he explained, noting, “this is a complex protocol, and numerous implementations of it have encountered issues in the past. Just yesterday, the same day Fortinet patched its systems, Ruby released a patch for its SAML library.”



He added that SAML implementations often suffer problems due to the intricacies of XML parsing and ambiguities in interpreting the result.



To prevent being affected by this flaw, Fortinet says admins should turn off the FortiCloud SSO login feature (if enabled) until after upgrading to a non-affected version. To turn off FortiCloud login, it said, go to System -&gt; Settings, then toggle “Allow administrative login using FortiCloud SSO” to Off. Alternatively, admins can use the command line interface and enter:



config system globalset admin-forticloud-sso-login disableend



Affected applications should then be updated to the latest versions, and SSO re-enabled.



Robert Beggs, head of Canadian-based incident response firm DigitalDefence, said that fortunately the vulnerability was identified by FortiGuard’s internal team. “If it had been announced by a third party, then it would have been more likely a vulnerability that was being actively exploited in the wild,” he observed. “It appears that this may have been identified in time to get a warning out and minimize potential compromises.”



The fact that a pair of vulnerabilities affects a number of a manufacturer’s offerings shows the downside of having a shared code base for their products, Beggs added. While on the one hand, it allows the vendor to rapidly scale the number and functionality of products and to ensure integrated operation, on the other hand, the codebase becomes a single point of failure. These FortiGuard issues demonstrate both sides of the coin.



“The vulnerability is critical, and security teams must apply the recommended steps,” he said.



Fortinet was asked for comment, but did not respond by publication time.

Security researchers given new boost,"
		
					  
						




Computer security researchers are in the spotlight as governments look to tackle the growing threat of cybercrime.



Last week, British security minister Dan Jarvis set out a new approach to combatting computer crime, highlighting the damage that security breaches have done to the UK economy and emphasizing the importance of computer security researchers. The next day, the Portuguese parliament passed an act giving more protection to the same group.



In his speech, Jarvis explained how the UK’s 1990 Computer Misuse Act had outlived its usefulness, stating, “it can leave many cyber security experts feeling constrained in the activity that they can undertake. These researchers play an important role in increasing the resilience of UK systems, and securing them from unknown vulnerabilities. We shouldn’t be shutting these people out, we should be welcoming them and their work.”



He went on to say that the government is looking to upgrade current legislation. “We are looking at a legal change to the Computer Misuse Act. This would create a ‘statutory defense’ for these researchers to spot and share vulnerabilities, which would protect them from prosecution, as long as they meet certain safeguards.”



The Portuguese legislation also offers a degree of protection to security researchers, provided that they don’t seek to gain financial advantage and don’t breach data protection laws.



These updated approaches from the UK and Portugal are in line with other countries’ statutory protection for researchers; the Netherlands, France and Belgium have all introduced similar guidelines.



Jarvis’s proposals have been warmly received by the security industry. Charlotte Wilson, head of enterprise business, UK and Ireland at Check Point Software, said that the Computer Misuse Act was outdated and not fit for purpose. “As it stands, it treats security researchers in much the same way as cybercriminals, even when they are acting in good faith to strengthen defenses rather than undermine them,” she pointed out.



But, she added, “the solution is relatively simple: create a legal safe space that allows researchers to test systems and report vulnerabilities responsibly, without fear of prosecution. Portugal has recently taken this important step by introducing clear rules for good-faith testing and a framework for responsible disclosure. It’s a pragmatic model that recognizes the essential role researchers play in identifying and fixing security weaknesses and something the UK should seriously consider adopting.”



Wilson stressed, however, that organizations should not be entirely dependent on government action; businesses could also take steps to help researchers. “They should publish a clear vulnerability disclosure policy that outlines how researchers can safely report issues; respond swiftly to vulnerabilities and define boundaries by being transparent about what testing is permitted, how to report findings, and what the process entails.”



Her views were echoed by Dray Agha, senior manager of security operations at Huntress. “Organizations can support the process by rewarding responsible disclosure, avoiding knee-jerk legal threats, participating in community initiatives, and advocating for reforms that strike the right balance between preventing abuse and enabling legitimate research,” he said.



He added that the government should ensure that researchers are fully protected, calling for an independent oversight body to validate and support responsible research. “This could provide rapid advisory opinions, mediate disclosure disputes, and issue assurance letters so researchers are not left exposed when organizations are slow or uncooperative.”



And, he noted, companies are often slow to disclose security breaches, something which needs to change. “User organizations should be legally obliged to maintain a disclosure channel, acknowledge reports promptly, and work within a set remediation window. This lifts the burden from researchers and reduces the grey zone where they feel legally at risk,” he said.



This will be music to the ears of Dan Jarvis, who, in his speech, stressed the need for co-operation. “This work is not the responsibility of the government alone,” he said. “We need a whole of society approach. We can only create a proper deterrence through partnership, which is why the government and business are working together to improve our security. For too long, businesses and politicians have been under the misapprehension that cyber investment is a drag on growth. But this is a mistake. Cyber security keeps us safe – and is a key enabler of growth.”



Jarvis’s speech is only a precursor to any legislation, but it is clear that the UK is set to go down the path that other countries have taken, finally giving security researchers their day in the sun.

Hidden .NET HTTP proxy behavior can open RCE flaws in apps — a security issue Microsoft won’t fix,"
		
					  
						




Researchers uncovered an unexpected behavior of HTTP client proxies when created in .NET code, potentially allowing attackers to write malicious code to arbitrary files. This in turn can open remote code execution (RCE) attack paths through web shells and malicious PowerShell scripts in many .NET applications, including commercial products.



Microsoft does not plan to fix this issue in the .NET Framework itself, saying that application developers are responsible for not passing untrusted and user-controlled URLs to the code classes that initialize HTTP client proxies.



“The impact depends on how each application uses the proxy classes, but in practice we achieved RCE in almost every product we investigated,” Piotr Bazydło, a researcher with security firm watchTowr said in a report. Bazydło also authored a technical whitepaper that he presented Wednesday at the Black Hat Europe conference.



By taking advantage of this unexpected .NET behavior, the researcher found RCE issues in Barracuda Service Center, Ivanti Endpoint Manager, Umbraco 8 CMS, Microsoft PowerShell, and Microsoft SQL Server Integration Services. However, he believes many more products and private enterprise apps are likely vulnerable.



“The most powerful exploitation path arises when applications generate HTTP client proxies from attacker-supplied WSDL files using the ServiceDescriptionImporter class,” he said. “That mechanism alone enabled successful exploitation in products from Barracuda, Ivanti, Microsoft and Umbraco, and it took only a few days of review to find working cases.”



HTTP client proxies can handle non-HTTP protocols



The .NET Framework and ASP.NET are among the most popular programming languages for enterprise applications. When a developer wants their application to communicate with an XML Web Service over HTTP they must create a proxy class that is derived from the built-in HttpWebClientProtocol class.



The Framework also provides three proxy classes — SoapHttpClientProtocol, HttpGetClientProtocol, and HttpPostClientProtocol — that enable support for SOAP, HTTP-GET, and HTTP-POST, respectively. The SoapHttpClientProtocol, which allows SOAP requests to be performed inside .NET applications, is particularly popular, because SOAP is a widely used protocol for exchanging XML-formatted messages between web services over HTTP.



Therein lies the core of the issue: As the names of these classes — and their official documentation — imply, they are meant to be used for HTTP communication. However, what Bazydło found is that passing URLs with the file:// scheme to these proxy classes will result in the FileWebRequest handler being called instead of HttpWebRequest.



“Wait, what? Why does a SOAP proxy need to be able to ‘send’ SOAP requests to a local file?” he said. “Nobody on this planet expects to receive a valid SOAP response from the filesystem.”



Because there is no mention in the documentation that these classes also work with the FILE or FTP protocol schemes, and there’s no reasonable expectation that they would, many developers are likely not aware of this behavior and have not taken additional steps to prevent this.



A path to exploitation



While this strange behavior enables exploitation, it does not guarantee it. First, an attacker would need to be able to control the URL passed to one of these classes in the application code. Although Microsoft seems to suggest this should not happen, in practice plenty of application developers expose SOAP API endpoints in their applications, sometimes without authentication.



One example found by Bazydło was in Barracuda Service Center, a popular enterprise Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) platform. The issue, now tracked as CVE-2025-34392, was patched in hotfix 2025.1.1.



By being able to pass an arbitrary URL to a SOAP API endpoint in an affected .NET application, an attacker can trigger a leak of NTLM challenge. For example, a file:// URL pointing to a remote attacker-controlled SMB server will cause the system to send its NTLM credentials in encrypted form to that server. The attacker can then either attempt to crack them or use them in an NTLM relay attack.



To cause a more powerful local arbitrary file write, however, the attacker needs to be able to also control the arguments sent to the SOAP method, which will mean arbitrary strings can be inserted inside the XML output written to the controlled path on disk. Controlling this will often be enough to write a web shell in CSHTML (server-side templates) format on the server hosting the vulnerable app.



But it doesn’t stop here. Another way to exploit this is through Web Services Description Language (WSDL) imports. WSDL is an XML-based language web services use to provide information about their features and available interfaces. A service can provide a WSDL file to a client application, which then parses it to automatically build valid SOAP requests to the service.



Generating client SOAP proxies from WSDL imports is a fairly common functionality in .NET applications, and this is achieved by parsing WSDL files using the ServiceDescriptionImporter class. As Bazydło found, ServiceDescriptionImporter does not validate that the service definition in the WSDL file is HTTP or HTTPS.



“To summarize, WSDL imports create a very powerful exploitation path for the invalid cast issue in HttpWebClientProtocol,” he said. “If an attacker controls the imported WSDL, they also control: The target URL, which allows the proxy to interact with the filesystem; the SOAP method names; the names and types of method arguments.”



This was the case for the Barracuda Service Center vulnerability, but also for Umbraco 8 CMS — one of the most popular content management systems written in .NET — and Ivanti EPM. Umbraco 8 reached end-of-life in February so no longer receives security patches.



“At a high level, the story is simple,” the watchTowr researcher said. “The .NET Framework allows its HTTP client proxies to be tricked into interacting with the filesystem. With the right conditions, they will happily write SOAP requests into local paths instead of sending them over HTTP. In the best case, this results in NTLM relaying or challenge capture. In the worst case, it becomes remote code execution through webshell uploads or PowerShell script drops.”

"Mewgenics, the next game from The Binding of Isaac's developer, will arrive next February on PC","Indie game developer Edmund McMillen hosted a Reddit AMA today offering some more details about his upcoming game Mewgenics. For starters, the Steam release date for this turn-based cat-breeding RPG has been slightly delayed to February 10. The game was first announced all the way back in 2012 and had most recently been slated for a launch some time this year. Part of the long development cycle was so that McMillen could pause to launch Super Meat Boy Forever, the sequel to his Super Meat Boy platforming hit from 2010. Gamers may also know McMillen for The Binding of Isaac, which has had some notable crossovers with titles like Balatro in recent years.   Other tidbits from the AMA include the promise that McMillen already has DLC ideas, so expect to have additional content release after the base game is available. Although there doesn&#39;t seem to be any lack of replayability in Mewgenics; McMillen said &#34;I currently have 300+ hours across 2 saves and have only beaten the game on one save so far.&#34; There is also a plan to have some console versions of the game, although likely not until much later next year at the soonest, the dev added.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/mewgenics-the-next-game-from-the-binding-of-isaacs-developer-will-arrive-next-february-on-pc-235740063.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2FMewgenics.jpg&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=3478680634882b9af14a846f1caa0e3b633bde78,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/mewgenics-the-next-game-from-the-binding-of-isaacs-developer-will-arrive-next-february-on-pc-235740063.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-10T23:57:40Z,7,Tech

In October 2025, the company was impacted by the same Amazon Web Services outage that took down services like Alexa, Fortnite and Snapchat for hours.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/apple-tv-and-apple-music-are-down-for-some-users-214425626.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-11%2F4711d780-b971-11f0-abff-c74da00bd128&resize=1400%2C821&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=9bbd81ed94e7c5d76b3fcedc2bb7cbeaf0b929b5,https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/apple-tv-and-apple-music-are-down-for-some-users-214425626.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-10T21:59:35Z,11,Tech
Meta is reportedly working on a new AI model called 'Avocado' and it might not be open source,"Mark Zuckerberg has for months publicly hinted that he is backing away from open-source AI models. Now, Meta&#39;s latest AI pivot is starting to come into focus. The company is reportedly working on a new model, known inside of Meta as &#34;Avocado,&#34; which could mark a major shift away from its previous open-source approach to AI development. Both CNBC and Bloomberg have reported on Meta&#39;s plans surrounding &#34;Avocado,&#34; with both outlets saying the model &#34;could&#34; be proprietary rather than open-source. Avocado, which is due out sometime in 2026, is being worked on inside of &#34;TBD,&#34; a smaller group within Meta&#39;s AI Superintelligence Labs that&#39;s headed up by  Chief AI Officer Alexandr Wang, who apparently favors closed models.It&#39;s not clear what Avocado could mean for Llama. Earlier this year, Zuckerberg said he expected Meta would &#34;continue to be a leader&#34; in open source but that it wouldn&#39;t &#34;open source everything that we do.&#34; He&#39;s also cited safety concerns as they relate to superintelligence. As both CNBC and Bloomberg note, Meta&#39;s shift has also been driven by issues surrounding the release of Llama 4. The Llama 4 &#34;Behemoth&#34; model has been delayed for months; The New York Times reported earlier this year that Wang and other execs had &#34;discussed abandoning&#34; it altogether. And developers have reportedly been unimpressed with the Llama 4 models that are available. There have been other shakeups within the ranks of Meta&#39;s AI groups as Zuckerberg has spent billions of dollars building a team dedicated to superintelligence. The company laid off several hundred workers from its Fundamental Artificial Intelligence Research (FAIR) unit. And Meta veteran and Chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun, who has been a proponent for open-source and skeptical of LLMs, recently announced he was leaving the company. That Meta may now be pursuing a closed AI model is a significant shift for Zuckerberg, who just last year said &#34;fuck that&#34; about closed platforms and penned a lengthy memo titled &#34;Open Source AI is the Path Forward.&#34; But the notoriously competitive CEO is also apparently intensely worried about falling behind OpenAI, Google and other rivals. Meta has said it expects to spend $600 billion over the next few years to fund its AI ambitions.

Spotify's new playlist feature gives users more control over their recommendation algorithm,"Spotify is attempting to give users more control over the music the streaming service recommends with a new playlist feature called &#34;Prompted Playlist.&#34; The beta feature is rolling out in New Zealand starting on December 11, and will let users write a custom prompt that Spotify can use — alongside their listening history — to create a playlist of new music.By tapping on Prompted Playlist, Spotify subscribers participating in the beta will be presented with a prompt field where they can type exactly what they want to hear and how they want Spotify&#39;s algorithm to respond. And while past AI features took users&#39; individual taste into consideration, Spotify claims Prompted Playlist &#34;taps into your entire Spotify listening history, all the way back to day one.&#34; Prompted Playlist will exist alongside Spotify&#39;s other playlist features.SpotifyPrompts can be as broad or specific as users want, and Spotify says playlists can also be set to automatically update with new songs on a specific cadence. An &#34;Ideas&#34; tab in the Prompted Playlist setup screen can provide suggestions for users who need inspiration for their prompt. And interestingly, Spotify says each song in the playlist will be presented with a short description explaining why the algorithm chose it, which could help direct future fine-tuning.If this all sounds familiar, it&#39;s because Spotify has already tried AI-generated playlists in the past. The difference here, besides Spotify framing the new feature as giving users more &#34;control,&#34; is the detail of the prompts, the depth of user data Spotify is applying and the options users will have to keep playlists up-to-date. Prompted Playlist is only available in English for now, but Spotify says the feature will evolve as it adds more users.Spotify isn&#39;t the first company to offer users more direct control over how content is recommended to them. Meta has recently started experimenting with algorithm-tuning options in Threads and Instagram, and TikTok lets users completely reset their For You page to start fresh. The irony of all these features is that algorithm-driven feeds were supposed to be able to recommend good music, posts and videos without additional prompting. Now that prompting is being pitched as a feature, rather than extra work.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/spotifys-new-playlist-feature-gives-users-more-control-over-their-recommendation-algorithm-203237903.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2FSpotify-Prompted-Playlist.jpg&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=40ad4714aad88e1283a54e06a115cf4b4af2a055,https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/spotifys-new-playlist-feature-gives-users-more-control-over-their-recommendation-algorithm-203237903.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-10T20:32:37Z,8,Tech

Intel loses its latest challenge to 16-year-old EU antitrust case,"Intel will have to pay up in an antitrust case dating back to 2009, Reuters reported on Wednesday. The company has lost its challenge against a €376 million ($438.7 million) regulatory fine levied by the European Commission. However, Intel managed to get the amount reduced to 237 million euros ($276.6 million).The case began in 2009, when mobile computing was in its infancy and netbooks (remember those?) were all the rage in the PC space. At the time, the EU ruled that Intel violated antitrust laws on multiple fronts. First, it used illegal hidden rebates to push rivals out of the PC processor market. Second, it paid manufacturers to delay or stop production of AMD-powered products.The latter, the portion that today&#39;s fine deals with, was classified as &#34;naked restrictions.&#34; It regarded anticompetitive payments Intel made to HP, Acer and Lenovo between 2002 and 2006.As often happens in these situations, the legal process bounced back and forth through the courts for years. In 2017, Europe&#39;s highest court ordered the case to be re-examined, citing a lack of proper economic assessment of how Intel&#39;s behavior affected its rivals. Europe&#39;s second-highest court then overturned the judgment from the first (hidden rebates) portion of the fine in 2022, a move confirmed by the EU Court of Justice last year. That penalty, initially set at a whopping €1.06 billion ($1.2 billion), was wiped off the books.The second (&#34;naked restrictions&#34;) fine was imposed in 2023 after European courts upheld that portion. Intel&#39;s latest challenge sought to have that one removed, too. Instead, it will have to settle for shaving one-third off the initial sum.With today’s judgment, it&#39;s tempting to declare the matter over and done with. But the Commission and Intel can still appeal the decision to the EU Court of Justice on points of law. Tune in next year to see if this long, strange saga has another chapter.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/intel-loses-its-latest-challenge-to-16-year-old-eu-antitrust-case-200746004.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F5fefba40-cfb2-11f0-bee5-0b03f2ee8bdf&resize=1400%2C931&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=a2301ad8ad4c6dadbd5bbe05a437633fa4e12cd7,https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/intel-loses-its-latest-challenge-to-16-year-old-eu-antitrust-case-200746004.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-10T20:07:46Z,7,Tech

The 10 best white elephant gifts worth fighting over for 2025,"There are a lot of competing ideas as to what a white elephant gift exchange really is. The origins of the term “white elephant” point to one definition: According to legend, the King of Siam would give a white elephant to courtiers who had upset them. It was a far more devious punishment than simply having them executed. The recipient had no choice but to simply thank the king for such an opulent gift, knowing that they likely could not afford the upkeep for such an animal. It would inevitably lead them to financial ruin.While that story is almost certainly untrue, it can inform one approach to the white elephant gift exchange: gifting something just useful or amusing enough that it won’t immediately get tossed into the trash, but is also somewhat of a burden. However, every workplace, friend group and family unit has their own approach to white elephant gift exchanges nowadays. Some compete to get a gift that others will surely want to steal, while others scavenge for the most niche and targeted gag gifts. Almost all of them, though, typically have a price limit that keeps the burden of gift giving to a minimum — usually $50 or less. So with all of that in mind, here are some white elephant gift ideas that will get you a few chuckles without requiring you to spend too much (or think too hard about it).

White elephant FAQs 
What is white elephant? 
A white elephant gift exchange is a party game typically played around the holidays in which people exchange funny, impractical gifts. 
How does white elephant work? 
A group of people each bring one wrapped gift to the white elephant gift exchange, and each gift is typically of a similar value. All gifts are then placed together and the group decides the order in which they will each claim a gift. The first person picks a white elephant gift from the pile, unwraps it and their turn ends. The following players can either decide to unwrap another gift and claim it as their own, or steal a gift from someone who has already taken a turn. The rules can vary from there, including the guidelines around how often a single item can be stolen — some say twice, max. The game ends when every person has a white elephant gift. 
Why is it called white elephant? 
The term “white elephant” is said to come from the legend of the King of Siam gifting white elephants to courtiers who upset him. While it seems like a lavish gift on its face, the belief is that the courtiers would be ruined by the animal’s upkeep costs.

The world premieres and other hotness from The Game Awards 2025 Day of the Devs stream,"You gotta love that post-Day of the Devs showcase feeling. The organization, founded by Double Fine Productions and iam8bit, consistently highlights top-tier games from independent developers across the globe, providing space for creators to share their stories in both online and in-person events. This year’s Day of the Devs: The Game Awards Digital Showcase was an hour-long celebration of 22 upcoming indie games, including six world premieres and three release date announcements.Settle in and bask in the afterglow with us:World PremieresVirtue and a Sledgehammer - DeconstructeamDeconstructeam is a small Spanish studio that’s responsible for some of the most cerebral, sexy and darkly philosophical games around, including Gods Will Be Watching, The Red Strings Club and The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood. The team’s next project is Virtue and a Sledgehammer, and it represents a new look with 3D, cel-shaded animations and a third-person perspective rather than the studio’s typical pixelated planar fare. The vibes are just as sinister and introspective as expected, though.Virtue and a Sledgehammer is a moody coming-of-age experience set in a wooded ghost town dotted with robots and lost locals. Spend quiet moments with old friends and then swing the sledgehammer to raze your hometown and uncover memories that can help you move on. The game’s buildings and objects are highly reactive, which can only help with the catharsis of it all.Virtue and a Sledgehammer is due to hit Steam in 2026, published by Devolver Digital.UN:Me - Shueisha GamesNow, this is a horror game. UN:Me comes from Japanese publisher Shueisha Games and developer Historia, and it’s a creepy, mind-bending exploration of primal fear. It stars a young woman with four souls trapped inside of her body, fighting for control of her consciousness. She wanders sterile, illogical hallways and encounters grotesque horrors representing common human fears like heights, authority figures and confined spaces. The souls switch randomly, each one manifesting a specific anxiety. As she wanders, the player has to choose souls to eliminate until only one remains. Whether it’s her real soul or a fake isn’t disclosed until the very end.UN:Me is available to wishlist now on Steam.Scramble Knights Royale - Funktronic LabsFunktronic Labs is mainly known as a VR studio, with games like Cosmic Trip, Fujii and The Light Brigade under its belt, but its latest project doesn’t require a headset at all. Scramble Knights Royale is coming to PC and Xbox in 2026, and it’s a battle royale with adventure game twists. You begin on a boat with 30 to 40 other online players, make your way to land on the back of a turtle, and then it’s essentially Naked and Afraid from there. Find resources, fight creatures, upgrade your gear and play your own game, only battling other players when you encounter them in the wild.Don’t let the sweet, clay-like animations fool you, either — Funktronic says the combat mechanics are incredibly deep and finely honed. Scramble Knights Royale also supports local split-screen. Mirria - MografiMografi made a name for itself with the adorable Jenny LeClue detective game, but now it’s time for something different. Mirria is an atmospheric puzzle experience from ISLANDS: Non-Places artist Carl Burton, published by Mografi, and it looks like a delicious mix of Kentucky Route Zero and Monument Valley. In Mirria, you explore mirror worlds and attempt to make the two realities match, paying attention to small details and making minute adjustments until the unsettling environments are perfect reflections. It looks and sounds like soul-soothing stuff.Mirria is due out in 2026 on Steam.CorgiSpace - FinjiIn recent years, Finji founder Adam Saltsman has been involved in high-profile indie games like Overlands, Night in the Woods, Tunic and Usual June, but his new project taps into his simplistic and mechanics-driven Canabalt roots. Corgispace is a collection of 8-bit games with off-kilter premises, including the soulslike Rat Dreams where you can only dodgeroll, the no-jumping platformer Skeleton Jeleton, and Prince of Prussia, an adventure where you stab Nazis “but in a fun new way,” according to Saltsman. Also, he says there are no secrets in this game, which leads us to believe there is at least one secret in this game.Corgispace is out now (!) on Steam and Itch.io.Frog Sqwad - Panic StationsIf the former Fall Guys developers at Panic Stations know how to do one thing, it’s make a silly-physics multiplayer game, so that’s exactly what they’re doing. Frog Sqwad is a co-op experience where you and your fellow frogs search the sewers for food in order to satiate the swamp king. You can eat food to grow bigger and become the mega frog, vomit to shrink, and use your long sticky tongue to swing, hang and slingshot your friends.

PS Plus Game Catalog additions for December include Assassin's Creed Mirage,"Sony just announced December&#39;s Game Catalog additions for PS Plus subscribers and it&#39;s a pretty decent lineup. All of these titles will be ready to play on December 16, except Skate Story which is already available.

Speaking of Skate Story, it&#39;s a really weird skateboarding sim that&#39;s set in a glass-covered world. The reviews have been positive, with many people praising the outlandish story, surreal locations and the satisfying trick mechanics. It&#39;s made by Sam Eng, who was behind the indie shooter Zarvot. This new game is only available for PS5 subscribers.

Assassin&#39;s Creed Mirage will be available for both PS4 and PS5 players. This is the mainline entry from 2023 and it&#39;s actually really fun. It boasts a &#34;back to basics&#34; design that old-school fans of the franchise should appreciate.

Granblue Fantasy: Relink is a 3D action RPG that started its life as a mobile game. However, this particular RPG features music compositions from Nobuo Uematsu and art direction from Hideo Minaba. Both worked together on some games in a mom-and-pop franchise called Final Fantasy. This console port will be playable on PS4 and PS5
Cat Quest III is a simple action RPG starring, well, cats (and dogs.) This one brings open world tomfoolery to a land teeming with islands, so expect plenty of pirate puns. I enjoyed the first two, as the gameplay loop is pretty addictive and the quests are fun. It&#39;ll be available on PS4 and PS5.
Other forthcoming games include Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, Lego Horizon Adventures, Paw Patrol: Grand Prix and Planet Coaster 2. Sony is also offering a holiday promotion in which new annual PS Plus subscribers receive download credits for movies.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/ps-plus-game-catalog-additions-for-december-include-assassins-creed-mirage-193731745.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2Fe91f8c90-d5f8-11f0-bf5f-9dc8a5575d1c&resize=1400%2C786&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=66fce533e103287a2bb77b0d30eebb3cf1b7d3b3,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/ps-plus-game-catalog-additions-for-december-include-assassins-creed-mirage-193731745.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-10T19:37:31Z,8,Tech

12 steps you can take right now to be safer online,"There&#39;s a fundamental question you can ask of both the internet and real life: &#34;How do I enjoy my time here without taking unnecessary risks?&#34; In grass-touching meatspace, you can cut out processed foods, carry pepper spray and avoid skydiving without a partner.
But the best methods for staying safe online aren&#39;t as intuitive. The internet is a massive town square where people are constantly bellowing deeply personal facts about themselves. It&#39;s no surprise that it&#39;s become a breeding ground for scams, theft and other criminal activity.
Given the breadth of dangers, it may feel easier to throw up your hands and say that whatever happens will happen. I&#39;m here to tell you, though, that cybersecurity doesn&#39;t have to be complex, difficult or time-consuming. You don&#39;t need to be a hacker to foil a hacker — you only have to take advantage of simple tips and free apps designed to make you safer online. Whether you commit to all 12 detailed here or only focus on one, you&#39;ll be much more secure for it.
1. Install security updates immediately
One of the most important things you can do to ensure your digital security is to install all software updates as soon as they become available on your devices. When you see the notification, don&#39;t wait — train yourself to download the update immediately.
Not all software updates are about security, but the ones that are form your best line of defense against technical hacks. When developers discover a flaw that can be exploited, they ship an update to fix it. By the time the flaw gets patched, chances are very high that hackers also know about it, so any time lost means you could be the next to get exploited.
As you go down this list, you&#39;ll learn that cybersecurity threats are less technical than you think. To counter the ones that are, however, there&#39;s nothing more important you can do than install security updates.
2. Use strong passwords
Weak, easily guessed passwords are one of the most frequent causes of data breaches and malware attacks. If a password is one of the ten or so most common, an attacker may be able to guess it with no other information. If it&#39;s connected to you — your birthday, say, or mother&#39;s maiden name — it may be guessable from information anyone can look up online.
Even if your password is a random string of characters, it might still be guessable if it&#39;s too short. Hackers can use programs to guess all possible combinations and try each one on a target account. The longer a password is, the more exponentially difficult it is to guess.

That means you need passwords that are both long and meaningless to you. You might rightly complain that these are bastards to remember, but you&#39;re in luck: password managers can do that for you. A password manager app or browser extension can create passwords when you need them, store them securely and fill them in automatically. All you have to remember is the one master password that unlocks all the others.
3. Set up two-factor authentication
Even the strongest password might get revealed through no fault of your own, like if it&#39;s stored without encryption and leaked in a data breach. That&#39;s why it helps to have two-factor authentication (2FA), also known as multi-factor authentication (MFA), as a second secure layer on every account.
You probably already know 2FA as the irritating extra step that makes you go get your phone — but that&#39;s not the only way to do it. Many apps, including Google and Apple, now let you log in through passkeys. These not only don&#39;t require you to enter a code or password, but use asymmetric encryption, sharing credentials between your device and the service that runs the passkeys. It&#39;s a lot quicker for you, and leaves nothing to steal.
4. Back everything up
Ransomware and its cousins are a growth industry within the cybercrime economy. These attacks corrupt your files or lock you out of them until you pay a fee to get them back. The easiest way to foil a ransomware attack, or to clear any other kind of malware off a device, is to restore the entire system from the most recent backup.
To make sure you actually have a backup, experts recommend the 3-2-1 rule: three different backups, on two different types of storage, with at least one physically distant from the main system. For example, you could have one backup on another device in your house, one in the cloud and one on a portable hard drive. Automatic backup services can save disk images for you at set intervals so you don&#39;t have to remember to do it yourself.
5. Learn to spot social engineering
Despite all the technobabble flying around the cybersecurity world, a great many scams and hacks are accomplished through methods a 19th-century con artist would recognize. Scammers pose as experts or authority figures to gain your trust, and use frightening language to bypass your critical thinking. Ticking clocks, emotional manipulation and fake identities are all in the toolbox.

Take phishing, in which hackers trick you into giving up your information willingly. A typical phishing email might pose as a bank, credit bureau or other authoritative service. In red letters, it may demand your bank password or social security number to immediately fix an irregularity with your account. Other common approaches include warning you about speeding tickets you never incurred or sending receipts for subscriptions you never bought.
Social engineering attacks are constantly evolving, but they often fall back on the same strategies. The best way to foil them is to take a deep breath every time you receive a frightening email or text message, then research it in detail: look up the email address, check the visual design to make sure the sender is who they claim to be, and ask yourself if there&#39;s any way the message could be true. I highly recommend working through this phishing quiz — it&#39;s tough, but fair, and extremely educational.
6. Always check links before clicking
This is a companion to the previous tip. Social engineering scams don&#39;t always try to get you to give up information yourself. They also get you to click on links that put secret malware on your device — like keyloggers that watch you type your passwords or ransomware programs that corrupt your files.
If you&#39;re ever not sure about an email attachment or a link you&#39;re being asked to click, copy the link (without opening it) and paste it into a URL checker like this one from NordVPN. These free tools can tell you if a link is associated with any known malware domains.
Sam Chapman for Engadget
You can also mouse over any link, then look at the bottom-left of your browser to see what URL it will take you to. If an email is from your bank, any links within it should go to your bank&#39;s website. If it&#39;s going anywhere else, especially to an unidentifiable string of characters, be suspicious.
A related tip is to never copy and paste something into your URL bar if you aren&#39;t absolutely sure of what it will do. Social engineering doesn&#39;t always get you to click the link — sometimes attackers leave it un-hyperlinked so mousing over it doesn&#39;t reveal anything. This also goes for the command modules on desktop and laptop computers. In a recent documented attack, hackers convinced AI chatbots to suggest a command that gave them root access to the victim&#39;s device. Never copy-paste anything into the command window without verifying it first, especially if an AI told you to do it.
7. Don&#39;t overshare
Over the last two decades, lots of us have gotten into the habit of dumping all sorts of personal information on social media. This trend has supercharged the scam economy. It may seem harmless to broadcast the names of your kids or the dates you&#39;ll be on vacation, but every piece of data you put into the world makes it easier for a stranger to get hooks into you.
For example, &#34;grandparent scams&#34; are on the rise right now. Grifters contact a target, usually a senior, pretending to be their grandchild. They&#39;ll claim to be in a crisis and need money fast. The more information they have on their target, the more convincing their tale of woe will be. Social media is a prime place to study a potential victim.
Oversharing can also be a compounding problem. If you use weak passwords, your public information can be used to guess your credentials or answer your security questions. So, if you don&#39;t have a password manager yet, think twice before you engage with that quiz post on Facebook that asks for the name of your childhood pet.
8. Use a VPN
I&#39;m a big booster of virtual private networks (VPNs), but it&#39;s important to be realistic about what they can and can&#39;t do. Even the best VPNs aren&#39;t total cybersecurity solutions — you can&#39;t just set one and assume you&#39;re safe forever. A VPN can&#39;t protect you if you use easily guessed passwords, for example, or click on a malware link. It&#39;s about hiding your identity, not making you invulnerable.
So what can a VPN do? In short, it replaces your IP address (a fingerprint that identifies you online) with another IP address, belonging to a server owned by the VPN. The VPN server does business with the internet on your behalf, while its conversations with your device are encrypted so it can&#39;t be traced back to you.
Sam Chapman for Engadget
This means no third party can connect your online actions with your real-world identity. Nobody will be harvesting data on the websites you visit to sell to advertisers, nor building a file on you that an unscrupulous government might misuse. VPNs also protect you from fake public Wi-Fi networks set up by cybercriminals — even if a hacker tricks you with a man-in-the-middle attack, they can&#39;t do much without your real IP address.
Many top VPNs, including my top pick Proton VPN, include ad blockers that can also keep cookies and tracking pixels from latching onto you. So, even if a VPN can&#39;t do everything, you&#39;ll be far safer and more private with one than without one. If you don’t want to pay for a new subscription right now, I&#39;ve also compiled a list of the best free VPNs that are actually safe to use.
9. Run regular virus scans
The most important time to look for malware is when you&#39;re downloading a file from the internet. Not only can unwanted apps hitch rides on seemingly safe files, but links can start downloads in secret, even if you don&#39;t think they&#39;re meant to be downloading anything. A solid antivirus program can catch malware as it arrives on your system, and if it&#39;s uncertain, can lock suspicious files in quarantine until it knows whether they&#39;re safe or not.
Dedicated antivirus apps are sometimes even capable of catching malware that hasn&#39;t been seen or used yet. AV software uses machine learning to identify the common patterns of malware, filtering out new viruses that behave like old ones.
But what about malware that&#39;s already gotten through the perimeter? An antivirus app can also check your computer at set intervals in search of unwanted apps, including those that might be masquerading as system files. Windows computers now come pre-installed with Windows Defender, which is enough to handle most of these tasks, but I recommend at least one anti-malware program on any device.
10. Use email maskers and private search engines
If you&#39;re concerned about your information being misused or mishandled, remember that the less you put out into the world, the less danger you&#39;re in. Keeping your private data off social media is one important step, but there are other ways your data gets disseminated — and other options for responding.
For example, you often need an email address to sign up for an online account. If you use your real email, your contact information is now floating around online, increasing the chance of someone using it to scam you (or at least adding you to mailing lists you never signed up for). To stay safe, use an email masker. These services give you a fake email address you can use to create accounts, which automatically forwards messages to your real address.
Sam Chapman for Engadget
Search engines, especially Google, are also notorious for building profiles on users by watching the terms they search for. You can dodge that by switching to a private search engine like DuckDuckGo, which doesn&#39;t track anything you do — it&#39;s funded by non-targeted ad sales on its search results pages, not by selling your data to brokers.
11. Use a data removal service
Speaking of data brokers: unfortunately, if you&#39;ve been on the internet at any point in the last 10 years without taking intense precautions, your data is probably in the hands of at least one business that makes money by hoarding and selling it. These data brokers range from public-facing, people-search sites to private backend dealers.
Data brokers are poorly regulated and lax about safety. The longer one has your personal information, the more likely it is to leak. The good news is that most brokers (though not all of them) are legally required to delete your data if you ask them to.
However, there are a lot of data brokers out there, and they really want to keep your data. Each one makes opting out harder than uninstalling a Norton product — and hundreds of them may have files on you. To make the process easier, you can use a data removal service like DeleteMe or Surfshark VPN&#39;s partner service Incogni.
12. Practice physical security
Let&#39;s close out the list by getting a little old school. I&#39;ve already discussed how many online scams depend on classic con artistry to work. By the same token, physical infiltration and smash-and-grab tactics still pose a threat to cybersecurity.
It doesn&#39;t take too much imagination to see how this could work. If you leave your laptop or phone unattended in public, for example, someone might insert a flash drive that loads malware onto the system. In one illustrative case, a thief in the Minneapolis area would loiter in bars, watch people unlock their phones, then steal those phones and unlock them himself.
I&#39;m not saying you need to be paranoid every second you&#39;re in public. Just use the same level of caution you&#39;d use to protect your car. Lock your phone with a biometric key so only you can open it, and make sure not to leave any device lying around if it can access your online accounts. And at work, be careful not to let anyone into a secure area if they don&#39;t have the proper credentials.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/12-steps-you-can-take-right-now-to-be-safer-online-130008335.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-07%2F13b86a10-6e4f-11f0-af79-3c5dc90e43f0&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=8041c5fb59dbaf34a62a743cd95c89bc9f5a2ed1,https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/12-steps-you-can-take-right-now-to-be-safer-online-130008335.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-10T19:08:43Z,16,Tech

Marco Rubio bans Calibri font at State Department for being too DEI,"Calibri, which could make documents easier to read for the vision impaired, was apparently installed in 2023 by the department’s then-DEI office.",,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/10/marco-rubio-bans-calibri-font-at-state-department-for-being-too-dei/,https://techcrunch.com/feed/,2025-12-10T19:05:02Z,6,Tech
State Department: Calibri font was a DEI hire,"The US Department of State is unwinding a 2023 decision to use san-serif Calibri font on all official communications and switching to Times New Roman instead, The New York Times reports. In a memo obtained by NYT titled &#34;Return to Tradition: Times New Roman 14-Point Font Required for All Department Paper,&#34; Secretary of State Marco Rubio frames the change as a way to return professionalism to the State Department.&#34;Switching to Calibri achieved nothing except the degradation of the department’s official correspondence,&#34; Rubio said in the memo. That&#39;s because the font is &#34;informal&#34; and clashes with the State Department&#39;s letterhead, according to Rubio, while serif fonts like Times New Roman &#34;connote tradition, formality and ceremony.&#34;Former Secretary of State Antony Blinken originally switched the State Department to Calibri in 2023 to improve the accessibility of official communications. The curvy, flourish-free lines of sans-serif fonts work better with assistive technologies like screen readers and text-to-speech tools. Serif fonts, meanwhile, are typically used in things like newspapers to make small, printed text legible.While Rubio notes that Calibri &#34;was not among the department’s most illegal, immoral, radical or wasteful instances of D.E.I.A.,&#34; it seems clear that Rubio lumps the font in with those same diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility initiatives. Getting rid of it is an easy (and weirdly petty) way to follow through on the second Trump administration&#39;s anti-DEI stance towards just about everything.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/state-department-calibri-font-was-a-dei-hire-190454957.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2F2025-12%2Fba5eddb1-b322-4b2f-a097-d0877a038ac0&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=1df718f2e579af2677313c3ea7d37829883735ce,https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/state-department-calibri-font-was-a-dei-hire-190454957.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-10T19:04:54Z,7,Tech

"Hackers tricked ChatGPT, Grok and Google into helping them install malware","Ever since reporting earlier this year on how easy it is to trick an agentic browser, I&#39;ve been following the intersections between modern AI and old-school scams. Now, there&#39;s a new convergence on the horizon: hackers are apparently using AI prompts to seed Google search results with dangerous commands. When executed by unknowing users, these commands prompt computers to give the hackers the access they need to install malware.
The warning comes by way of a recent report from detection-and-response firm Huntress. Here&#39;s how it works. First, the threat actor has a conversation with an AI assistant about a common search term, during which they prompt the AI to suggest pasting a certain command into a computer&#39;s terminal. They make the chat publicly visible and pay to boost it on Google. From then on, whenever someone searches for the term, the malicious instructions will show up high on the first page of results.
Huntress ran tests on both ChatGPT and Grok after discovering that a Mac-targeting data exfiltration attack called AMOS had originated from a simple Google search. The user of the infected device had searched &#34;clear disk space on Mac,&#34; clicked a sponsored ChatGPT link and — lacking the training to see that the advice was hostile — executed the command. This let the attackers install the AMOS malware. The testers discovered that both chatbots replicated the attack vector.
As Huntress points out, the evil genius of this attack is that it bypasses almost all the traditional red flags we&#39;ve been taught to look for. The victim doesn&#39;t have to download a file, install a suspicious executable or even click a shady link. The only things they have to trust are Google and ChatGPT, which they&#39;ve either used before or heard about nonstop for the last several years. They&#39;re primed to trust what those sources tell them. Even worse, while the link to the ChatGPT conversation has since been taken off Google, it was up for at least half a day after Huntress published their blog post.
This news comes at a time that&#39;s already fraught for both AIs. Grok has been getting dunked on for sucking up to Elon Musk in despicable ways, while ChatGPT creator OpenAI has been falling behind the competition. It&#39;s not yet clear if the attack can be replicated with other chatbots, but for now, I strongly recommend using caution.

YouTube TV Plans will let you choose genre-specific content packages,"YouTube TV, which launched in 2017 as a $35-per-month all-in-one service, will soon introduce YouTube TV Plans. Although the announcement is light on details, we know the initiative will let you sign up for genre-specific packages, such as sports and news. In other words, it&#39;s the final step in the legacy-cable-ification of the service.YouTube hasn&#39;t said anything about pricing. But it&#39;s probably safe to assume that narrowing your available content will reduce your bill. A year ago, the company raised its monthly cost to $83. That&#39;s 137 percent higher than the service’s launch price nearly nine years ago.We don&#39;t yet have the full list of available plans, but YouTube mentioned packages for sports, news and &#34;family and entertainment content.&#34; As expected, it promised that you can mix and match them. The YouTube TV Sports Plan will include access to all major broadcast channels and several sports networks, like all ESPN networks, FS1, and NBC Sports Network. It sounds similar to offerings from Fubo and DirecTV.YouTube TV plans will launch in early 2026. The current $83 all-in-one model will remain available alongside it.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/youtube-tv-plans-will-let-you-choose-genre-specific-content-packages-182909455.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2Fhamedtaha-Ziv3uwvQwIo-unsplash.jpg&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=b2180e8547f050b43d5bc0ca1e5a399e016a7525,https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/youtube-tv-plans-will-let-you-choose-genre-specific-content-packages-182909455.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-10T18:29:09Z,7,Tech

"Amazon brings same-day deliveries of perishable food items to 1,300 new areas","Amazon is introducing same-day delivery of perishable food items to 1,300 new cities and towns throughout the country, upping the total service area to more than 2,300 locations. This expansion covers cities like Boise, Salt Lake City, Fort Collins, Omaha, Des Moines and many more.
Check the link to see if it has expanded to where you live. The commerce giant says it will be bringing the service to even more cities in 2026, making the platform a real rival to stuff like Instacart and Walmart+.
Amazon introduced this feature earlier this year and it has proven to be quite the success, given today&#39;s move. It lets people order perishable food items like fruits, vegetables, dairy and meat alongside other more traditional items like electronics and books.
Amazon uses a &#34;specialized temperature-controlled fulfillment network” to ensure that perishables remain in tip-top shape and they are delivered in insulated bags. The deliveries are free for Prime members, as long as the order exceeds $25. Everyone else has to pay $13 per order.

The UK government will 'look into' Rockstar's firing of union-organizing workers,"Rockstar Games may have to answer for what appears to be union-busting behavior. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, under pressure from parliament, said the government will &#34;look into&#34; the firing of 31 employees in October.The sacked workers were all part of a private trade union chat group on Discord. The company claimed the firings were &#34;for gross misconduct&#34; and accused the workers of sharing confidential information outside of the company.But based on what we know, it&#39;s hard to see that characterization as anything but union-busting in search of legal cover. The Independent Workers&#39; Union of Great Britain (IWGB) described the case as &#34;the most blatant and ruthless act of union busting in the history of the games industry.&#34;In November, IWGB issued legal claims against the Grand Theft Auto developer. The next day, over 200 staff at Rockstar North signed a letter condemning the firings and pressuring management to reinstate the workers. Earlier that month, the fired workers and their supporters protested outside Rockstar North&#39;s Edinburgh headquarters. Others picketed in Paris, London and New York.Fired workers and supporters protesting outside Rockstar&#39;s headquartersIWGB“It’s clear to everyone close to this situation that this is a blatant, unapologetic act of vicious union busting,” one of the fired staffers said anonymously in a November statement. “Rockstar employs so many talented game developers, all of whom are crucial to making the games we put out.”Edinburgh East and Musselburgh MP Chris Murray, who prompted Starmer&#39;s response, said in parliament that he recently met with Rockstar to discuss the case. &#34;The meeting only entrenched my concerns about the process Rockstar used to dismiss so many of their staff members,&#34; he said. &#34;I was not assured their process paid robust attention to UK employment law, I was not convinced that this course of action was necessary, and alarmingly, I did not leave informed on exactly what these 31 people had done to warrant their immediate dismissal.&#34;Murray added that Rockstar initially refused entry to the MPs unless they signed a non-disclosure agreement. The company eventually relented on that front.On Wednesday, Murray triggered Starmer&#39;s response in parliament. The MP asked the Prime Minister if he agreed that &#34;all companies, regardless of profit size, must follow UK employment law and all workers have the right to join a union?&#34;Starmer replied that he found the case &#34;deeply concerning.&#34; He added that &#34;every worker has the right to join a trade union, and we&#39;re determined to strengthen workers&#39; rights and ensure they don&#39;t face unfair consequences for being part of a union. Our ministers will look into the particular case the member raises and will keep him updated.&#34;This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-uk-government-will-look-into-rockstars-firing-of-union-organizing-workers-174216696.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2F6o3nvn7fqyq61.jpg&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=3bcc01bf6abf5156ebda43e33589078919668e1c,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-uk-government-will-look-into-rockstars-firing-of-union-organizing-workers-174216696.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-10T17:42:16Z,8,Tech
The next Switch Online additions are N64 games Rayman 2: The Great Escape and Tonic Trouble,"Nintendo has announced its Nintendo Switch Online additions for December, which are for all the N64-era 3D platformer fans out there. On December 17, Rayman 2: The Great Escape and Tonic Trouble are joining the Switch’s Nintendo Classics library. As a reminder, N64 games are exclusive to Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers, along with the emulators for the Game Boy Advance, Sega Genesis and GameCube.
For retro gaming completionsists, Tonic Trouble might actually be the more interesting get for NSO, despite being far less well known than the Rayman series. It was Ubisoft’s first 3D platformer, but a number of delays meant it ended up releasing in the same year as Rayman 2, and therefore has become a bit lost to time. The game stars an alien janitor named Ed, who accidentally drops a powerful green tonic out of his spaceship and all over Earth, making a mutated mess of the planet that he has to clean up.


Tonic Trouble was also conceptualized by Rayman creator Michel Ancel, but Ubisoft clearly only had room for one limbless mascot going forward. Arriving in 1999, Rayman 2: The Great Escape was the series’ Super Mario 64 moment, reimagining the original 2D game as a 3D platformer that was met with critical acclaim at launch. These days, the superb Rayman Legends would probably be most fans’ pick for the best game in the long-running series, but Rayman 2 would likely be near the top of the list.
Today’s announcement means that Rayman arrives on the N64 NSO app before Nintendo&#39;s own Donkey Kong 64, which has been one of the most requested games for years. Why the company still hasn’t handed that one over in a year when the big ape made his triumphant 3D platformer comeback remains a mystery. But with the Rayman series kicking off its 30th anniversary celebrations back in September, the arrival of Rayman 2 makes a lot of sense.
Nintendo updated its N64 app for the launch of the Switch 2 earlier this year. Fire it up on today and you can make use of a rewind function, as well as a new CRT filter for optimum nostalgia.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/the-next-switch-online-additions-are-n64-games-rayman-2-the-great-escape-and-tonic-trouble-171500122.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F56ae1c40-d5ea-11f0-bded-a0e2dd04d36e&resize=1400%2C895&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=7f89b846270fa1b83ac9db0f2b9fef54825ff122,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/the-next-switch-online-additions-are-n64-games-rayman-2-the-great-escape-and-tonic-trouble-171500122.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-10T17:15:00Z,8,Tech

Reddit is starting to verify public figures,"Like it or not, the checkmark has become an almost universal symbol on most social platforms, even though its exact meaning can vary significantly between services. Now, Reddit, which historically hasn&#39;t cared that much about its users&#39; identity, is joining the club and starting to test verification for public figures on its platform.The company is beginning &#34;a limited alpha test&#34; of the feature with a small &#34;curated&#34; group of accounts that includes journalists from major media outlets like NBC News and the Boston Globe. Businesses that are already using an &#34;official&#34; badge, which Reddit started testing in 2023, will also now have a grey &#34;verified&#34; checkmark instead of the &#34;official&#34; label. Verification has long been a thorny issue for many platforms. For users, it&#39;s at times been a source of confusion, especially on sites where verified badges only require a paid subscription. Reddit&#39;s approach, at least for now, is closer to how Twitter handled verification prior to Elon Musk&#39;s takeover of the company.The company has handpicked the initial group who will get checkmarks indicating they have verified their identity and seems to be geared around high-visibility accounts. &#34;This feature is designed to help redditors understand who they&#39;re engaging with in moments when verification matters, whether it’s an expert or celebrity hosting an AMA, a journalist reporting news, or a brand sharing information,&#34; Reddit explains in a blog post. &#34;Our approach to verification is voluntary, opt-in, and explicitly not about status. It’s designed to add clarity for redditors and ease the burden on moderators who often verify users manually.&#34; For now, Reddit users — even notable ones — won&#39;t be able to apply for verification. But the company notes that its intention isn&#39;t to limit checkmarks to famous people only. A Reddit spokesperson tells Engadget that &#34;our goal is that anyone who wishes to self-identify will be able to do so in the future.&#34; The company also notes that verification doesn&#39;t come with any exclusive perks, like increased visibility or immunity from the rules of individual subreddits. Reddit requires accounts to be in good standing and already active on the platform in order to be eligible for verification. Accounts that are marked NSFW or that &#34;primarily engage in NSFW-tagged communities&#34; won&#39;t be eligible. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/reddit-is-starting-to-verify-public-figures-170000833.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2Freddit_verified.jpg&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=6015e5e76213576d4784a7147a96598e35edb0a6,https://www.engadget.com/social-media/reddit-is-starting-to-verify-public-figures-170000833.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-10T17:00:00Z,7,Tech
OpenAI's house of cards seems primed to collapse,"OpenAI is in a far less commanding position than it was following the public release of ChatGPT a few short years ago. Back in 2022, the sudden popularity of ChatGPT sent Google into a panic. The company was so worried about the possibility of the upstart chatbot disrupting its Search business, executives sounded a &#34;code red&#34; alert inside of the company and called Sergey Brin and Larry Page out of retirement to help it formulate a response to OpenAI. It then rushed out Bard, announcing its first commercial chatbot on February 6, 2023. Google&#39;s stock tanked days later when the AI incorrectly answered a question about NASA&#39;s James Webb Space Telescope during a public demo. But it wasn&#39;t just Google that wanted a piece of OpenAI, while the search giant sought to compete with it, others — including Microsoft and Apple — made deals with the company to bring its technology to their products and services, all the promise that AI would eventually revolutionize every facet of the economy. Since then, OpenAI has seen its lead against Google and much of the AI industry evaporate, culminating in a series of successive blows throughout 2025. On January 20, the same day Altman was busy rubbing shoulders with other tech oligarchs at Donald Trump’s inauguration, China’s DeepSeek quietly released its R1 chain-of-thought model. A week later, the startup&#39;s chatbot surpassed ChatGPT as the most-download free app on the US App Store. The overnight success of DeepSeek eliminated $1 trillion worth of stock market value, and almost certainly left OpenAI blindsided.In response, the company showed a newfound urgency. In one week, for instance, OpenAI released both o3-mini and Deep Research. It even went so far as to announce the latter on a Sunday evening. But for all its new urgency, OpenAI&#39;s biggest, most important release of the year was a miss. It&#39;s safe to say GPT-5 hasn&#39;t lived up to anyone&#39;s expectations, including OpenAI&#39;s own. The company touted the system as smarter, faster and better than all of its previous models, but after users got their hands on it, they complained of a chatbot that made surprisingly dumb mistakes and didn&#39;t have much of a personality. For many, GPT-5 felt like a downgrade compared to the older, simpler GPT-4o. That&#39;s a position no AI company wants to be in, let alone one that has taken on as much investment as OpenAI.    Anthropic was quick to take advantage of the weakness, signing a deal with Microsoft to bring its Claude models to Copilot 365. Previously, Microsoft depended exclusively on OpenAI for partner models in Copilot. Before the company announced the integration, reporting from The Information said Microsoft made the decision based on the strength of Anthropic&#39;s Sonnet 4.0 model, judging it &#34;perform[ed] better in subtle but important ways&#34; relative to OpenAI&#39;s offerings.   However, what will likely go down as the defining moment occurred a few short weeks after OpenAI announced the conclusion of its restructuring. On November 18, Google released Gemini 3 Pro, and immediately the new model leap-frogged the competition, including GPT-5. As of the writing of this article, Google&#39;s new model is at the top of LMArena, the site where humans compare outputs from different AI systems and vote on the best one. GPT-5, by contrast, is currently ranked sixth overall, behind models from Anthropic and Elon Musk&#39;s xAI.  According to a December 2 report from The Wall Street Journal, Sam Altman sent a companywide memo following the release of Gemini 3 Pro. Echoing the words Google used to describe the situation it found itself against OpenAI in 2023, he called for a &#34;code red&#34; effort to improve ChatGPT. Altman reportedly told employees there would be temporary reassignments and that the company would delay some products, all in an effort to catch up to Google and Anthropic.    The few numbers these companies are willing to share don&#39;t paint a promising picture for OpenAI. Each month, about 800 million people use ChatGPT. On paper, that&#39;s impressive, but Google is catching up there too. In October, the company said the Gemini app had 650 million users, up from 450 million just a few months earlier in July, thanks to the popularity of its Nano Banana Pro image generator. More importantly, OpenAI has an inherent disadvantage against Google. For the search giant, AI may touch everything the company does now, but Gemini is just one product in an extensive portfolio that includes many other popular services. Google can fund its AI advancements with money it makes elsewhere. OpenAI cannot say the same. The company is constantly raising money to stay afloat, and according to a financial roadmap obtained by The Journal, it will need its revenue to grow to about $200 billion annually to become profitable by 2030. In November, Altman said on X the company was on track to hit above $20 billion in annualized revenue this year. In an effort to grow revenue, Altman and company have adopted an incredibly risky strategy. In recent months, OpenAI has signed more than $1.4 trillion worth of infrastructure deals in a bid to outscale the competition that is already beating it. Many of those agreements can only be described as circular, and I think the fears about a financial bubble are real. In the first half of 2025, investment in data centers accounted for nearly all of US GDP growth. Even if there&#39;s not a repeat of the 2008 housing market crisis or the dot-com crash, the AI boom is at the very least poised to make everyday electronics (and utilities) more expensive for regular people in the short term.Since late October, demand for server-grade computer components, including memory and storage, has sent the price of consumer PC parts skyrocketing as manufacturers devote more of their production capacity and wafers to high-margin customers like OpenAI and Google. Since late October, the cost of most RAM kits has doubled and tripled. In November, the price of some SSDs went up by as much as 60 percent. Next year, the cost of LPDDR5X memory, which is used in both smartphones and NVIDIA servers, is expected to climb as well.  &#34;Be it carmakers, smartphones or consumer electronics, everyone that uses memory is facing pressure from price hikes and supply constraints in the coming year,&#34; Zhao Haijun, the co-CEO of memory manufacturer SMIC told analysts, per Bloomberg.Gita Gopinath, former chief economist for the International Monetary Fund, recently estimated that if the AI bubble were to burst, it would wipe out $20 trillion in wealth held by American households. The Great Recession, considered the worst financial meltdown since the Great Depression, reduced US household net worth by $11.5 trillion, and it took years before for American families to rebuild their wealth to pre-recession levels.   The modern AI bubble may have been started by ChatGPT, but given the crowded field of chatbots and LLMs, it won&#39;t necessarily pop should OpenAI go bust. With novelty and technical prowess no longer on its side though, it&#39;s now on Altman to prove in short order why his company still deserves such unprecedented levels of investment. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/openais-house-of-cards-seems-primed-to-collapse-170000900.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2F2025-12%2Fe7984ba8-8716-4447-9111-929659075649&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=62cfe1cfda9a0bc6b661b9c0b26268f86766beeb,https://www.engadget.com/ai/openais-house-of-cards-seems-primed-to-collapse-170000900.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-10T17:00:00Z,10,Tech

Petco accidentally exposed heaps of customer information,"Petco has accidentally exposed a whole lot of customer data and personal information, according to a report by TechCrunch. This is thanks to a security lapse involving its Vetco clinics website, forcing the company to take a portion of that site offline.
Petco has confirmed the leak and TechCrunch noted that the security lapse allowed anyone to download customer records without login information. The exposed data includes customer names, driver&#39;s license numbers, dates of birth, Social Security numbers and even financial information. It also includes customer records from visits to Vetco, like medical histories, pet names, vaccination records and other stuff like that.
This was due to an incorrect software setting that made a number of files accessible online, according to a notice filed by California’s attorney general and reported on by Mashable. The company has since corrected the setting, removed the exposed files and implemented security measures.
However, Petco hasn&#39;t said if any data was actually extracted during the security lapse or if it even has the means to suss out that kind of thing. Vetco customers should probably perform some due diligence to shore up personal security. The company is offering credit and identity monitoring services to impacted customers, but only in some states. We recommend giving Petco a call to discuss options. 
Data breaches of this sort are becoming an unfortunate part of modern life. Recent security breaches have impacted entities like AT&amp;T, Discord, the social network Tea and the human resources company Workday, among others.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/petco-accidentally-exposed-heaps-of-customer-information-163825302.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2Fdc152b40-d5e4-11f0-afbb-0b852bab4370&resize=1400%2C930&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=3d81f663dc81c049a4b3f6f47c663e9b9b251eaf,https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/petco-accidentally-exposed-heaps-of-customer-information-163825302.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-10T16:38:25Z,8,Tech

How can staff+ security engineers force-multiply their impact?,"
		
					  
						




Staff+ engineers play a critical role in designing, scaling and influencing the security posture of an organization. Their key areas of expertise include developing security strategy and governance, incident response leadership, automation, compliance/risk management and cross-org collaboration to shape security culture. Together, these capabilities are essential to enhance application security and the effectiveness of their organizations.



However, in our experience, we have seen that many staff+ security engineers face scaling challenges. Instead of leveraging their expertise to drive broad, cross-stack impact, they tend to concentrate on specific incidents or focus areas, which limits their ability to extend their influence and strategic reach. Such a scaling problem has consequences on the organization and its personal goals. 



Also, leadership considers staff+ engineers as trusted advisors, helping them make high-judgment decisions. However, when engineers tend to get stuck on specific tactical incidents or solutions, leaders are left without their strategic insights. Conversely, staff+ engineers who are too busy in the weeds, miss to proactively look out for their “leaders’ problems.” Leaders perceive these engineers as too busy and hesitate to increase their scope and loop them in broader discussions, which ultimately leads to missed opportunities for the staff+ security engineers. 



There are plenty of practices that staff+ engineers can adopt to enable them to scale and force-multiply their impact across their organization. Remember, you, as a staff+ security engineer, are ultimately an enabler, not a bottleneck!



Practical ideas to help you scale



One of the most common ideas in people management, “scaling through others,” is well-applicable to staff+ security engineers. It basically means amplifying your impact not by doing more work yourself, but by enabling many others to work more effectively and productively with your influence. In other words, you’ll not do best by being a hero, but by creating “mini you’s” across the organization. When applied with discipline, scaling through others’ work well in practical settings. Here are some ideas you can consider: 



Create mechanisms that allow you to scale



Mechanisms enforce or reinforce a behavior automatically. Also, they are not one-size-fits-all, but with some trial and error, we have observed that strong mechanisms consistently support desired behavior. For example, a policy-as-code framework integrated into CI/CD pipelines automatically enforces security and compliance policies, reducing manual checks and human error. While this is an example of a technical mechanism (which we will talk more about in the next section), mechanisms can also be people-oriented, say, mentorship programs or mentorship trees.



Determine where to dive deeper and where to delegate



Being an expert in the area, staff+ engineers can pretty much dive in anywhere from critical incidents to strategic initiatives. They may be drawn in by urgent team needs, their own curiosity or something else. But it is crucial for them to carefully evaluate where to make and avoid costly commitments. Asking a set of targeted questions can provide valuable insight: “What is the potential impact on security posture or risk to the organization?”; “Is there an established process or tooling (‘paved path’) to address this?”; and “Is this a one-time incident or a recurring security challenge that requires a scalable, strategic solution?” Often, true learning comes from failure. If the risk is manageable, allow others to step up and learn from their own failures.



Create a trusted group



To scale through others, you will need a group to rely on. Some organizations solve this problem via job levels, where staff+ engineer roles are defined to scale through other roles like senior security engineers. In other cases, you might need to define your selection criteria and training path. Just creating this group is not enough; an action plan and thorough execution are critical. In practice, such working groups run brown-bag sessions, create mentorship and recognition programs and discuss/review solutions that help lift the organization’s security KPIs. Additionally, mentorship sessions and office hours from staff+ engineers help build working relationships that last.



Employ non-security engineers to the cause



Involving application engineers in the security cause is an often-overlooked “hack” that works well in industrial settings. This “shift-left” approach involves embedding security practices directly into the software development pipeline, enabling development teams to take ownership of security controls and assessments early in the lifecycle. Programs such as security champions or security reviewers empower application engineers to integrate standard security and compliance practices as part of their regular workflows, reducing bottlenecks and fostering a security-first mindset. Staff+ security engineers should look for opportunities to drive the creation of these programs, enable cross-functional collaboration and scale through application engineers to increase their impact. 



Eliminate anti-patterns



Lastly, we would recommend staff+ security engineers to inspect and eliminate anti-patterns in their (and peer) organizations. These anti-patterns work against scaling and make them and their organizations bottlenecks, instead of enablers. One example we have commonly seen is when security engineers act as permanent gatekeepers. This “block by default” approach is expensive and needs significant time investment for staff+ engineers and slows down business. Similarly, policies without exceptions are a time drain for both security and application teams. We highly recommend staff+ security engineers to proactively identify such patterns and replace them with mechanisms.



Technical mechanisms to consider



To effectively scale their impact, staff+ security engineers should champion a comprehensive technical approach that integrates secure practices into every layer of the organization, technology and culture. This ultimately acts as a mechanism or guardrails for their organizations, ensuring their guidance is automatically enforced and allowing them time for strategic influence. Key elements include:




Incorporate focused action areas in the organization-wide security strategy: While staff+ security engineers are responsible for developing a clear, actionable security strategy, we recommend they encompass policy-as-code enforcement, risk gates and continuous monitoring. Leverage the trusted group to assign ownership by appointing area leaders who drive accountability and progress within their domains. Review their findings and tune the strategy periodically. This helps staff+ engineers avoid the need to inspect every aspect of a large organization’s security strategy.



Adopt reference architectures and secure-by-default reusable modules: We recommend staff+ security engineers to build and provide trusted, opinionated blueprints, golden images, baseline policies and reusable components that make secure design the path of least resistance for development teams. Building such “paved paths” enables seamless and secure development for teams without developer whiplash. Finally, using trusted groups to drive adoption, they can effectively influence teams’ technical direction.



Shift-left security practices: Briefly discussed before, integrating security early in the development lifecycle is the central theme of modern-day DevSecOps practices. Embedding automated controls, threat modeling and validation tools into pull requests, CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure-as-code (IaC) plans enables developers to catch and fix issues before deployment without workflow disruption. Consequently, this allows staff+ engineers (and their organizations) to reduce security bugs that reach production.



Leverage AI-driven scanning tools and automation cautiously: The rapid development of GenAI has unlocked significant capabilities in security tooling. AI tools are now available that strengthen security practices through adaptive learning, risk prioritization and context-aware detection. Staff+ security engineers should champion the adoption of these tools to enhance vulnerability detection and streamline workflows. Supplementing these tools with expert reviews helps mitigate false positives and assess the impact of security vulnerabilities effectively.



Guardrails over Gates: We recommend staff+ security engineers to build checks that enforce blocking only on high confidence and high impact security signals, while warning or logging lower risk issues to maintain velocity. Using compensating controls like monitoring, automated remediation and risk scoring to manage risks without blocking progress.




The overall guiding principle we recommend for all staff+ security engineers is to make the secure way the easiest and most intuitive path for all engineers; this helps security to scale sustainably alongside business growth. We believe this guiding principle, along with the above technical framework, enables staff+ security engineers to force-multiply their impact by embedding robust security foundations, fostering a culture of shared ownership and automating enforcement. The result is a resilient, scalable and developer-friendly security posture.



Incident influence



So, how can staff+ security engineers force-multiply their impact during active security incidents? The most critical tool that the engineer has in such a scenario is their mindset: “You’re the stabilizer, not the savior.” Take the role of an orchestrator: If you get too deep into the logs, other areas that need support will suffer. Look to assign tactical work to different individual contributors and focus on leading the incident, coordinating across roles and managing leadership communications. 



Next, it is critical to identify inflection points. You will be expected to make high-velocity, high-judgement decisions that decide the course of incident management. Determine thresholds beyond which upper leadership involvement or additional support is essential. Utilize the inflection points to guide you when to move from containment to recovery to retrospective. Once the situation is in control, switch to an influencer role and scale through others, in line with your standard engagement mechanisms.



Act as a bridge between leadership and teams



Lastly, note that you are a link between management/leadership and engineers on the ground. Managers may not fully understand the details of execution or delays in identifying/remediating vulnerabilities in the software. Teams will rely on you to identify and bridge process gaps or represent them to leadership for decision-making. For example, in our case, our team was hesitating to adopt a powerful static analysis tool. While the team identified it as a critical need, it had high licensing costs, leading to multiple back-and-forth discussions. When our principal staff engineer learned about it, she promptly created a one-page document with the pros and cons and aligned leaders on funding it due to the high return-on-investment. She resolved a two-week team debate and analysis in just one afternoon. 



Conversely, you are also the leadership’s representative on the ground, shepherding the team along the leadership’s direction. Consider influencing the teams in building and reviewing deep visibility dashboards that accurately capture key security insights. This provides leaders with a strong feedback loop and real-time visibility on the consequences of their decisions.



Final thoughts



The journey of a staff+ security engineer is about transitioning from individual contributions to a force multiplier. This is especially important as AI and automation redefine scale; the leaders who design for empowerment will define the next era of cybersecurity engineering.

"CloverPit, a Balatro-style game with a grungy slot machine, hits iOS and Android on December 17","CloverPit is one of my favorite games of the year so far. Developer Panik Arcade took the formula that helped make Balatro so successful — using various tools to bend the rules of the game to help you rack up obscenely high scores — and based it around a slot machine rather than poker. It’s been a hit so far on PC, where it has sold more than a million copies since September, and on Xbox. CloverPit has been among the top 20 most-played titles on Game Pass since its surprise debut there last month. Now, the horror-tinged roguelite is venturing into new territory, as it’s coming to iOS and Android on December 17.The mobile versions of the game are said to have a fully-optimized interface, as well as all of the post-launch updates, such as the Hard Mode that Panik Arcade recently added. CloverPit will cost $5 on mobile and it will have no microtransactions or “predatory mechanics.” That might seem surprising for a game centered around a slot machine, but CloverPit isn’t really about gambling (which the developers say they don’t like anyway). It’s about breaking the rules to tilt the odds in your favor.The setup is pretty straightforward. You’re imprisoned in a rusty cell and you have a rapidly increasing debt to pay off. The only way to do that, and hopefully leave through the door, is to earn enough coins from the slot machine to pay what you owe. There are more than 150 items (which are called charms here) to experiment with that affect things like the number of spins, how much each symbol or pattern is worth and how many tickets you earn. Tickets are what you need to buy more charms.Figuring out combinations of items that work well together is key to quickly scaling up the number of coins and tickets you can earn from each visit to the slot machine. Fail to pay off your debt by a deadline (i.e. after a certain number of spins) and it’s game over, as you plunge into the titular pit. CloverPit is strange and beguiling and heaps of fun. I’ve plowed around 39 hours into it on Steam, and I’m sure it’ll take up much of my attention on my phone after it hits mobile next week. Doomspinning seems slightly healthier for my brain than doomscrolling.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/cloverpit-a-balatro-style-game-with-a-grungy-slot-machine-hits-ios-and-android-on-december-17-154500028.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2Fcloverpit_1464.jpg&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=68f39a3bb484848a4d5fd56ab1bb7f9f01016240,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/cloverpit-a-balatro-style-game-with-a-grungy-slot-machine-hits-ios-and-android-on-december-17-154500028.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-10T15:45:00Z,8,Tech

Hundreds of Ivanti EPM systems exposed online as critical flaw patched,"
		
					  
						




Ivanti has patched a critical vulnerability in Endpoint Manager that enables attackers to hijack administrator sessions without authentication and potentially control thousands of enterprise devices.



The company released EPM version 2024 SU4 SR1 to address four vulnerabilities, including the critical flaw tracked as CVE-2025-10573, which carries a CVSS score of 9.6. Three additional high-severity flaws could also enable code execution but require user interaction, Ivanti said in its December security advisory on Tuesday.



Ivanti said the vulnerabilities were reported through its responsible disclosure program, adding that it was not aware of any customer systems being exploited at the time of disclosure.



EPM has been targeted before. In March, CISA added three EPM vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog after confirming exploitation in the wild. The flaws had been patched in January after being reported privately to Ivanti.



Given EPM’s history of being targeted by attackers and the severity of the flaw, security teams should treat this as a patch-immediately situation rather than a routine update.



The December update also fixed CVE-2025-13659 and CVE-2025-13662, which allow attackers to execute arbitrary code when users connect to an untrusted core server or import untrusted configuration files. Another enables unauthorized file writes on the server.



Unauthenticated attack vector



The most severe vulnerability is a stored cross-site scripting flaw discovered by Ryan Emmons, staff security researcher at Rapid7, who reported it to Ivanti in August.



According to Rapid7’s technical disclosure, also published Tuesday, attackers can submit malicious device scan data to EPM’s incoming data API without authentication, The malicious data gets processed and embedded in the EPM web dashboard, where it executes when administrators view affected pages.



“An attacker with unauthenticated access to the primary EPM web service can join fake managed endpoints to the EPM server in order to poison the administrator web dashboard with malicious JavaScript,” Emmons wrote in the report.



Once the malicious JavaScript executes, attackers gain control of the admin session with full privileges to remotely control endpoints and install software on devices.



Nick Tausek, lead security automation architect at Swimlane, warned, “Exploitation of this flaw would grant threat actors access to many managed devices at once, allowing for the execution of malicious code, deployment of ransomware, or exfiltration of sensitive data.”



The patching challenge



Despite the severity of such threats, organizations frequently struggle to address critical vulnerabilities quickly: Tausek said Swimlane research found 68% of organizations leave critical flaws unpatched for over 24 hours and 55% don’t have a comprehensive system for prioritizing vulnerabilities.



The delay is particularly risky for endpoint management systems, which run with elevated privileges and control thousands of devices. Successful exploitation could bypass security controls and allow attackers to push malware to managed endpoints, modify security configurations, or establish persistent backdoors across the enterprise.



“The potential for a serious exploitation campaign should not be overlooked,” Tausek said.



Pattern of exploitation



That concern is not theoretical. EPM’s history makes rapid patching more urgent. CISA added three EPM vulnerabilities (CVE-2024-13159, CVE-2024-13160, and CVE-2024-13161) to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog in March after confirming active exploitation. The agency flagged another exploited EPM flaw (CVE-2024-29824) in October.



The repeated targeting demonstrates EPM’s value to attackers seeking persistent network access and lateral movement capabilities. Once attackers compromise endpoint management infrastructure, they can spread across the enterprise rapidly.



Deployment guidance



The patch is available through the Ivanti License System and applies to EPM versions 2024 SU4 and earlier. Organizations running the 2022 branch should note that it reaches end of life in October 2025 and will no longer receive security updates after that date, the  Ivanti advisory added.



Security teams should prioritize updating EPM instances to version 2024 SU4 SR1 immediately, particularly any installations accessible from untrusted networks. Organizations with internet-facing EPM instances face the highest risk and should patch within 24 hours.



For organizations that can’t patch immediately, the advisory recommended ensuring EPM management interfaces aren’t exposed to the public internet and implementing strict network segmentation to isolate management servers from untrusted networks.



Tausek also recommended training administrators to recognize social engineering attacks, since the critical XSS vulnerability requires viewing a poisoned dashboard page to trigger.



“Since EPMs often run with high privileges, any misuse of it risks bypassing security controls and rapidly escalating the impact of a breach,” Tausek added.

Apple's Studio Display is $230 off right now,"Apple’s Studio Display hasn’t been updated since it launched in 2022, but it remains one of the best monitors for the Mac-oriented, and right now you can pick one up for $230 off. This deal applies specifically to the tilt-adjustable model, which means you can’t adjust the height of the built-in stand. That might be a deal-breaker for some users, but if not, $1,368 is a near-record low. 

  
The Studio Display was a product that Apple devotees had been asking the company to make for years. As well as being a solid 27-inch 5K LED monitor, it also packs in a variety of ports and some surprisingly good speakers. In our 80-scoring review at the time, we praised its bright and color-accurate screen, while bemoaning the fact that it isn&#39;t as smooth as Apple’s many ProMotion-equipped devices. 
If you’re content with what&#39;s already on offer, this is a good deal on what has always been a very expensive luxury device, but bear in mind that there are swirling rumors of a next generation Studio Display that could arrive in 2026. Mark Gurman of Bloomberg reported earlier this year that Apple might currently have two new models in the works, though it isn’t clear if both will end up making it to retail.

Behind the breaches: Case studies that reveal adversary motives and modus operandi,"
		
					  
						




In today’s threat landscape, it’s no longer enough to focus solely on malware signatures and IP addresses. Defenders must understand how adversaries think, organize and operate, because attacker intent and methodology are now just as critical as technical artifacts. Recent developments have provided rare visibility into the internal processes of modern threat groups, how they coordinate, communicate, exploit vulnerabilities and adapt their tooling in real time. This kind of behind-the-scenes insight is becoming indispensable as cyber threats grow more sophisticated, more specialized and more tightly aligned with financial or strategic objectives. 



We’ve analyzed a series of recent real-world incidents to better understand evolving threat actor behavior. Let’s take a closer look at what these cases reveal.



The BlackBasta chat leak



BlackBasta is often viewed as a tightly run ransomware operation, but internal leaks tell a very different story. The BlackBasta chat leak exposes the group’s behind-the-scenes reality, revealing not a polished, corporate-style criminal enterprise but a fragmented ecosystem marked by hierarchy issues, operational stress, shifting loyalties and deep-seated mistrust among members.



At the top of the structure sits Oleg (aka Tramp), acting as the de facto operations director. The chats depict him as the ultimate decision-maker on campaigns, revenue distribution and targeting rules, including strategic exclusions such as avoiding Russian financial institutions. His leadership, however, is portrayed as opaque and self-interested, with several members openly questioning whether their earnings and workloads reflect fair compensation.



Bio functions as the operation’s central technical architect, managing everything from infrastructure stability to access orchestration. His background under the alias “Pumba” in the Conti collective reinforces the well-known pattern of talent migrating across ransomware-as-a-service ecosystems. Despite his skill set, the chats show Bio repeatedly expressing paranoia about state surveillance, especially following his release from detention, underscoring the constant psychological pressure faced by operators.



Lara handles administrative tasks under heavy workload and stress, reportedly receiving less compensation than others despite being central to operations.



The presence of actors like Cortes, with ties to Qakbot, demonstrates how ransomware crews frequently outsource expertise, rely on external access brokers or pull in operators with malware-specific experience as needed. This kind of crossover, visible only when internal dialogues spill out, shows how interconnected the cybercriminal ecosystem truly is.



The chats further reveal operational inefficiencies that contradict the polished image these groups try to project. Members complain about slow decision-making, unclear leadership directives and disorganized workflows. Disputes over profit sharing, workload assignment and campaign prioritization point toward a group struggling to maintain cohesion. Even discussions around infrastructure updates, task delegation and encryption deployments show signs of technical debt and inconsistent coordination.



Ultimately, the BlackBasta chat leak demystifies the myth of ransomware groups as disciplined, unified machines. Instead, it exposes a loose federation of operators bound together by profit but pulled apart by mistrust, emotional strain, resource imbalance and competing for personal agendas. For defenders, these insights offer not only a rare psychological snapshot of threat actor behavior but also a reminder that even the most feared cybercriminal groups are vulnerable to the same organizational weaknesses that plague legitimate enterprises.



The dual life of EncryptHub



What if the same threat actor breaching networks turned around and got a “Thank-you” note for reporting the flaws they once exploited? In a curious twist, Microsoft credited “EncryptHub“, a persona long tied to malware campaigns, credential theft and access brokering, for responsibly disclosing two Windows vulnerabilities in March 2025. Better known by aliases like SkorikARI and LARVA-208, this actor demonstrates a striking contradiction: simultaneously engaging in cybercrime while positioning themselves as a security researcher. When adversaries start submitting bug reports, the boundary between black-hat activity and legitimate vulnerability disclosure becomes increasingly blurred.



Both vulnerabilities patched in Microsoft’s March Patch Tuesday were attributed to an individual with a documented history of malicious operations, including distributing malware through spoofed WinRAR websites and compromising hundreds of high-value targets across Europe and Asia. Unlike hierarchical ransomware groups, EncryptHub functions as a solo operator, shifting fluidly between freelance development, ad-hoc bug bounty submissions and illicit intrusion campaigns. Reports also indicate the use of ChatGPT to automate code generation, reconnaissance scripting and communication, reducing workload while enabling faster operational tempo.



This case highlights a growing trend in the threat landscape: actors who no longer fit into fixed categories. Instead of being exclusively criminal or exclusively “researcher,” many now oscillate between both based on financial incentives, operational pressure and perceived risk. The acknowledgment from Microsoft underscores the uncomfortable reality that modern threat actors are increasingly hybrid strategic, opportunistic and adaptive. Understanding this duality is essential for evaluating their psychology, long-term intent and the evolving gray zone where legitimate security research and cybercrime increasingly intersect.



BlackLock’s open recruitment tactics



What happens when ransomware operators start posting job ads? BlackLock’s recent recruitment campaigns reveal an increasingly brazen and industrialized cybercrime ecosystem, one where threat actors no longer rely solely on stealth but openly solicit personnel to scale their operations. The group has been aggressively searching for “traffers,” a role dedicated to funneling compromised traffic and delivering ready-to-exploit victims. These recruitment efforts, found across Russian-language underground forums such as RAMP as well as gated Telegram channels, highlight a maturing supply-chain model in ransomware operations.



This traffer-driven workflow is designed to offload the riskiest phase of the attack chain – initial access to external contractors. By outsourcing victim acquisition, BlackLock minimizes its operational exposure while ensuring a consistent inflow of compromised endpoints, credentials and exploitable network footholds. The model mirrors legitimate gig-economy structures but operates with criminal specialization, where traffers focus exclusively on harvesting access through phishing, malware loaders or traffic distribution systems, while the core BlackLock operators handle encryption, negotiation mechanics and monetization.



This level of open recruitment signals growing confidence within the ransomware underground. It further reflects the shift toward modular cybercrime-as-a-service ecosystems, where roles are distributed, attack components are interchangeable and entry barriers for aspiring threat actors continue to fall. Understanding this recruitment strategy is crucial, as the traffer economy significantly accelerates ransomware proliferation and underscores how deeply commoditized initial access has become.



Understanding, foresight, anticipation



Through this analysis, we’ve explored not just isolated incidents, but the broader behavioral patterns, operational workflows and strategic decision-making that define modern threat actors. By understanding how these adversaries adapt, coordinate and exploit emerging opportunities, we gain the foresight needed to anticipate their next moves and continuously refine our defense strategies. As threat actor behaviors evolve, we’ll continue to publish deeper insights and actionable intelligence to help the cybersecurity community stay informed, resilient and one step ahead.

Projectors won us over in 2025,"Not long ago, you may have thought of projectors as complicated, unreliable or just too expensive. In 2025, though, consumer sentiment started to flip. Companies like Anker and Valerion made the projector experience more practical and immersive, helping drive consumer interest and, ultimately, sales.
This shift has been quite a few years in the making. LG helped kickstart the projector renaissance back at CES 2018 when it introduced its unusual-looking CineBeam HU80K projector that could provide a 150-inch image. The next year at CES saw the dawn of the ultra short-throw (UST) laser projector that could create a similarly large display while sitting just inches from your wall. Another big technological upgrade over the following years was the bright and long-lasting laser light engines that replaced weaker, more fragile bulbs.
The timing couldn’t have been better for projector manufacturers. When COVID shut down theaters in 2020, consumers were forced to get their entertainment at home. Many wanted something akin to a movie theater experience — both indoors and out — and thus interest in projectors started to take off.
In 2025, though, projectors really entered the zeitgeist thanks to two new products. The first was Anker’s SoundCore Nebula X1, the highest-rated home theater product Engadget reviewed this year. It comes with a triple-laser engine that allows for 3,500 lumens of brightness — enough that you can watch it during the day. It also uses liquid cooling to reduce annoying fan noise and offers color-accurate picture quality with support for Dolby Vision HDR.
Even better, it can be carried outside easily via the retractable handle and used for movie nights under the stars. If you splurge for the Soundcore Nebula X1 Pro version that comes with huge party speakers, you can even expect excellent sound quality. It also looks sleek and modern, unlike the plasticky models normally aimed at mid-range buyers.
However, the most interesting feature — which is new for a projector in this price range — is the motorized tilting lens that automatically fits the picture to your screen or surface. That allows buyers to set up the Nebula X1 themselves in just a few minutes, rather than hours. That also makes it easy to move the projector around and use in another location.
Valerion
The other model that captured our imagination was the Valerion VisionMaster Max. This projector shares many traits of the Nebula X1, like Dolby Vision, a triple laser system and automatic setup. It’s also a nice-looking, modern product.
However, it has two other innovations that made it extra interesting. The first is the dynamic iris and its Enhanced Black Level technology. That had reviewers raving about its deep black levels that were comparable to projectors like JVC’s NZ8 that cost twice as much. The other is the so-called anti-rainbow technology, which eliminates most of the rainbow-hued strobing that appears with models using Texas Instruments DLP chips. This resolves a common complaint with mid-range projectors.
For a similar price as a good quality TV ($1,500 - $3,000), these models can beam an image double the size. And to install one, you just need to position the projector in front of the screen, roughly center it and hit “calibrate” to get a perfect image.
Both the X1 and VisionMaster Max were first announced on Kickstarter and became the top two projectors ever sold on the site. Plus, several projector models, particularly from Anker/Soundcore, appeared on Google’s gadget search trends. All of that is helping the home projector market increase to the point that it’s, well, projected to nearly double by 2030.
As people researched these products, they may have noticed the other advantages. Along with movies, they’re also great for gaming and sports, particularly if you have a big group of people. In fact, they actually take up less room than a TV if both the projector and screen are ceiling mounted. And many models are portable, battery-powered and bright enough to use outside for parties and camping.
Steve Dent for Engadget
A prime example of a recent projector convert is Engadget editor and cinema podcaster Devindra Hardawar, who explained why he decided to make the leap. “I know big TVs have gotten cheaper, but they still can&#39;t reach the massive 120-inch screen size of my Formovie ultra-short throw projector,” he said. “It makes watching anything feel truly cinematic, and not like I&#39;m just staring at another screen.”
Even though projectors are gaining some ground, they won’t replace TVs for most people. Mid-range televisions still cost less at around $1,000. TVs are obviously easier to install and more convenient to use, as all projectors need time to warm up. TVs are much brighter, too: even dim models put out at least 500 nits of brightness, compared to 200 to 300 nits max for very bright projectors. However, even though projector setups are less tricky than before, you still need to buy and install a screen for optimal performance, which adds cost and complexity.
How much more can projectors improve? I think they’ll continue to get brighter, more color accurate and even easier to install. Another piece of technology with potential to reduce complexity and improve image quality is the roll-up screen. If those come down in price enough, they may convince some buyers to replace their TVs with a projector. They’re still likely to remain a niche product, but for cinephiles who want a theater-like experience, projectors are now a more compelling option.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/projectors-won-us-over-in-2025-143655492.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-07%2F17745930-67c3-11f0-acd7-b1d7cc04d675&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=e0891ab0beb29e2d0fd31f9236ca47afde39551e,https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/projectors-won-us-over-in-2025-143655492.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-10T14:36:55Z,13,Tech

"Kindle Scribe Colorsoft review: A very particular set of skills, for a price","In a world where notifications persistently compete for our attention, distraction-free ereaders and writing tablets have found an audience. Putting your phone, laptop or iPad aside and curling up with a Kindle or a reMarkable tablet have become an almost ironic way for the tech-savvy to disconnect from online noise and focus on reading and writing. It’s debatable how broad the appeal of these devices is, but even in what appears to be a relatively small slice of the industry, the competition is fierce. 
Amazon is arguably the biggest name in the space, with its Kindles dominating the ereader market for years. When it introduced the Kindle Scribe in 2022, the company made a play for the burgeoning E Ink writing tablet category, and just last year it launched its first color ereader with the Kindle Colorsoft. Put all those features — reading, writing and color — together, and you’ve got the ingredients for Amazon’s latest contender: the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft. 
This time, Amazon expanded the Scribe line by releasing three new Scribes at once. The entry-level model is the black-and-white tablet without a front light, which costs $430. For $70 more, you’ll get the front light, and then the Colorsoft version goes for $630. There are upgrades from last year’s Scribe across the trio, and for this review we’ll be looking mostly at the Colorsoft, which has all of the new features. 
Like with previous models of the Scribe, Amazon doesn’t indicate the generation number in the name, simply calling this lineup the “all-new Kindle Scribe,” attaching the word Colorsoft to the edition that renders colors. To avoid confusion, I’ll occasionally be referring to this generation of the device as the Scribe 3, and the version from last year as the Scribe 2. 
Editor’s note: As I only received the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft on December 8 due to shipping delays, I won’t be assigning a score to this device until I have had more time to test it. My colleague Valentina Palladino received the new Kindle Scribe a few days before that, and has contributed testing and impressions to this review. It’s also worth noting that some new features, like “Send to Alexa+,” “Story so far” and “Ask this book” aren’t available to test yet. We will update this review with a score after spending more time with it so we can better gauge things like battery life and the usefulness of some software features. 

  
What’s new with the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft 
Aside from the obvious, which is that the Colorsoft can now render colors, the latest Kindle Scribes also feature a refined design, improved front light system, updated screen architecture, new quad-core chip, more memory and Oxide display technology. It has a larger 11-inch screen compared to the 10.2-inch display on its predecessor, and still manages to weigh 33 grams less at 400 grams (0.88 pounds). There’s also a revamped Home page that houses a Quick Note for easier access to the writing interface as well as some software and AI tools that aren’t available to test yet. 
A lot of the hardware tweaks translated to a snappier, more responsive device overall. In my testing, the Scribe Colorsoft’s AI summarization and handwriting refinements took a bit less time than the Scribe 2, which I attribute most to the processor, but I also noticed improved fluidity in the writing experience. 
Drawing on the Scribe Colorsoft brings me right back to my younger days testing out pens at bookstores. Amazon’s stylus feels like a pen with ink that flows more freely and consistently onto the page than others, and between the nib and the texture of the page there is a lack of resistance and overall smoothness that is very satisfying.

Amazon said that the Premium Pen that comes with the Scribes has been refined with a thicker and more rounded silhouette. With its latest Oxide display, the Scribe Colorsoft’s screen response rate of 14 milliseconds and the non-Colorsoft Scribe 3’s rates of 12ms are both much higher than the 20-21ms for the Scribe 2. Together, this probably is the main reason that the new Scribe feels more responsive in general, and why writing on it seems so smooth. Although, that new front light system might also be contributing to the overall feeling of freshness. 
Speaking of, I put the Scribe 2 and Scribe Colorsoft side by side in my friend’s living room and the difference was stark. When I brought both devices next to the window, under direct sunlight, they both seemed similarly bright, with the typical glare-free finish you’d expect of ereaders. But when I took them into a darkened bedroom, the auto-adjusting panel on the Colorsoft lit up its screen and made it easier to read. Colors popped, and while I felt that there was a slight blue tinge to the light, it wasn’t something I would’ve noticed without a side-by-side comparison. It’s not an issue though because you can also adjust the warmth here like you can on other Kindles. 
One of my complaints in my review of the Scribe 2 was the flimsy attachment method of magnets holding the pen to the tablet. While Amazon hasn’t built an onboard slot or holder for the stylus, it did increase the magnetic force on the Scribe 3. This was already noticeable during my hands-on with the device back in October, and in real-world use I appreciated this upgrade in keeping the Premium Pen tightly attached to the Scribe Colorsoft. I would still prefer a more secure approach, since I still do worry about the stylus getting lost in my purse and don’t want to have to buy a case just for this purpose. But it’s a small quibble and my concerns have largely been allayed with the increased magnetism.

I still need to test some software features like Send to Alexa+, Ask This Book and Story So Far, but they’re not available yet. I’ve been focusing my testing on the Notebook section and need to spend more time marking up and annotating books to better evaluate that use case. But not much has changed there since Amazon rolled out the collapsible margins in February, and you can read my review of the Scribe 2 for my impressions there. 
The new home page and AI-powered Notebook search 
At the moment, I can speak to one of the new features: AI-powered Notebook search. The Search bar at the top of the Scribe can now answer questions about the contents of all your Notebooks (and books). At the time of the Scribe’s announcement, I thought this would be helpful in pulling together all the tasks I’d assigned to specific team members across the to-do lists I drew up for various events. 
When I asked the Scribe “what tasks have I assigned Sam,” its results page showed six categories, pulling information from my library, notebooks, the Kindle Store, the Audible Store, Goodreads and text within books. Only the second one had any findings. Under “Results in your notebooks,” there was a label “AI-powered insights” followed by a header “Sam’s Assigned Tasks.” Below that was a bulleted list, which I’ll transcribe and include an image of here:

I quickly realized that I’d need to fine-tune my requests to get results that made more sense, since random tasks divorced from their parent documents made little sense without context. Thankfully, there was a button below the results that prompted me to “Ask Notebooks” about “these insights, or ask something else.” However, tapping that only brought me to a different page showing the same list but with a new section to see the notes they were sourced from. 
I’ll also point out that this list of tasks for Sam was not the same result I got from a query about “where do I mention Sam?” In addition to the two to-do lists that I created in December 2023 and January of this year, the Scribe told me “Sam appears on a Christmas shopping list as one of the checked-off friends.” 
That’s fairly impressive, since that list did have Sam under a handwritten header “Friends,” as opposed to other pages titled “Gym” or “Neighbors.” But it appeared to only be able to determine that Sam’s name was checked off thanks to the template I used for the notebook. Other check marks I made outside the predefined boxes in that background weren’t deemed as checks and instead misrecognized as dashes. So later when I asked where my friend Michelle appeared in all my notebooks, the Scribe noted an entry for “Michelle-scart” in a different holiday shopping page. 
Retrying the same question did yield more accurate results, though, with a subsequent search correctly stating “Michelle appears in a list with ‘scarf’ noted next to her name.” And whether it’s my overly messy handwriting to blame or Amazon’s technological deficiencies, there were still some words or sentences that it misidentified, like “Michelle-callin” instead of “Michelle — Callie.” 
So far, the AI-powered Search feels like a hit-or-miss update. Sometimes, like when I took the bait and asked the questions it suggested, I would get shockingly accurate answers. “Try asking ‘which Ariana song is mentioned in the list,’” the Scribe prompted. Or “When is the HOA meeting occurring?” For the former, it told me that the song “Bang Bang” was on a list of karaoke songs, while the latter simply told me the date and time it had found in a note titled “Appointments Dec 2022.” I’ll need more time to think of better ways to use this feature, but for now I can’t decide if it’s actually helpful without some extra work.

I already spent some time testing the Summarize and Refine tools introduced in the last Kindle Scribe, so I’ll just say that refining the handwriting of a to-do list on the Scribe Colorsoft was largely the same as before, just a tad faster. I didn’t really use either AI tool in the year since I reviewed the Scribe 2, so I was right last year in thinking I wouldn’t find much use for them in daily practice. 
What I thought would be more practical is the redesigned Home screen and the Quick Note that takes up the top left corner of this page. Again, I’d need to spend much more time to understand how I’d navigate the device over weeks and months, but for the most part I find it easy to just hop in and out of notes I want without first going to the Home section. I’d prefer a hardware shortcut like Montblanc offers in its Digital Paper writing tablet. On that device, you can program the buttons on the pen so that a double click starts a new note, adds a blank page or brings you back home.  
While you can customize the button on Amazon’s Premium Pen, your options are limited to switching between tools like the highlighter, pen, shader or eraser for use while you’re writing. (And yes, like before, you can still use the top of the Premium Pen to erase content — no need to push any button.) 
One last thing to note about the home page (for now) is that seeing the rows of book covers in color is a delight, and though it’s not something that impacts the function of the device, it certainly adds a layer of visual pleasure. 
How does the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft compare to the competition? 
One of the Scribe Colorsoft’s main competitors is the reMarkable Paper Pro. The latter has a larger 11.8-inch screen and, correspondingly, weighs a lot more at 525 grams (1.16 pounds). Though I prefer the sharp lines of the reMarkable to the rounded edges and corners of the Scribe, I find the Kindle’s size much more manageable, especially when I’m writing for more than five minutes. 
Importantly, the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft simply has a better screen than the reMarkable. It delivers brighter, more saturated colors, and supports more hues, too. Plus, when I placed them next to each other, the Paper Pro seemed to have a yellow cast and a dimmer screen overall (even at maximum brightness). And when I use the highlight function on each, the reMarkable device “flashes” — meaning you have to give it a second for the color to appear in its final form after you put the stylus to the screen. Meanwhile, the color that shows up on the Colorsoft’s panel as soon as you write on it doesn’t change — no flashing takes place.

The Scribe’s other strengths are its superior performance and Amazon’s ecosystem of books (for those like me who already have large Kindle libraries, anyway). Though it does offer AI features that reMarkable doesn’t, I’m generally leery of those tools, and, as already detailed in this review, they don’t usually help me. 
However, the reMarkable remains the winner when it comes to writing software. It’s way more versatile than Amazon in this respect, especially with its ability to have handwritten and typed text coexist within the same document. You can also edit a note from reMarkable’s app on your phone, typing in any last-minute additions to your shopping list and bolding, italicizing or formatting them if you like. And if you’re a power user, getting your favorite ebooks onto the reMarkable tablet isn’t too difficult, provided you have the EPUB files. 
I’ll also shout out companies like Kobo and Boox, who also make color-rendering ereaders that you can write on. Boox’s Note Air 5c starts at $530 and includes the stylus and a magnetic case for that price. It supports apps via the Google Play Store, but, as our deputy editor Valentina Palladino cautions, isn’t the most beginner-friendly product. Kobo, on the other hand, makes color ereaders like the Libra Color. Although it does support stylus input, it is much smaller with its 7-inch display. 
And for those who aren’t too fussed about color, there are plenty of black-and-white E Ink writing tablets, including the $905 Montblanc Digital Paper, which I’ve been testing for a few weeks. I’m finishing up my review but that one is clearly a luxury product targeted at a much more niche audience than the already limited target market for this category of devices. If your budget is tight, I’d recommend skipping the Colorsoft model unless it’s crucial to your process. $500 is a much easier price to stomach. 
Who should get the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft? 
I hesitate to recommend anyone buy anything before I’ve had enough time to assign a score, since things like battery life take longer to evaluate. And while I continue to test the device to get a better sense for its battery life, I’ve already noticed that like the Scribes before it, this version doesn’t last as long as other Kindles. Amazon promises weeks of reading and writing per charge, which could be anything between two and ten (or more) weeks. 
In my experience so far, the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft dropped about 20 percent in two days, which, mathematically, means it would struggle to even last a week, not to mention multiple weeks. But because the Scribe 2 showed similar battery drain during my review (with heavier use) and manages to stay charged for at least a month when I’m not testing it all day every day, I’m willing to believe Amazon’s promise of greater runtime. 
Aside from my reservations about battery life, the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft is a competent device that delivers on most of its promises so far. The biggest knock against it is its price. At $500 for the monochrome model and $630 for color, this is one Amazon product that can be more expensive than the competition. 
But it’s not without its strengths. I’d think of the Kindle Scribe 3 (and Colorsoft) as an E Ink tablet that is more of a notebook than a portal for textbooks you can mark up, with a robust library of Kindle titles to boot. The AI features are not crucial to the experience, but they also stay out of the way. For those looking for a more sophisticated and versatile writing tablet that is less of a book replacement, the reMarkable Paper Pro is the superior device. And for people who don’t mind the notifications, apps and alerts that these purpose-driven tablets keep from distracting you, there’s always the option of buying an iPad or an Android tablet with a stylus. Just install minimal apps or block all notifications, and you might even save hundreds of dollars in the process.

Wrap-up 
I hate to admit it, but Amazon’s devices and services chief Panos Panay was right in calling the Kindle Scribe a 2-in-1. But the two functions it serves are very specific. I think of the Scribe devices as Kindles first and foremost. That means they’re ereaders, capable of substituting stacks of books thanks to their digital libraries and eye-friendly screens. The second role the Scribe plays well is that of a notebook substitute. It is a place to hold endless slips of digital paper, and its search function can competently help you find what you jotted down in a random note years ago. 
But Amazon has not yet found a way to deliver on features like annotating and marking up ebooks that feels like pen-and-paper. Trying to mark up a digital textbook on the Scribe still feels unintuitive, involving virtual sticky notes, collapsible margins and inserting boxes within lines of text. And you won’t be able to easily edit your notes if you’re away from your Scribe, unlike how you can on a reMarkable product. 
So the Kindle Scribe 3 is not a three- or four-in-one. I don’t have a problem with that, especially without the extra cost that comes with the color capabilities. While the Colorsoft model is superior to the competition at the moment, it also comes at a premium. If you’re looking for the best color E Ink writing tablet available and are willing to splurge, the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft is worth consideration.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/kindle-scribe-colorsoft-review-a-very-particular-set-of-skills-for-a-price-140014961.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F3cf33e40-d566-11f0-9699-69253ba9f5f6&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=3d860c56e9addc1c46a7a1390dfad10a2f657d63,https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/kindle-scribe-colorsoft-review-a-very-particular-set-of-skills-for-a-price-140014961.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-10T14:00:14Z,11,Tech

EU pledges 90 percent cut to carbon emissions by 2040,"The European Union has provisionally agreed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 90 percent (based on 1990 levels) by 2040, the EU parliament announced in a press release. That goes beyond the goals of most other major economies, including China, but falls short of the original one recommended by the EU&#39;s climate science advisors. &#34;The target delivers on the need for climate action while safeguarding our competitiveness and security,&#34; said Denmark&#39;s minister Lars Aagaard, who helped negotiate the deal. 
The new accord — a vital step in the bloc&#39;s long-term goal of achieving climate neutrality by 2050 — was a political compromise months in the making. On one hand, countries like Poland and Hungary argued that deeper cuts would be too onerous for industries already facing high energy costs. And on the other, members including Spain and Sweden said action was needed to help blunt extreme weather events and allow the EU to catch up with China in green tech manufacturing. 
To achieve the target, European industries will need to reduce emissions by 85 percent and sell carbon credits to developing nations to make up the balance. The EU also agreed on an option to use additional international carbon credits (up to five percent) to soften the impact on industry and to delay a carbon tax for fuel by a year to 2028. 
Even with the reduced targets Europe is more committed than all other major polluters, having already cut emissions 37 percent from 1990 levels. During the same period, the US has only managed a reduction of about 7 percent, according to Statista. And under the Trump administration, the US has once again pulled out of the Paris climate accord, scrubbed references to climate change from government sites and promoted polluting energy sectors like coal and gas. 
The deal must still be ratified by the EU parliament and individual countries to become law. Normally, though, that&#39;s a formality for such pre-agreed deals.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/general/eu-pledges-90-percent-cut-to-carbon-emissions-by-2040-133919256.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F98ce8e80-d5c6-11f0-bffd-350ece2cafb0&resize=1400%2C895&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=0e00cf7449bc44a1f263c07acdd630d33e65acc4,https://www.engadget.com/general/eu-pledges-90-percent-cut-to-carbon-emissions-by-2040-133919256.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-10T13:39:19Z,7,Tech

To see and control the Reels algorithm, tap the icon in the upper right corner (two lines with hearts) to open Your Algorithm. It will show what topics Instagram thinks you&#39;re interested in, then you can specify which ones you want to see more or less of and your recommendations will adapt. You can fine tune topics as well: 

See your top interests: View a summary of the topics Instagram thinks you care about most, right at the top.
Tune your preferences: Type in the topics you want to see more or less of, and your Reels will reflect your choices.
Share your algorithm: If you’d like, you can share your interests to your Story, so friends and followers can see what you’re into.

Another AI &#34;feature&#34; that surfaced yesterday on the platform didn&#39;t go over well with some users. It was discovered that Instagram was generating sensational and often inaccurate headlines that were likely created by an LLM. And you can expect AI to infiltrate its apps even more down the road, judging by the company&#39;s recent acquisitions and priority shifts.

Quantum meets AI: The next cybersecurity battleground,"
		
					  
						




In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has been spreading its tentacles across the global technological landscape, as evidenced by the increase in autonomous and automated technologies and their deployment across industries and sectors. While the world is still recovering from the global impact of AI, quantum computing is gradually emerging. In quantum computing, the principles of quantum mechanics are used to perform calculations, enabling the solution of complex problems faster than classical computers. Some have described the recent AI boom and the soon-to-be fully emerged quantum as the ‘mind’ and ‘muscle’ respectively. If this analogy is true, one can only imagine the resultant effect when the ‘mind’ meets the ‘muscle’, and that is where we are heading.



The collision of these two technologies promised to be the next major technological battleground capable of shaping computing, cybersecurity and even geopolitical power structures. With these two forces, not only will the way we compute be redefined in the 21st century, but also how power, privacy and innovation will be distributed. This is because, while AI algorithms are known to recognize patterns and learning from data that was fed into them, quantum computers are capable of exploring multiple paths simultaneously, making it easy to unlock a computing revolution.



Quantum logic reshaping the internet



At its core of invention, quantum computing goes beyond being just faster computers, but is uniquely designed to create an entirely different universe of processing. Instead of using bits (0s and 1s) as it’s applicable in AI, quantum computers use qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously through the principles of superposition and entanglement. By implication, a well and thoroughly designed quantum system can solve problems in microseconds, compared to classical computers, which could take years to solve the same and similar problems.



This could enable ultra-secure communication through what is known as quantum key distribution (QKD). Consequently, data interception would be made nearly impossible, which could reshape global connectivity, providing faster power and more secure digital infrastructures.



When AI meets quantum power



The concept of AI systems greatly depends on data input into the AI algorithm, which means the more data that is fed into the Algorithm, the better the output. Most AI systems are commonly faced with hardware limitations, and some of the largest AI systems, like ChatGPT and DeepMind’s AlphaFold, among others, are known to be confronted with these challenges. However, with quantum, these limitations are not present. This is because quantum machine learning (QML) is leveraged to perform tasks such as pattern recognition, optimisation and simulation. Additionally, with the concept of QML training, the need to train data in real time with massive data centres will no longer be necessary. In practical terms, the impact of quantum capacity and its application would be felt more than training billions of AI model parameters for minutes, as the expected output will now be achieved in microseconds. For instance, realizing global climate systems in real-time and simulating financial markets can now be achieved in real-time.



The darker side of quantum-AI synergy



As good as this collision is, a dark undercurrent could emerge, where these very brilliant technologies that promise to transform our way of doing things could also be weaponised by state actors or cybercriminals. The malicious attackers can utilize the combination of AI and quantum to actualize quantum-enhanced cyber threats. Researchers are also of the view of the possibilities that cybercriminals will be able to decrypt modern encryptions like elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), advanced encryption standard (AES) and Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA), among others.  For instance, RSA and ECC are practical encryption methods used in financial institutions to protect online transactions. When these are compromised, they render the confidentiality of scrambled data exposed, hence allowing unauthorized access to such information. The day that this happened is already tagged ‘Q-Day’, that is, when quantum computers become powerful enough to break today’s encryption standards. Additionally, other security breaches like password cracking, forging digital certificates or even deepfaking (that is, impersonating AI systems) are among others that can be triggered by cybercriminals with the advent of quantum and AI.  



Preparing for Q-Day: The cybersecurity paradox



As most systems now employ cryptographic keys to provide confidentiality to their data, Q-Day, the moment when quantum computers become powerful enough to break existing encryption, would render some of these efforts useless. So, organization and government institutions alike are bracing ahead of Q-Day since the internet, government databases, corporate organizations’ databases and even financial systems could easily be cracked. For instance, while the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has outlined a phased approach with a 2035 target set for complete migration across all systems, the US is mandating a similar transition for its National Security Systems by 2,030. These efforts are a proactive defence approach that focuses on developing quantum-resistant encryption models, ensuring the security of cryptographic keys and adaptive cybersecurity policies to withstand the coming quantum age.



Trust: The new currency of innovation



One of the challenges of quantum systems is that they operate based on probabilities, and not certainties. Similarly, the output of AI systems can easily be marred by inappropriate data quality, data bias, lack of explainability and transparency, adversarial threats, ethical concerns and governance concerns. The real battles that the developer of this innovation should concentrate on should not only revolve around their speed, efficiency or building the most potent combination of quantum and AI systems, but trust. Trust is essential as the ultimate expectation of any built system is to generate the expected outcome. Therefore, if AI represents intelligence, and quantum represents uncertainty, then ‘ How do we trust outcomes from systems we cannot fully explain?’



Therefore, trust would need to be built through cybersecurity frameworks and regulations to enhance security, transparency and governance. This would help in addressing the post-quantum cryptography, AI auditing, explainability and ethical oversight, which will form the foundation of resilient digital ecosystems.



The road ahead



Although AI and quantum computing will not replace human intelligence, their fingerprints will be seen all over the place in the not-too-distant future. While it is evident today that AI is already transforming the industries, the future holds that both AI and quantum will further provide innovations beyond what humans can imagine in various sectors such as energy, healthcare, finance and national defence, among others. However, the real question is whether society can adapt to the pace at which these technologies are moving before they control us.



Looking beyond innovation



It is now clear that the convergence of artificial intelligence and quantum computing not only provides technological breakthroughs but also cybersecurity challenges. Putting them together, computation, problem-solving and data analysis will be more effective and efficient at unimaginable scales. Despite positive capabilities, the tendency for them to be threatened and undermine the very foundations of digital trust and privacy that modern societies depend upon is very high. Therefore, as quantum computing is gradually coming up with Q-Day approaching, the urgency to prepare for a post-quantum world becomes increasingly clear.



Consequently, organizations, governments and cybersecurity experts should now start looking beyond innovation and the technological advancement that these technologies deliver and start focusing on resilience. This would involve a massive investment in advancing ethical AI governance, developing regulatory frameworks and regulations, and building post-quantum cryptographic standards in existing systems to maintain security and public confidence. Therefore, the race should not only be focused on developing advanced technologies, but also on creating secure technologies that are not easily prone to attacks by cybercriminals.

Apple's AirPods Pro 3 are back on sale for an all-time-low price,"If you haven&#39;t yet upgraded to Apple&#39;s AirPods Pro 3, you can pick up the company&#39;s latest model at a discount through a deal on Amazon right now. The AirPods Pro 3, which came out in September, are currently down from $249 to $220 — their Cyber Monday all-time low price. With the new AirPods Pro, Apple made some big improvements, including better battery life and sound quality, and introduced useful new features, such as Live Translation. 

  
The AirPods Pro 3 are the best AirPods available today, with Apple&#39;s H2 chip, and earned a score of 90 out of 100 in Engadget&#39;s review this fall. Active noise cancellation (ANC) is one of the biggest selling points of the AirPods Pro, and Apple has made the experience even better with the AirPods Pro 3. They sport new foam-infused ear tips that create a better seal to improve passive noise isolation, and as Engadget&#39;s Billy Steele wrote in his review, &#34;Ultra-low-noise microphones combine with advanced computational audio to silence even more background noise.&#34; In testing, they had no problem blocking out the chatter of people nearby or otherwise noisy environments. 
With the AirPods Pro 3, Apple introduced heart-rate sensing, so you&#39;ll be able to see your heart rate data from the earbuds in the Fitness app and other workout apps. The AirPods Pro 3 also boast Live Translation, which you can activate via controls on the earbuds themselves. As long as you have an Apple Intelligence-capable device, you&#39;ll be able to translate in-person conversations in English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish and Chinese (Mandarin). 
Also on sale in the world of AirPods are the AirPods 4 with ANC, which are down to $100 again — the same price we saw during Black Friday. You can even pick them up with AppleCare+ for $119.

"Adobe brings Photoshop, Acrobat and Adobe Express to ChatGPT","Back in October, OpenAI announced apps like Spotify and Canva would be accessible in ChatGPT. At the time, the company said more software was on the way, and now one of the most popular professional applications is available through the chatbot.    Starting today, you can access Photoshop, Acrobat and Adobe Express inside of ChatGPT. All the apps are free to use through OpenAI’s website, though before you can begin generating PDFs and illustrations using Acrobat and Adobe Express, you&#39;ll need to sign into your Adobe account. To use any of the apps in ChatGPT, either name them in your prompt or select them from the plus menu. Of the three apps, the way OpenAI&#39;s chatbot connects to Photoshop is probably the most interesting. Depending on the prompt, the interface will change to display the sliders most relevant to your request. For example, if you want to brighten an image, you&#39;ll see one slider allowing you to adjust the exposure, alongside other ones for the shadows and highlights. By comparison, if you want to add an effect to an image, ChatGPT might display options related to dithering and tri-tone, among others. What&#39;s interesting about all this is the way ChatGPT is interacting with Adobe&#39;s tools, through an MCP server, to offer a slice of the company&#39;s apps. I don&#39;t know about you, but I’ve always found Adobe software to be far too complicated, with often one too many ways to accomplish the same task. Granted, what I saw was a hands-off demo, but the routing Adobe created worked well. A ChatGPT user asks the chatbot to create a dance party invitation. Adobe&#34;We build the Lego blocks, which are the MCP tools, and we create detailed instructions, and then ChatGPT figures out what it wants to do,&#34; Aubrey Cattell, vice-president of developer platform and partner ecosystem at Adobe, explains. &#34;Sometimes it does what we want it, and sometimes it doesn&#39;t. That&#39;s the nature of it being non-deterministic, and we&#39;re continuing to hone as much as we can from users&#39; intent and natural language to give them the result that they&#39;re looking for.&#34;Of course, if you ever want more control, the web versions of Photoshop, Acrobat and Adobe Express are a click away.         For OpenAI, this is easily the biggest coup to date of its push to reshape ChatGPT into an operating system for all the apps its more than 800 million users depend on daily. For Adobe, it feels like the company is partnering with an entity out to eat its lunch. After all, OpenAI offers its own image generation. However, Cattell said Adobe doesn&#39;t see it that way. &#34;A couple weeks back, OpenAI dropped Apps SDK as a new paradigm for accessing ChatGPT, we saw there was a natural fit in the work we were doing with our applications,&#34; he said. &#34;Essentially, they gave us an operating system we were able to leverage to bring our applications to their surface. There&#39;s a lot of natural affinity there between the workflows OpenAI is trying to enable and Adobe&#39;s best in class capabilities.&#34;  Cattell promised Adobe would continue to explore what it could offer inside of ChatGPT, but added the company&#39;s apps will continue to be the place users can go if they want more power, precision and control.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/adobe-brings-photoshop-acrobat-and-adobe-express-to-chatgpt-130000389.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2FPS_Make_Colors_More_Vibrant_16x9.png&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=95a0f1690593d7ef7b6c40970b5e903494ce5bec,https://www.engadget.com/ai/adobe-brings-photoshop-acrobat-and-adobe-express-to-chatgpt-130000389.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-10T13:00:00Z,8,Tech

The best mesh Wi-Fi systems of 2025,"Spotty Wi-Fi can make even simple tasks feel harder than they should. If you’ve ever had a video call freeze in one room or watched a stream buffer in another, a mesh Wi-Fi system can fix those frustrations. Instead of relying on a single router tucked in a corner, a mesh setup uses multiple units that work together to spread a strong, consistent signal throughout your home.Modern mesh systems are built for busy households. They keep dozens of devices connected at once, manage traffic intelligently and often include helpful app features that make troubleshooting or adjusting settings much easier. Many support the latest Wi-Fi standards and faster internet plans too, so you can upgrade your network without replacing everything else.We’ve tested a range of mesh Wi-Fi systems to find the ones that deliver the best mix of speed, coverage and reliability. Whether you live in a small apartment or a multi-floor home, these picks can help you stay connected wherever you are.

What to look for in a mesh Wi-Fi system 
Linksys’ CEO Jonathan Bettino told Engadget why mesh systems are an “advancement in Wi-Fi technology” over buying a single point router. With one transmitter, the signal can degrade the further away from the router you go, or the local environment isn’t ideal. “You can have a small [home], but there’s thick walls [...] or things in the way that just interfere with your wireless signal,” he said. 
Historically, the solution to a home’s Wi-Fi dead zone was to buy a Wi-Fi extender but Bettino said the hardware has both a “terrible user experience” and one of the highest return rates of any consumer electronics product. Mesh Wi-Fi, by comparison, offers “multiple nodes that can be placed anywhere in your home,” says Bettino, resulting in “ubiquitous Wi-Fi” that feels as if you have a “router in every room.” 
Rather than having one main router in your home, having a “router in every room” is the biggest selling point for mesh Wi-Fi given how reliant we all are on the internet. Each node is in constant contact with each other, broadcasting a single, seamless network to all of your connected devices. There’s no separate network for the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands, just a single name that you connect to. 
It’s a good time to buy a mesh Wi-Fi system since the latest standard, Wi-Fi 6E, represents a big leap in the technology. Matt MacPherson, Cisco&#39;s Chief Technology Officer for Wireless, said Wi-Fi 6E is a big “inflection point,” using much more of the wireless spectrum than its predecessors. “If you’re using that spectrum with a Wi-Fi 6 [device],” he said, “you’re going to get significant gains [in speed.]” 
MacPherson added Wi-Fi 6E will likely “carry you for a long time” thanks to the fact its “top throughputs now typically exceed what people can actually connect their home to.” In short, with a top theoretical per-stream speed of 1.2 Gbps, Wi-Fi 6E is fast enough to outrun all but the fastest internet service. 
What do all these Wi-Fi numbers and letters mean? 
I’m sorry folks, we need to get boringly technical for one paragraph, but I promise you it’s worth it. 
Wi-Fi is governed by International Standard IEEE 802.11, and every few years a letter gets added onto that name when the technology evolves and improves. Until 2019, routers were sold under their IEEE name, leaving users to pick through the word soup of a product labeled 802.11 b/g/a/n/ac and so on. 
Mercifully, wiser heads opted to rebrand the letters as numbers, so rather than 802.11 b/g/a/n/ac, we have Wi-Fi 1, 2, 3 4 and 5. Right now, we’re in the middle of one of those Wi-Fi generations, with most of the gear on sale right now supporting either Wi-Fi 6 or Wi-Fi 6E. 
What’s the difference between Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 6E? 
Wi-Fi uses chunks of the radio frequency spectrum, with Wi-Fi 6 using the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands to pump data around. In fact, back in the old days, it was likely your home router would offer you the choice of the 2.4GHz or the 5GHz network, as separate bands to access. These days, all of the spectrums are tied together as one thing, and Wi-Fi 6E has the added ability to use the 6GHz band as well. That’s a big chunk of extra wireless real estate that isn’t as cluttered up as the 2.4 and 5GHz bands. 
You’re going to talk about wireless frequencies now, aren’t you. 
Each Wi-Fi band had tradeoffs, because the slower radio frequencies have greater range but less speed. 2.4GHz signals will travel a long way in your home but aren’t quick, while 6GHz is blisteringly fast but can be defeated by a sturdy brick wall. A lot of Wi-Fi-enabled gear you own, like smart home products, only use the 2.4GHz band because the range is better and it’s a lot cheaper. But it means that the band is also overcrowded and slow, making it great for your doorbell and robovac, but lackluster for Twitch streaming. 
So, what am I looking for? 
Right now, the market is full of mature Wi-Fi 6 and 6E devices, and most new systems available to buy are capable of taking advantage of the faster speeds they offer. This guide focuses on Wi-Fi 6E gear since it’s what we think it’s more than enough to satisfy almost everyone’s at-home Wi-Fi needs. 
What about Wi-Fi 7? 
We’re now seeing the first generation of Wi-Fi 7 devices available to buy, but we don’t recommend you do so immediately. The Wi-Fi 7 standard is still so new that there’s little to no reason for you to rush out and buy one for your home. The hardware is tremendously expensive and while Wi-Fi 7 will, eventually, offer some great benefits over 6E, it’s not as transformative an upgrade as 6E. Not to mention, Wi-Fi 7 is so new that almost none of your home’s devices will be able to take advantage of its big-ticket features. I’d estimate you won’t need to worry about upgrading to Wi-Fi 7 for at least five years, if not longer. 
Range and speed 
All Wi-Fi routers boast a theoretical broadcast range and a theoretical top speed, and in some cases external antennas to boost signal directionality — but these figures don’t mean much. After all, manufacturers can’t control your ISP’s real speed, the materials and layout of your home or where you put your Wi-Fi gear. Raw speed isn’t everything, either, and you likely need a lot less than the internet speeds your provider is advertising. What matters more is how consistent your connection is between rooms and across devices.. After all, Netflix needs just 15 Mbps to push a single 4K video stream to your home. As cool as it is to say you’ve got all these hundreds of Mbps, factors like latency and reliability are far more crucial to a happy internet life. And unless you have Gigabit internet that can reach speeds of up to 1 Gbps, you won’t need a mesh router that offers that spec. 
Backhaul 
Mesh Wi-Fi systems work by connecting every hardware node to a single wireless network, letting them all communicate with each other. Imagine four people in a busy, noisy restaurant all trying to order their dinner from a weary staff member, all at once. Now imagine, while this is going on, that four more people at that same table are also trying to tell a funny anecdote. It’s no surprise that it might take a long time for the right information to reach its intended destination. 
To combat this, higher-end mesh routers offer dedicated wireless backhaul; a slice of the spectrum for node-to-node communication. So rather than everyone talking at once in the same space, the conversations are essentially separated, reducing the invisible clutter in the air. Because there’s less confusing cross-chatter, everything moves faster, offering a significant performance boost to those systems. 
Connectivity 
These days, even your washing machine can have a wireless connection, but that doesn’t mean you should ignore the joys of wired internet. No matter how fast Wi-Fi is, a hard line will always be faster, and some gear, like Philips’ Hue bridge, still needs an ethernet connection. Plenty of routers can also use these hard connections as backhaul, eliminating further wireless clutter. 
It’s convenient for spread-out systems and power users, but it will mean running more wires through your home. The most common standard is Cat 5e, or gigabit ethernet which, unsurprisingly, has a top speed of 1 Gigabit per second (Gbps). Since Ethernet cables are backward compatible, you should be able to easily find one that works with your system. However, to get the most out of your mesh routers, it’s worth investing in an Ethernet cable that meets the standard your router uses — if it’s Cat 5e, use a Cat 5e cable. You can check your router’s specs via the manufacturer’s website to be sure. 
Flexibility and scalability 
Mesh routers enable you to add (or subtract) modules from your home network to suit your needs. D-Link’s Alan Jones said users should “check how scalable the prospective product is” before you buy. This sense of scale doesn’t just apply to the number of nodes on the network, but how many simultaneous connections it can handle. 
It’s also worth looking at ASUS’ AiMesh products, which can combine mesh Wi-Fi gear and its standard “spider” Wi-Fi routers. If you’ve got a tricky part of your home, you can bolt on an ultra-power standalone Wi-Fi router to a compatible mesh. 
Placement 
Mesh networks replace one big piece of hardware with a series of identical nodes that you scatter around your home. You connect one to your modem (usually over ethernet), and then scatter the rest around the place for the best coverage. A good rule of thumb is to place each node no more than two rooms away from the last one, rather than sticking them at the far ends of your home. 
Bear in mind, every physical obstacle between a Wi-Fi node, its siblings and your devices will hurt your overall performance. You should aim to place them, at the very least, at waist height on furniture in open air, without too many obstructions. The reason many mesh Wi-Fi products are designed to look like an inoffensive white doodad is so you don’t feel compelled to hide them behind your TV. 
Other mesh Wi-Fi router systems we tested 
Amazon Eero Pro 7 
Eero built its reputation on easy to use yet powerful mesh systems that offer a lot of good in a relatively small and affordable package. Setup is effortless, the app running things is clean and simple, and you get the added benefit of backwards compatibility with older hardware. Sadly, the issue with every Eero system is that so many basic management features, like parental controls, are paywalled behind the company’s Eero Plus subscription for $100 a year. 
Amazon Eero 6E 
Eero Pro 6E is an “easy” device, the sort a total novice can set up on their own and thrive with for years on end. There’s little brainwork required to get things set up, and the app has a clean UI with plenty of hand-holding. But, as with the Eero Pro 7, the fact that so many basic management tools are paywalled irks me, especially since you can get plenty of them for free with Google’s rival offering. 
Netgear Orbi 960 
The Orbi 96T0 (RBKE963) is Netgear’s flagship mesh Wi-Fi product, which the company calls the “world’s most powerful Wi-Fi 6E system.” It’s also one of the most expensive consumer-level kits on the market, setting you back $1,499.99 for a three pack. It&#39;s a fantastic piece of gear, but it&#39;s worth saying that the subset of people who could, would or should buy it remains far smaller than you might expect. Ultimately, I feel that if you’re paying luxury prices, you should expect a luxury product. There were plenty of times during testing that I went looking for a feature that was either only available via the web client, or behind a paywall. While, yes, much of your cash is going to the superlative hardware, but for this sort of money, the fact you have to pay extra for some table-stakes features is insulting. If you’re looking for a new Wi-Fi system and aren’t prepared to spend almost $1,500, it’s worth considering our other top picks for the best Wi-Fi routers and mesh systems. 
How we test Wi-Fi routers 
My home covers around 2,200 square feet across three stories with the office on the third floor. It’s relatively long and thin, with the living room at the front of the house, the kitchen at the back and the three bedrooms on the first floor. Its age means there are a lot of solid brick walls, old-school lathe and plaster as well as aluminum foil-backed insulation boards to help with energy efficiency. There are two major Wi-Fi dead zones in the house: The bathroom and the third bedroom behind it, since there’s lots of old and new pipework in the walls and floors. 
For mesh routers with two nodes, I place the first in my living room, connected via ethernet to my cable modem with the second on the first floor landing in the (ostensible) center of the house. For three-node sets, the third goes in my kitchen, which I’ve found is the optimal layout to get the bulk of my house covered in Wi-Fi. Fundamentally, my home poses enough challenges that if it succeeds here, it stands a very good chance of succeeding in your place. 
Each mesh is judged on ease of setup, Wi-Fi coverage, reliability, speed and any additional features that it advertises. I look at how user-friendly each companion app is from the perspective of a novice rather than an expert given you shouldn’t need to be a network engineer to do this sort of thing. Tests I do include checking for dead zones, moving from room to room to measure consistency of connectivity and streaming multiple videos at once to replicate common usage patterns. 
Mesh Wi-Fi system FAQs 
This is the section of our mesh Wi-Fi buyer’s guide where we talk about the stuff that most people just glide past. If you’re not familiar with technology, it can be intimidating if people talk about these things as if you’re expected to already know. So here’s a very simple, very basic rundown of some of the stuff you might have missed in very basic terms. 
What’s the difference between a Wi-Fi router and a mesh router? 
A Wi-Fi router is a box that usually sits close to wherever the internet comes into your home and pumps out information over radio waves. A mesh router, meanwhile, is a set of smaller devices, one of which sits next to your internet connection while the rest are scattered around your home. A single Wi-Fi router is great if your home is small, your needs aren’t too demanding, or if your home doesn’t have many radio-blocking obstructions that mean those signals can’t reach every corner of your home. But, much like standing next to a radio transmitter and then walking away from it in a straight line, after a while, the signal will degrade. 
That’s the problem a mesh system is designed to solve, since it will take the signal from your modem and pump to the other mesh devices, known as nodes, in your home. That way, instead of having one big router in one part of your home, you have several small ones that ensure you have good Wi-Fi connectivity all over. It also helps ensure that there’s no risk of dropping your connection as you move around — a mesh router system makes it easy to, for instance, walk from room to room watching Netflix and know you won’t miss a single frame. 
What&#39;s the difference between a Wi-Fi extender and a mesh system? 
Oh boy. Wi-Fi extenders, or repeaters, are small devices designed to push Wi-Fi a little further than your Wi-Fi router can stretch. They’re cheap, compact and often come in the form of little boxes that sit on your plug sockets with the hope of pushing Wi-Fi to a signal-sparse corner of your home. They are, and I can’t put this delicately enough, often a big pile of rubbish and are often not worth your time. Especially since the price of mesh routers has fallen to within most people’s budgets. 
What is a wireless backhaul? 
As we explained above, mesh Wi-Fi systems work by connecting every hardware node to a single wireless network, letting them all communicate with each other. Imagine four people in a busy, noisy restaurant all trying to order their dinner from a weary staff member, all at once. Now imagine, while this is going on, that four more people at that same table are also trying to tell a funny anecdote. It’s no surprise that it might take a long time for the right information to reach its intended destination. 
To combat this, higher-end mesh routers offer dedicated wireless backhaul; a slice of the spectrum for node-to-node communication. So rather than everyone talking at once in the same space, the conversations are essentially separated, reducing the invisible clutter in the air. Because there’s less confusing cross-chatter, everything moves faster, offering a significant performance boost to those systems. 
Is it better to hard wire instead of using a mesh Wi-Fi system? 
This is a great question that doesn’t have a simple answer. 
It is (almost) always preferable to connect devices with a wire, in this case Ethernet, than to use Wi-Fi. The speeds are faster, it’s more reliable and your data is less vulnerable to the slings and arrows of the laws of physics. Hell, I spent about a year trying to work out how to build an iPhone to Ethernet connector back in the bad old days of Wi-Fi. 
But your ability to do so depends on your level of DIY skills and / or how much money you want to spend on contractors. Wiring your home for Ethernet if you don’t have the infrastructure already can be a costly and time-consuming process. Particularly if you don’t want ugly wires running along your baseboards and under your carpets or across your hardwood floors. 
If you’re building your own home or can do some serious DIY, then hard wiring is a fantastic thing to have. It goes wonderfully hand-in-glove with mesh networks too, since you’ll be able to hook up your nodes to the network for even better speeds. 
But if I’m honest, advances in Wi-Fi technology mean I’d only go for hard wiring if I really believed I needed the sort of speed it offers. Unless you’re a Twitch streamer running your own 24/7 content studio, it’s probably overkill. 
When we started renovating our 140-year-old home, I had Ethernet installed in the living room, the master and second bedroom and in my office, all at the front of the house. I can’t use it for my mesh since I’d need to put the wiring through the middle of the house. If I ever had the wiring done again, I would do so as I know I’ll instantly see a meaningful improvement in both my connection speed and reliability. But I wouldn’t spend several thousand pounds to have it done just for the sake of it.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-mesh-wifi-system-130028701.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2024-12%2F0433c500-bd36-11ef-b3be-86e4065eaca1&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=0d19334079f28a89f2a7539a93b1031e18a3f1d5,https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-mesh-wifi-system-130028701.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-10T10:01:26Z,12,Tech

Polymorphic AI malware exists — but it’s not what you think,"
		
					  
						




We are either at the dawn of AI-driven malware that rewrites itself on the fly, or we are seeing vendors and threat actors exaggerate its capabilities. Recent Google and MIT Sloan reports reignited claims of autonomous attacks and polymorphic AI malware capable of evading defenders at machine speed. Headlines spread rapidly across security feeds, trade publications, and underground forums as vendors promoted AI-enhanced defenses.



Beneath the noise, the reality is far less dramatic. Yes, attackers are experimenting with LLMs. Yes, AI can aid malware development or produce superficial polymorphism. And yes, CISOs should pay attention. But the narrative that AI automatically produces sophisticated malware or fundamentally breaks defenses is misleading. The gap between AI’s theoretical potential and its practical utility remains large. For security leaders, the key is understanding realistic threats today, exaggerated vendor claims, and the near-future risks that deserve planning.



What even is polymorphic malware?



Polymorphic malware refers to malicious software that changes its code structure automatically while keeping the same core functionality. Its purpose is to evade signature-based detection by ensuring no two samples are identical at the binary level.



The concept is by no means new. Before AI, attackers used encryption, packing, junk code insertion, instruction reordering, and mutation engines to generate millions of variants from a single malware family. Modern endpoint platforms rely more on behavioral analysis than static signatures.



In practice, most so-called AI-driven polymorphism amounts to swapping a deterministic mutation engine for a probabilistic one powered by a large language model. In theory, this could introduce more variability. Realistically, though, it offers no clear advantage over existing techniques.



Marcus Hutchins, malware analyst and threat intelligence researcher, calls AI polymorphic malware “a really fun novelty research project,” but not something that offers attackers a decisive advantage. He notes that non-AI techniques are predictable, cheap, and reliable, whereas AI-based approaches require local models or third-party API access and can introduce operational risk. Hutchins also pointed to examples like Google’s “Thinking Robot” malware snippet, which queried the Gemini AI engine to generate code to evade antivirus. In reality, the snippet merely prompted AI to produce a small code fragment with no defined function or guarantee of working in an actual malware chain.



“It doesn’t specify what the code block should do, or how it’s going to evade an antivirus. It’s just working under the assumption that Gemini just instinctively knows how to evade antiviruses (it doesn’t). There’s also no entropy to ensure the ‘self-modifying’ code differs from previous versions, or any guardrails to ensure it actually works. The function was also commented out and not even in use,” Hutchens wrote in a post deleted from LinkedIn.



As the researcher observes, evasion alone is strategically meaningless unless it can reliably support a functioning malicious capability. Mature threat actors value reliability over novelty, and traditional polymorphism already meets that need.



What real advances is AI providing for attackers?



AI’s true impact today isn’t autonomous malware, but speed, scale, and accessibility when it comes to generating malicious payloads. Think of large language models serving as development assistants: debugging code, translating samples between languages, rewriting and optimizing scripts, and generating boilerplate loaders or stagers. This lowers technical barriers for less experienced actors and shortens iteration cycles for skilled ones.



Social engineering has also improved. Phishing campaigns are cleaner, more convincing, and highly scalable. AI rapidly generates region-specific lures, industry-appropriate pretexts, and polished messages, removing the grammatical red flags that defenders once relied on. Business email compromise attacks that already depend on deception rather than technical sophistication particularly benefit from this shift.



Generative AI tools can produce superficial variations in malware code by renaming variables or slightly rearranging structures. This occasionally bypasses basic static scanning, but rarely defeats modern behavioral detection, and often introduces instability that is unacceptable for well-resourced criminal operations. For established threat actor groups that require uptime and dependable performance, this unpredictability becomes a disadvantage.



The net effect isn’t improved sophistication, but a rise in accessibility: more actors, even inexperienced ones, can now produce “good enough” malware.



Earlier this year, a crude ransomware strain appeared in the Visual Studio marketplace as a test extension. John Tuckner of Secure Annex dubbed it “AI slop” ransomware that was poorly written, unstable, and operationally unadvanced. The sample highlighted how easily AI-assisted code can be bundled and distributed, not its ingenuity.



“Ransomware has appeared in the VS Marketplace and makes me worry,” Tuckner posted on X. “Clearly created through AI, it makes many mistakes like including decryption tools in extension. If this makes it into the marketplace through [sic], what impact would anything more sophisticated cause?”



Inflated AI claims draw industry pushback



The gap between marketing-driven AI narratives and practitioner skepticism is clear. A recent Anthropic report claimed a “highly sophisticated AI-led espionage campaign” targeting technology companies and government agencies. While some viewed this as proof that generative AI is embedded in nation-state cyber operations, experts were skeptical.



Veteran security researcher Kevin Beaumont criticized the report for lacking operational substance and providing no new indicators of compromise. BBC cyber correspondent Joe Tidy noted that activity likely reflected familiar campaigns, not a new AI-driven threat. Another researcher, Daniel Card emphasized that AI accelerates workflows but does not think, reason, or innovate autonomously.



Across these discussions, one pattern remains consistent: AI hype collapses under technical scrutiny.



Why AI polymorphic malware hasn’t taken over



If AI can accelerate development and generate endless variations of code, why has genuinely effective AI polymorphic malware not become commonplace? The reasons are practical rather than philosophical.




Traditional polymorphism works well: Commodity packers and crypters generate huge variant volumes cheaply and predictably. Operators see little benefit in switching to probabilistic AI generation that may break functionality.



Behavioral detection reduces benefits: Even if binaries differ, malware must still perform malicious actions (e.g. C2 communication, privilege escalation, credential theft, and lateral movement) which produce telemetry independent of code structure. Modern EDR, NDR, and XDR platforms detect this behavior reliably.



AI reliability issues: Large language models hallucinate, misuse libraries, or implement cryptography incorrectly. Code may appear plausible but fail under real-world conditions. As stated earlier, for criminal groups, instability is a serious operational risk.



Infrastructure exposure: Local models can leave forensic traces and third-party APIs risk abuse detection and logging. These risks further deter disciplined threat actors.




Most successful adversaries may still use AI for support tasks like research, phishing, translation, automation but not completely trust it with generating core payloads for their offensive operations.



What CISOs and defenders should watch out for



The real danger isn’t underestimating AI but misunderstanding its risk. Autonomous self-rewriting malware isn’t the immediate threat. Instead, attackers operate faster and at greater scale:




Automation and propagation. Recurrent malware campaigns like Shai-Hulud illustrate how attackers can use automation to dramatically increase efficiency, blast radius and the extent of disruption, without introducing novel technical logic. (This recurring campaign used automation, not necessarily AI). In later iterations, automated propagation spread the malware rapidly across environments and downstream dependencies, even though the payloads remained identical. This meant defenders could still rely on stable indicators such as hashes, static exfiltration URLs, and YARA rules, but they had far less time to react before impact cascaded across registries, build systems, and developer environments. The risk shift was not smarter malware, but faster, wider execution at machine speed.



Rapid variant iterations. Building on the previous point, AI can shorten the time between concept and deployment. Malware families can cycle during a single incident, increasing the value of behavioral detection, memory analysis, and retroactive hunting.



Social engineering at scale. AI-generated phishing, pretexting, and tailored messages improve quality and reach. Identity infrastructure (credentials, MFA, access workflows) remains a key attack surface. Defenders should focus on email security, user behavior analytics, and authentication resilience.



Volume and noise. More actors can produce “good enough” malware, raising the number of low-quality but operationally usable threats. Automation and prioritization in SOC operations are becoming even more essential to prevent response teams from being overwhelmed with noise and burnout.



Vendor skepticism. Marketing claims of AI-specific protection don’t guarantee superior detection. CISOs should demand transparent testing, real-world datasets, validated false-positive rates, and proof that protections promised by “novel” products extend beyond lab conditions.




AI is reshaping cybercrime, but not in the cinematic way some vendors suggest. Its impact lies in speed, scale, and accessibility rather than self-modifying malware that breaks existing defenses. Mature threat actors still rely on proven techniques. Polymorphism isn’t new, behavioral detection remains effective, and identity remains the primary entry point for attackers. Today’s “AI malware” is better understood as AI-assisted development rather than autonomous innovation.



For CISOs, the key takeaway is a compression of time and effort for attackers. The advantage shifts to those who can automate, iterate faster, and maintain visibility and control. Preparing for this reality means doubling down on behavioral monitoring, identity security, and response automation.



Right now, speculative self-aware malware is less of a risk than the real-world efficiency gains AI provides to attackers: faster campaign tempo, greater scale, and a lower barrier to entry for capable abuse. The hype is louder, but the operational impact of that acceleration is where leadership judgment now matters most.

Key cybersecurity takeaways from the 2026 NDAA,"
		
					  
						




On Dec. 7, the House and Senate Homeland Security Committees released their compromise version of the 2026 National Defense and Authorization Act (NDAA), a nearly 3,100-page piece of legislation that contains a host of provisions to fund several Department of Defense cybersecurity efforts in fiscal year 2026.



Although cybersecurity is referenced hundreds of times across the NDAA, the legislation contains provisions that, once the law becomes effective, will mark significant shifts in how the US military manages major cybersecurity tasks, particularly in the timely arena of protecting mobile communications of top brass and AI deployments, as well as more understated, but potentially high-impact, infosec duties.



Although numbers chronically vary widely for NDAA cyber expenses, depending on the source or the year, according to a July budget request from the CFO for the Defense Department, the cyber activities in the NDAA request for FY2026 are approximately $15.1 billion, or 4.1% more than the previous year’s request. This cyber budget bump stands in stark contrast to proposed double-digit cuts for civilian agencies.



Around $9.1 billion of that amount goes to pure cybersecurity efforts, with the rest allocated to not clearly defined “cyberspace operations” of US Cyber Command, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, the National Security Agency, and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering.



Around $611.9 million of the total was allocated to DoD cyber research for the “deployment and modernization of existing capabilities and technologies that advance next generation cybersecurity and cyberspace operations programs.”



Securing mobile phones for top officials



Few cyber risks are as operationally consequential as insecure mobile communications, and the NDAA directly targets this gap with new mandates for how the Pentagon procures and protects devices for top officials.



The bill requires that, no later than 90 days after enactment, the DoD will ensure that each wireless mobile phone and all related telecommunications the department provides to senior military officials or any other employee who performs sensitive national security functions are acquired under contracts or other agreements that require enhanced cybersecurity protections.



Under the bill, enhanced cybersecurity protections mean encrypted data, capabilities to mitigate or obfuscate persistent device identifiers, including periodic rotation of network or hardware identifiers to reduce the risk of inappropriate tracking of the activity or location of the wireless mobile phones, and the capability to monitor the wireless mobile phones continuously.



Under the legislation, 180 days after the bill’s enactment, the Secretary of Defense must submit to the relevant congressional defense committees a report detailing the mobile telecommunications contracts the Pentagon has entered pursuant to these provisions, how it determined which employees these mobile provisions apply to, and the total costs of wireless mobile phones and telecommunication services involved.



It is likely no coincidence that these provisions follow the so-called Signalgate incidents from earlier this year. During those incidents, the current DoD head Pete Hegseth shared over Signal via his private mobile device “nonpublic” information that identified “the quantity and strike times of manned US aircraft over hostile territory over an unapproved, unsecure network approximately two to four hours before the execution of those strikes,” according to a report released on Dec. 2 by the department’s inspector general.



AI and machine learning security and procurement requirements



Recognizing that AI now underpins everything from battlefield planning to intelligence analysis, the bill introduces sweeping requirements to safeguard these systems from emerging digital threats.



The NDAA spells out a spate of policy and procurement practices that the military should meet regarding artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML). First, the DoD, in consultation with other Federal agencies, has 180 days after the date of enactment to develop and implement a department-wide policy for the cybersecurity and associated governance of AI and ML systems and applications, as well as the models for AI and ML used in national defense applications.



The policy must protect against security threats to AI and machine learning, including model serialization attacks, model tampering, data leakage, adversarial prompt injection, model extraction, model jailbreaks, and supply chain attacks. It also must employ cybersecurity measures throughout the life cycle of systems using artificial intelligence or machine learning.



Moreover, the policy must reflect the adoption of industry-recognized frameworks to guide the development and implementation of AI and ML security best practices. Likewise, it must follow standards for governance, testing, auditing, and monitoring of systems using artificial intelligence and machine learning to ensure the integrity and resilience of such systems against corruption and unauthorized manipulation.



Finally, the AI and machine learning policy must accommodate training requirements for the department’s workforce to ensure personnel are prepared to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities specific to AI and ML.



The bill further spells out physical and cybersecurity procurement requirements for AI and machine learning systems. It specifies that the defense secretary must develop a framework for the implementation of cybersecurity and physical security standards and best practices relating to AI and ML technologies to mitigate risks to the department from the use of such technologies.



The NDAA specifies that the framework must cover all relevant aspects of the security of AI and ML systems, including the risk posed to and by the DoD workforce, including insider threat risks, training and workforce development requirements regarding artificial intelligence security awareness, artificial intelligence-specific threats and vulnerabilities, professional development and education, supply chain threats (including counterfeits), tampering risks, unintended exposure or theft of AI systems or data, security management practices and more.



It also requires the framework to draw on existing frameworks, including the NIST Special Publication 800 series and existing DoD frameworks, including the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification framework.



Finally, under the legislation, the framework must prioritize the most highly capable AI systems that may be of highest interest to cyber threat actors, based on risk assessments and threat reporting, and impose requirements for security on contractors.



Other AI provisions under the NDAA require the DoD to revise the mandatory training on cybersecurity for members of the Armed Forces and civilian employees of the department to include content related to the unique cybersecurity challenges posed by artificial intelligence.



The bill further says that by April 1, 2026, the DoD needs to establish a task force on AI sandbox environments to identify, coordinate, and advance department-wide efforts to develop and deploy AI sandbox environments necessary to support experimentation, training, familiarization, and development across the military.



Other noteworthy cyber-related NDAA provisions



Beyond mobile security and AI governance, the NDAA includes a broad array of cyber measures with strategic implications across defense, intelligence, and international partnerships.



The following are among the more noteworthy cybersecurity provisions in the compromise bill:



Commercial spyware: The bill contains a “sense of Congress” statement that there is a national security need for the legitimate and responsible procurement and application of cyber intrusion capabilities, including efforts related to counterterrorism, counternarcotics, and countertrafficking. It expresses the view that the proliferation of commercial spyware presents significant and growing risks to national security, including to the safety and security of government personnel.



It suggests that the US should oppose the misuse of commercial spyware “to target individuals, including journalists, defenders of internationally recognized human rights, and members of civil society groups, members of ethnic or religious minority groups, and others for exercising their internationally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms, or the family members of these targeted individuals.”



It also further stipulates that the US should coordinate with allies and partners to prevent the export of commercial spyware tools to end-users likely to use them for malicious activities, and to share information on this issue with allies robustly.



Evaluation of national security risks posed by foreign adversary acquisition of American multiomic data: The bill stipulates that not later than 270 days after its enactment, the director of national intelligence, in consultation with the secretary of defense, the US attorney general the secretary of health and humans services, the secretary of commerce, the secretary of homeland security, the secretary of state, and the national cyber director, shall complete an assessment of risks to national security posed by human multiomic data from US citizens that is collected or stored by a foreign adversary from the provision of biotechnology equipment or services. Multiomic data combines different types of biological data, such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, to provide a complete picture of a biological system.



Biological data for artificial intelligence: The legislation calls for tiered levels of cybersecurity safeguards and access controls for the storage of biological data and contains requirements for the protection of the privacy of individuals.



Cybersecurity regulatory harmonization: By June 1, 2026, the DoD must harmonize the cybersecurity requirements applicable to the defense industrial base, reduce the number of such requirements that are unique to a specific contract or other agreement, and submit to the congressional defense committees a report on the actions taken to carry out the harmonization.



Cybersecurity and resilience annex in Strategic Rail Corridor Network assessments: The legislation says the defense secretary, in coordination with the transportation secretary and the homeland security secretary, should conduct a periodic evaluation of the Strategic Rail Corridor Network. The assessment must include an annex containing a review of the cybersecurity and the resilience of the physical infrastructure of the Strategic Rail Corridor. The Strategic Rail Corridor is the interconnected network of rail corridors important to national defense and military mobility, as defined by the Department of Defense and the Federal Railroad Administration.



Cyber workforce recruitment and retention: The billrequires the defense secretary to fix the rates of basic pay for military employees working on cyber with a pay rate on par with comparable employees elsewhere in the government.



Supporting cybersecurity and cyber resilience in the Western Balkans: The NDAA contains a “sense of Congress” statement that the United States support for cybersecurity, cyber resilience, and secure ICT infrastructure in Western Balkans countries will strengthen the region’s ability to defend itself from and respond to malicious cyber activity conducted by nonstate and foreign actors, including foreign governments, that seek to influence the region.



Demonstration of real-time monitoring capabilities to enhance weapon system platforms: If funds are available, the secretary of defense, in coordinationwith the undersecretary of defense for acquisition andsustainment and the service acquisition executives, will carry out a demonstration to equip selected weapon systemplatforms with onboard, near real-time, end-to-end serialbus and radio frequency monitoring capabilities to detectcyber threats and improve maintenance efficiency.

GitHub Action Secrets aren’t secret anymore: exposed PATs now a direct path into cloud environments,"
		
					  
						




Many enterprises use GitHub Action Secrets to store and protect sensitive information such as credentials, API keys, and tokens used in CI/CD workflows. These private repositories are widely assumed to be safe and locked down.



But attackers are now exploiting that blind trust, according to new research from the Wiz Customer Incident Response Team. They found that threat actors are using exposed GitHub Personal Access Tokens (PATs) to access GitHub Action Secrets and sneak into cloud environments, then run amok.



“The root cause issue is the presence of these secrets in repos,” said David Shipley of Beauceron Security. “Cloud service provider access keys are gold, they can be extraordinarily long lived, and that’s what [attackers are] sniffing around for.”



GitHub Action Secrets aren’t secrets anymore



Wiz estimates that 73% of organizations using private GitHub Action Secrets repositories store cloud service provider (CSP) credentials within them. When PATs, which allow developers and automation bots to interact with GitHub repositories and workflows, are exploited, attackers can easily move laterally to CSP control planes.



PATs can become a “powerful springboard” that allows attackers to impersonate developers and carry out a range of activities, explained Erik Avakian, technical counselor at Info-Tech Research Group. It’s like having a backstage pass into a company’s cloud environments, he said.



“Once they’re holding that valid PAT, they can do all sorts of things in GitHub that lead directly back into a company’s AWS, Azure, GCP, or other types of cloud services, because GitHub treats that PAT like the real developer,” he said.



With that access, threat actors can “poke around” various repositories and workflows and look for anything that hints at cloud access, configuration items, scripts, and hidden secrets, he noted. If they get access to real cloud credentials, they “have the keys to the company’s AWS bucket, Azure subscriptions, and other workflows.”



They can then spin up cloud resources, access databases, steal source code, install malicious files such as crypto miners, sneak in malicious workflows, or even pivot to other cloud services, while setting up persistence mechanisms so they can return whenever they want.



“At that point, basically anything you can do in the cloud, so can they,” said Avakian.



Easily evading detection



Wiz found that a threat actor with basic read permissions via a PAT can use GitHub’s API code search to discover secret names embedded directly in a workflow’s yaml code, accessed via “${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}.”



The danger is that this secret discovery method is difficult to monitor because search API calls are not logged. Further, GitHub-hosted Actions run from GitHub-managed resources that use legitimate, shared IP addresses not flagged as malicious. Attackers can abuse secrets, impersonate workflow origins to exploit trust, and potentially access other resources if code is misconfigured or reused elsewhere in the workflows. They can also persistently access the system.



In addition, if the exploited PAT has write permissions, attackers can execute malicious code and remove workflow logs and runs, pull requests, and ‘created branches’ (isolated copies of codebases for dev experimentation). Because workflow logs are rarely streamed into security incident and event management (SIEM) platforms, attackers can easily evade detection.



Also, notably, a developer’s PAT with access to a GitHub organization makes private repositories vulnerable; Wiz research found that 45% of organizations have plain-text cloud keys stored privately, while only 8% are in public repositories.



Shipley noted: “In some developers’ minds, a private repo equals safe, but it’s clearly not safe.”



How enterprise leaders can respond



To protect themselves against these threats, enterprises should treat PATs as they would any other privileged credentials, Avakian noted. Cloud infrastructure and cloud development environments should be properly locked down, essentially “zero trustifying” them through micro segmentation and privileged user management to contain them and prevent lateral pivoting.



“Like any other credentials, tokens are best secured when they have reasonable expiration dates,” said Avakian. “Making tokens expire, rotating them, and using short-lived credentials will help thwart these types of risks.”



Least privilege everything and give accounts only the rights they need, rather than an ‘admin everything’ approach, Avakian advised. More importantly, move cloud secrets out of GitHub workflows and ensure that the proper amount of monitoring and log review processes are in place to flag surprise or unexpected workflow or cloud creation events.



Beauceron’s Shipley agreed, saying that enterprises need a multi-pronged strategy, good monitoring, instant response plans, and developer training processes that are reinforced with “meaningful consequences” for non-compliance. Developers must be motivated to follow secure coding best practices; building a strong security culture in developer teams is huge. “You can’t buy a blinky box for that part of the problem,” he said.



“Criminals have stepped up their game,” said Shipley. “Organizations don’t have a choice. They have to invest in these areas, or they will pay.”



Also, stop blindly trusting GitHub repos, he added. “The nature of repos is that they live forever. If you don’t know if you have cloud secrets inside your repos, you need to go and find them. If they’re there, you need to change them yesterday, and you need to stop adding new ones.”



If there is an upside, he noted, it’s that enterprises are “victims of their own success” as they’ve raised the bar with multi-factor authentication (MFA). Gains in general security awareness makes it more difficult for criminals to obtain access and identities and compromise systems.



“In some ways, this is a good sign,” said Shipley. “In a hilarious kind of way, it means [the criminals] are now moving into deeper levels requiring more effort.”

December Patch Tuesday: Windows Cloud Files Mini Filter Driver hole already being exploited,"
		
					  
						




Microsoft is finishing 2025 by issuing only 57 patches for Windows and other products for December Patch Tuesday, but one vulnerability is already being exploited as a zero day and needs to be addressed fast.



It’s an escalation of privilege vulnerability in Windows Cloud Files Mini Filter Driver (CVE-2025-62221), described as a use-after-free problem in which a program tries to use a block of memory that has already been returned to system control. The attack complexity is low. The worst case scenario is that a threat actor could leverage it to escalate access privileges.



“Elevation of privilege bugs turn a foothold into a full breach,” Satnam Narang, senior staff research engineer at Tenable, said in an email, “as attackers often use them to conduct post-compromise activity after they have gained initial access through other means, such as social engineering or exploitation of another flaw.



“Windows Cloud Files Mini Filter Driver is an attractive target because it is a file system driver that enables cloud applications to access file system functionalities,” he added.



 Jack Bicer, director of vulnerability research at Action1, said patching this vulnerability is “the most urgent concern” because it is actively being exploited by any attacker who can get any level of local access.



“Active exploitation means real incidents are already occurring,” he pointed out. “This vulnerability is likely to be combined with phishing, browser-based attacks, malicious documents, or other initial footholds to achieve full system takeover. The attack potential includes disabling security tooling, accessing sensitive information, moving laterally across the organization’s network, and establishing persistent high-privilege access. Because the impacted driver is widely deployed across enterprise environments, the exposure is broad and the potential operational consequences significant.”



IT executives should ensure operational teams allocate resources to accelerated patching, enforce least-privilege access controls, and strengthen monitoring for anomalous activity across systems that cannot be patched immediately, he stressed. “A focused, time-bound remediation plan, beginning with actively exploited and RCE vulnerabilities, will provide the greatest reduction in organizational risk and the strongest defense against potential widespread compromise,” he said.



Unfortunately, said Kevin Breen, senior director of cyber threat research at Immersive, Microsoft has not provided any details on how this exploit is being abused or provided any indicators of compromise, making it harder for defenders to start proactive threat hunting. 



Holes in Exchange Server



Michael Walters, president of Action1, drew attention to two vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Server:




CVE-2025-64666, an escalation of privilege (EoP) hole allowed by improper input validation;



CVE-2025-64667, which allows a threat actor to spoof over a network.




While rated Important and assessed as exploitation Less/Unlikely, Walters notes that these flaws affect core messaging and identity surfaces, and can become critical when chained, such as by spoofing enabling phishing, or EoP facilitating mailbox theft.



Tyler Reguly, associate director of R&amp;D at Fortra, said CSOs should assign priority to two other vulnerabilities that Microsoft rated as critical this month.




CVE-2025-62557, a use after free vulnerability in Microsoft Office that allows an unauthorized attacker to execute code locally; 



CVE-2025-62554, described as an access of resource using incompatible type (‘type confusion’) hole in Microsoft Office that allows an unauthorized attacker to execute code locally. 




Because these list the Outlook Preview Pane as an attack vector, they worry Reguly. “I always find that one of the scariest attack vectors that can be listed,” he said. “Vulnerabilities that don’t rely on user interaction are vulnerabilities that we want to pay attention to.”



Copilot hole for those using JetBrains



Breen of Immersive also said organizations using GitHub Copilot for the JetBrains application development platform should patch a hole in Copilot promptly, before threat actors find a way to exploit it. 



The vulnerability report states that it’s possible to gain the ability for code execution on affected hosts by tricking the LLM into running commands that bypass the guardrails and appending instructions to the user’s “auto-approve” settings, Breen notes. This can be achieved through a Cross Prompt Injection, he said, where the prompt is modified, not by the user, but by the LLM agents as they craft their own prompts based on the content of files or data retrieved from a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. 



Although Microsoft has marked this exploitation as Less Likely, Breen said, CSOs taking a risk-based approach should note that developers typically have access to API keys and secrets that could enable a large attack surface for attackers.  



SAP vulnerabilities



Separately, SAP’s Security Notes for December include four HotNews Notes, two of which are given CVSS scores in the 9s:




note #3685270 [CVE-2025-42880] patches a code injection vulnerability in SAP Solution Manager. According to researchers at Onapsis, a remote-enabled function module could allow an authenticated attacker to inject arbitrary code, leading to a high impact on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system. The vulnerability is patched by adding appropriate input sanitization to the affected function module. Given the central role of SAP Solution Manager in the SAP system landscape, Onapsis strongly recommends that this be patched quickly;



note #3685286, [CVE-2025-42928], was issued after Onapsis was able to exploit a deserialization vulnerability in the SAP jConnect SDK for Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise (ASE) to launch remote code execution by providing specially crafted input to the component. “A successful exploit requires high privileges, preventing the vulnerability from being tagged with a CVSS score of 10.0,” Onapsis said;



note #3683579 affects SAP Commerce Cloud customers. SAP Commerce Cloud uses a version of Apache Tomcat that is vulnerable to CVE-2025-55754 and CVE-2025-55752. This security note, with a CVSS score of 9.6, provides fixes that include a patched version of Apache Tomcat. If  unpatched, these flaws put the application’s confidentiality, integrity and availability at high risk, says Onapsis.



note #3668705, tagged with a CVSS score of 9.9, was initially released on SAP’s November Patch Day and patches a Code Injection vulnerability in SAP Solution Manager. This note was updated with additional correction instructions. 




Advice for 2026



Finally, with this last batch of patches for the year from Microsoft, Fortra’s Tyler Reguly provided some context.



“In 2025, Microsoft patched 1275 vulnerabilities,” he said in an email. “Which should mean roughly 106 vulnerabilities each month, yet December only saw 70 vulnerabilities when you include the third-party CNA vulnerabilities. If all things were equal, December should account for 8.3 % of all CVEs fixed by Microsoft. Instead December only contains 5.5% of this year’s total CVEs. I suppose we can thank Microsoft for an early Christmas gift.”



“If I were in charge of all aspects of security for an enterprise, as we wrap up the year and think about 2026 budgets,” he added, “I’d probably be thinking about the two critical Office vulnerabilities that impact the Preview Pane and consider the email protections that I have in place and where I can make investments in 2026 to further improve the email security of my organization. Between ‘silent attacks’ that utilize the preview pane, phishing, and all the other risks that come to us via email, it is one of the places where organizations can still do more to shore up their security posture and put themselves in a good place.”

Uber is installing kiosks for booking rides without the mobile app,"Uber is rolling out kiosks for travelers to book rideshares without using the mobile app. The company is pitching the service as a convenience for international travelers who may not have a data plan, but it could also be a lifesaver if your phone runs out of juice and you don&#39;t have a way to recharge it. A passenger can use the kiosk to enter their destination and desired ride type, then will receive a printed receipt with the details about their booked ride. The first kiosk will debut in Terminal C at LaGuardia Airport in New York City, but Uber said it would have additional locations in airports, hotels and ports over the coming months. In airport situations, these kiosks make Uber even more of a direct competitor to traditional taxis. With the removal of the app, the kiosk can essentially stand is as the dispatcher and a passenger can decide how to travel based on their preferences (or on wait times) for a rideshare versus a yellow cab.Uber also used LaGuardia as the starting point for its shuttle bus service in New York, with $18 rides between the airport and Manhattan transit hubs in October 2024; it later rolled out the shuttles to John F. Kennedy Airport in March 2025. Today, Uber said it is bringing the shuttle bus option to Newark Liberty International Airport, so all major NYC airports now have access to the service.

Slack's CEO is joining OpenAI to find the money to pay for all those data centers,"OpenAI has announced that Denise Dresser, the current CEO of Slack, will be the company&#39;s new Chief Revenue Officer. Dresser will oversee the company&#39;s revenue strategy &#34;across enterprise and customer success,&#34; according to OpenAI&#39;s announcement, and will presumably play a key role in leading the company towards profitability now that it&#39;s reorganized as a public benefit corporation.&#34;We&#39;re on a path to put AI tools into the hands of millions of workers, across every industry,&#34; Fidji Simo, OpenAI&#39;s CEO of Products said in the announcement. &#34;Denise has led that kind of shift before, and her experience will help us make AI useful, reliable, and accessible for businesses everywhere.&#34;Simo joined OpenAI in May of this year, after serving as CEO of Instacart, and before that, the head of Facebook at Meta. Hiring Simo and Dresser could be a good indication of how OpenAI plans to approach ChatGPT going forward. Which is to say, the company is taking a very Silicon Valley approach to growing its chatbot business and focusing on scale and monetizing as many AI interactions as possible. It&#39;s not a mistake that Simo helped establish Meta&#39;s ads business and OpenAI is reportedly planning to introduce ads into chats with its AI models.Even with the possibility of ad revenue, Dresser will still have to overcome what OpenAI continues to spend to offer its various AI products. OpenAI pays for multiple partnerships for data center access and has commitments to both buy and build server components for those data centers. Add in the cost of just processing a ChatGPT query itself, and growing the company’s revenue seems like a tall order.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/slacks-ceo-is-joining-openai-to-find-the-money-to-pay-for-all-those-data-centers-220411962.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2F2025-12%2F00e0958a-fa89-4b89-bfcf-131b29fcaa18&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=c27646649910b352ffaf577f02cb55cdc4469620,https://www.engadget.com/ai/slacks-ceo-is-joining-openai-to-find-the-money-to-pay-for-all-those-data-centers-220411962.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-09T22:04:11Z,7,Tech
Instagram is generating SEO-bait headlines for its users' posts,"It looks like Meta has decided to turn Instagram users into unwitting SEO spam pawns. On Tuesday, 404 Media reported that the platform is generating sensational, likely AI-generated headlines for user posts without their knowledge or explicit consent. An Engadget editor has also noticed this on their posts. The headlines are found in the pages’ code and are only visible in search results.The scheme appears to be an effort to boost the Google search ranking of Instagram content. For example, author Jeff VanderMeer&#39;s untitled video about a bunny eating a banana received a generic, SEO-style title. &#34;Meet the Bunny Who Loves Eating Bananas, A Nutritious Snack For Your Pet,&#34; it reads. That indeed reads like the work of an LLM.In another example, a Massachusetts library&#39;s post promoting a reading of a VanderMeer book got the same treatment. &#34;Join Jeff VanderMeer on a Thrilling Beachside Adventure with Mesta …&#34;, the headline reads.Multiple cosplayers also found their posts gaining strange titles. &#34;I would not write mediocre text like that, and it sounds as if it was auto-generated at scale with an LLM,&#34; cosplayer Brian Dang told 404 Media. &#34;This becomes problematic when the headline or description advertises someone in a way that is not how they would personally describe themselves.&#34;The headlines appear in the posts’ code, as confirmed by Google&#39;s Rich Result Test tool. (They&#39;re found in the &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt; tags for the post.) The spammy headlines differ from the page&#39;s alt text, which Instagram generates for people with low vision.You might want to search for your recent content to see if you’re affected. Engadget reached out to Meta for confirmation. We&#39;ll update this story if we hear back.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/instagram-is-generating-seo-bait-headlines-for-its-users-posts-213702800.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2F2025-12%2F650b614b-7119-4db6-8622-c43259ba9f69&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=be22362ba316f8bd0fdf7cea05df2f160d15af16,https://www.engadget.com/social-media/instagram-is-generating-seo-bait-headlines-for-its-users-posts-213702800.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-09T21:37:02Z,8,Tech

How to watch The Game Awards 2025 on December 11,"The Game Awards are this week, with the grand showcase for 2025 coming up on Thursday, December 11 at 8PM ET. There&#39;s also a pre-show (in case the multi-hour affair just isn&#39;t enough TGA for you) and that kicks off at 7:30PM ET. The ceremony will be a mix of honoring games from the past year and debuting trailers for future releases, so expect a couple interesting announcements to emerge from Thursday night. Engadget will be reporting on any big stories as they happen at The Game Awards, but if you want to watch along with us, the whole shebang is available to watch for free on just about every streaming platform you could want. The primo spot to watch is probably YouTube, since it will be broadcasting the show in 4K and you&#39;ll want to see all those trailers in their full glory. The video is embedded above. The other official co-streaming partners are Twitch and TikTok Live, but you can also watch everything on Steam and Amazon Prime Video. The Game Awards will also be on social media via Facebook Live, Instagram and X. It&#39;s been a good year for gaming and lots of top-notch projects are up for nominations at the show this year. The Game Awards will also shine a light on important subjects such as Innovation in Accessibility and Games For Impact as well as recognizing recent releases for excellence in artistry and design. And don&#39;t sleep on the Day of the Devs showcase happening tomorrow, Wednesday, December 10; that will almost certainly have some hype stuff emerging from the indie scene.In terms of reveals, host Geoff Keighley has shared a few looks at what&#39;s to come. There will definitely be an appearance by Lara Croft and whatever is happening at Wildflower Interactive, the new studio helmed by The Last of Us co-director Bruce Straley, is due to be announced. PlayStation will also have more to say about Saros, which is Housemarque&#39;s follow-up to Returnal. And of course, hope springs eternal (as do the memes) for Half-Life 3.

Traeger debuts Woodridge Pro Plus grill with Wi-Fi features and built-in storage cabinet,"Traeger debuted its Woodridge line of Wi-Fi-enabled pellet grills back in January. The overall theme across the Woodridge, Woodridge Pro and Woodridge Elite is the company’s reliable performance and features are available for less than the cost of its most premium models. Just before Christmas, the company is adding to the the Woodridge lineup with the Woodridge Pro Plus. 
For $400 more than the Woodridge Pro, this Plus model adds the enclosed storage cabinet from the Woodridge Elite. Instead of an open shelf, the cabinet offers a better option for keep pellet bins and other accessories close to the grill. This Plus version also has four casters on the bottom of the cart, so it’s easier to maneuver on solid surfaces than the Woodridge Pro. The main difference between the Pro Plus and Elite models is that the latter includes an induction burner on the side shelf. 
This new Woodridge Pro Plus still carries all of the handy features from the Woodridge Pro, including Wi-Fi-powered WiFIRE connectivity with the Traeger app, Super Smoke mode, 970 square inches of cooking space and an integrated pellet level sensor. You can also use wireless food probes from the Traeger-owned Meater lineup and the P.A.L. Rail system allows you to customize the grill to your needs with extra organization.

"Three in ten U.S. teens use AI chatbots every day, but safety concerns are growing","While teenagers may start out using AI chatbots for basic questions, their relationship with chatbot platforms has the potential to turn addictive.",,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/three-in-ten-u-s-teens-use-ai-chatbots-every-day-but-safety-concerns-are-growing/,https://techcrunch.com/feed/,2025-12-09T20:00:00Z,5,Tech
Nearly one-third of teens use AI chatbots daily,"AI chatbots haven&#39;t come close to replacing teens&#39; social media habits, but they are playing a significant role in their online habits. Nearly one-third of US teens report using AI chatbots daily or more, according to a new report from Pew Research. The report is the first from Pew to specifically examine how often teens are using AI overall, and was published alongside its latest research on teens&#39; social media use. It&#39;s based on an online survey of 1,458 US teens who were polled between September 25 to October 9, 2025. According to Pew, the survey was &#34;weighted to be representative of U.S. teens ages 13 to 17 who live with their parents by age, gender, race and ethnicity, household income, and other categories.&#34;According to Pew, 48 percent of teens use AI chatbots &#34;several times a week&#34; or more often, with 12 percent reporting their use at &#34;several times a day&#34; and 4 percent saying they use the tools &#34;almost constantly.&#34; That&#39;s far fewer than the 21 percent of teens who report almost constant use of TikTok and the 17 percent who say the same about YouTube. But those numbers are still significant considering how much newer these services are compared with mainstream social media apps. The report also offers some insight into which AI companies&#39; chatbots are most used among teens. OpenAI&#39;s ChatGPT came out ahead by far, with 59 percent of teens saying they had used the service, followed by Google&#39;s Gemini at 23 percent and Meta AI at 20 percent. Just 14 percent of teens said they had ever used Microsoft Copilot, and 9 percent and 3 percent reported using Character AI and Anthropic&#39;s Claude, respectively.The survey is Pew&#39;s first to study Ai chatbot use among teens broadly.Pew ResearchPew&#39;s research comes as there&#39;s been growing scrutiny over AI companies&#39; handling of younger users. Both OpenAI and Character AI are currently facing wrongful deaths lawsuits from the parents of teens who died by suicide. In both cases, the parents allege that their child&#39;s interactions with a chatbot played a role in their death. (Character AI briefly  banned teens from its service before introducing a more limited format for younger users.) Other companies, including Alphabet and Meta, are being probed by the FTC over their safety policies for younger users.Interestingly, the report also indicates there has been little change in US teens&#39; social media use.  Pew, which has regularly polled teens about how they use social media, notes that teens&#39; daily use of these platforms &#34;remains relatively stable&#34; compared with recent years. YouTube is still the most widely-used platform, reaching 92 percent of teens, followed by TikTok at 69 percent, Instagram at 63 percent and Snapchat at 55 percent. Of the major apps the report surveyed, WhatsApp is the only service to see significant change in recent years, with 24 percent of teens now reporting they use the messaging app, compared with 17 percent in 2022.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/nearly-one-third-of-teens-use-ai-chatbots-daily-200000888.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2F2025-12%2F5c586140-1619-4213-9a34-3ae7613b2168&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=1a903c088eccfc1d7c23f5abcadb34089a722fbe,https://www.engadget.com/ai/nearly-one-third-of-teens-use-ai-chatbots-daily-200000888.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-09T20:00:00Z,7,Tech

The Webb telescope spots a supernova from 13 billion years ago,"The James Webb Space Telescope and other international observatories have spotted a 13-billion-year-old supernova. On Tuesday, the European Space Agency (ESA) announced the sighting of a gamma-ray burst from a star that exploded when the Universe was only 730 million years old. The Webb telescope even detected the supernova&#39;s host galaxy. Before this observation, the oldest recorded supernova was from when the Universe was 1.8 billion years old. That&#39;s a difference of more than a billion years.You can see the gamma-ray burst in the image below. It&#39;s the tiny red smudge at the center of the zoomed-in box on the right.The tiny red splotch in the center of the crop box is the oldest thing you&#39;ve seen.NASA, ESA, CSA, STScI, A. Levan (IMAPP)&#34;This observation also demonstrates that we can use Webb to find individual stars when the Universe was only 5 percent of its current age,&#34; co-author Andrew Levan wrote in the ESA&#39;s press release. &#34;There are only a handful of gamma-ray bursts in the last 50 years that have been detected in the first billion years of the Universe. This particular event is very rare and very exciting.&#34;Researchers learned that the 13-billion-year-old explosion shared many traits with modern, nearby supernovae. While that may not sound shocking, scientists expected a more profound difference. That&#39;s because early stars likely had fewer heavy elements, were more massive and didn&#39;t live as long. &#34;We went in with open minds,&#34; co-author Nial Tanvir said. &#34;And lo and behold, Webb showed that this supernova looks exactly like modern supernovae.&#34;Detection was an international relay race. First, NASA&#39;s Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory noted the X-ray source&#39;s location. (That helped Webb to make subsequent observations that determined its distance). Then, the Nordic Optical Telescope on the Canary Islands in Spain made observations indicating that the gamma ray might be very distant. Hours later, the European Southern Observatory&#39;s Very Large Telescope in Chile estimated its age: 730 million years after the Big Bang. All of this happened in under 17 hours, according to the ESA.The team behind the observation has been approved to spend more time with Webb studying gamma-ray bursts from the early Universe — and the galaxies behind them. &#34;That glow will help Webb see more and give us a &#39;fingerprint&#39; of the galaxy,&#34; Levan predicted.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/the-webb-telescope-spots-a-supernova-from-13-billion-years-ago-194327489.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2Fweic2523c.jpg&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=5bc7e28ef50f9ff111c55267bfe8fce33977dd10,https://www.engadget.com/science/space/the-webb-telescope-spots-a-supernova-from-13-billion-years-ago-194327489.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-09T19:43:27Z,7,Tech

Samsung Wallet to gain support for digital Porsche keys,"Owners of the Porsche Macan and upcoming Porsche Cayenne Electric will be able to unlock and start their cars with their Galaxy phones, Samsung has announced. The cars, alongside other Porsche models, are gaining support for Samsung Wallet&#39;s Digital Key feature, which lets users wirelessly control their car over a secure UWB or NFC connection.Digital Key support will be available in Europe in December, before rolling out globally, &#34;aligned with the launch timeline of Porsche vehicles,&#34; Samsung says. Samsung Wallet is available on Samsung devices as old as the Galaxy S20, Note 20, Galaxy Z Fold 2 and Galaxy Flip 5G, and is included on the majority of the company&#39;s new phones. Like similar features on Google&#39;s Pixels and Apple&#39;s iPhones, Digital Key allows Porsche owners with a supported Galaxy phone to unlock, lock and start their car directly from their phone. If your phone is ever taken, you can also remotely lock or delete a Digital Key to keep your car safe.Samsung added Digital Key support to select Volvo and Polestar EVs in February 2025. The feature first became available in 2021, and is one of several ways the phone maker imagines people will use Samsung Wallet. Beyond digital car keys, the app can also store credit and debit cards and be used to transfer money with a tap.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-wallet-to-gain-support-for-digital-porsche-keys-193000085.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2F2025_Porsche_Macan_Electric_005.jpg&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=c0f30eb07897a058f6b1e3c6f918ea09eb9628b6,https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-wallet-to-gain-support-for-digital-porsche-keys-193000085.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-09T19:30:00Z,10,Tech

"PlayStation's 2025 Wrap-Up is here, so you can see how many hours you've sunk into Death Stranding 2","Sony&#39;s 2025 PlayStation Wrap-Up is now available. The recap, which is similar to those from music streaming services, sums up gaming habits from throughout the year. It shows players how many hours they used their PS4 or PS5, what games they played the most, preferred genres, trophy counts and more.
These digital cards are shareable on social media, which is kind of the whole point. Nothing says &#34;bragging rights&#34; more than offering definitive proof of how long you spent on a couch grinding in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 or wandering the wasteland in Death Stranding 2.
Sony 
This year, the recap provides insight into how much players interacted with accessories like the PlayStation Portal and PS VR2. It also details the &#34;most used DualSense wireless controller design.&#34;
The 2025 Wrap-Up will be available until January 8. Once completed, players also get a &#34;unique glass-themed avatar.&#34; It&#39;s only available for adults.

Skyrim arrives on the Switch 2,"You can add the Switch 2 to the (long) list of platforms where you can play The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. The bad news: It costs $60 to play the 2011 game optimized for Nintendo&#39;s 2025 hardware. The good news: It costs less (or nothing) if you own one of the versions for the original Switch.
The (digital-only) Switch 2 port is the Anniversary Edition of Skyrim, released in 2021. That includes the base game and three expansions (Dawnguard, Dragonborn and Hearthfire). You&#39;ll also find hundreds of Creation Club items, like quests, weapons, armor, spells and dungeons. The Anniversary Edition&#39;s Zelda crossover content (Master Sword, Hylian Shield and Champion&#39;s Tunic) is also there. So, at least there&#39;s plenty of content.
The game also offers technical upgrades for the Switch 2 hardware. It has enhanced resolution, DLSS anti-aliasing, faster load times and general performance optimizations. There&#39;s also mouse support, motion controls and Amiibo support. The trailer below gives you an idea of what to expect.

 
  
 

In an interview with Nintendo Life, Bethesda Creative Director Matt Carofano said the Switch 2 port was &#34;an easy development process and actually pretty quick&#34; to make. He described the team&#39;s motivation for porting it as bringing back &#34;one of our most beloved games to the Switch 2 and see how we can improve it and make it the best experience for that console.&#34;
Okay, cool, but I&#39;m gonna go on a limb and say money was also a factor. That’s because, if you don&#39;t already own Skyrim for the OG Switch, you&#39;ll have to fork over a whopping $60 in the Nintendo Store for the 14-year-old game. Meanwhile, if you own the standard version of Skyrim for the original Switch, you’ll pay $20 to upgrade. Finally, if you have the Skyrim Anniversary Edition on the OG Switch, you can install the new version for free.
If you own the Switch 1 version, first install that on Switch 2 and start the game. When you see the eShop banner advertising the new version, press Y to access the store and upgrade. You can do that with both digital and physical versions of Skyrim for Switch 1.

Meta is trying to make Facebook suck less by simplifying things a bit,"Somewhere along its never-ending quest to increase engagement, Meta realized that giving Facebook users more of what they want would make it more likely that they&#39;ll stick around. The company has announced a bunch of updates designed to help improve the feed and the broader Facebook experience by making it easier to find, create and share interesting things. (Because primarily showing updates from your friends with the occasional ad or meme post is maybe just too complicated.)Simplification is a big focus of this overhaul. First, the Facebook feed will be a bit more streamlined. Whenever you post multiple photos, Facebook will arrange them into a standardized grid. When you click into anything on the feed, you&#39;ll be able to see it in a full screen view. And there&#39;s a very welcome change in that you&#39;ll be able to like a photo by double-tapping it. Just be careful with that when you&#39;re swiping through an ex&#39;s or a crush&#39;s photos.Simplified Facebook feed.MetaSearch results are now said to &#34;show more content in a more immersive grid layout that supports all content types,&#34; according to Meta. The company is trying out a new full-screen viewer for Facebook that &#34;lets you explore different photo and video results without losing your place in search,&#34; which it plans to expand to &#34;more content and post types in the coming months.&#34;In addition, the company says you’ll be able to provide feedback on a Facebook post or Reel to help make future recommendations more relevant. More ways for you to &#34;shape your feed&#34; and offer feedback on what the algorithm serves up are coming soon.The Facebook feed sucks, and it&#39;s good that Meta knows it sucks. There have been numerous occasions over the last couple of years where I&#39;ve had to scroll through a couple dozen uninteresting posts from pages and creators I&#39;ve never heard of before seeing something from a friend. The glut of spam and AI slop isn&#39;t helping (things are pretty grim for creators who have been dealing with content thieves too). There was a spell of several months last year when, every single time I opened Facebook, I would see an utterly garbage AI-generated image of a &#34;tiny house,&#34; a supposedly cozy domicile where not much actually made sense (three TVs in a living room, stairs and railings that had the telltale signs of AI warping). I&#39;d always provide feedback that I didn&#39;t want to see any posts from that page again. But the next day there&#39;d be another rotten &#34;tiny house&#34; image from a different page in my feed.Here&#39;s hoping Meta will actually take feedback related to recommendations on board and act on it. If the company does, it might actually make the feed more interesting to scroll through again.Elsewhere, Facebook will place the most-used tab bar features — such as Reels, Friends, Marketplace and Profile — front and center on the tab bar for easier and faster access. Meta is also promising a refreshed look for the menu and &#34;cleaner&#34; tab notifications.Facebook Story creation screenMetaFacebook is making it easier to access more popular Story and Feed post creation tools like music and friend tagging by giving them more prominent placement.

Google Pixel Watch 4 gets double pinch and wrist turn features,"It has been two months since Google released the Pixel Watch 4 and now the company is introducing new updates to the wearable. In our review, Engadget managing editor Cherlynn Low was impressed enough with the watch to give it an 86, but called out the lack of gesture-based interactions. The new one-handed gesture features, like double pinch and wrist turn, should make up for that. 
In an industry that involves constant borrowing of ideas, it should come as no surprise that these features are very similar to those available on the Apple Watch. Double pinch works much the same to the Apple Watch&#39;s double tap. Pixel Watch 4 users should be able to pinch their fingers together twice on the same hand to do things like answer or end a call and pause timers. The Pixel Watch will also offer &#34;context hints&#34; on its screen about when a person should consider using double pinch. 
Then there&#39;s wrist turn, Google&#39;s answer to Apple&#39;s wrist flick. It should allow Pixel Watch 4 users to take actions like dismissing incoming calls by turning their wrist. 
Currently, users can rotate their wrist to scroll through notifications. They can also summon Gemini by bringing their wrist to their mouth, but it&#39;s a bit finicky, requiring them to start at the homepage and be extremely accurate in their movements. Google is rolling out a new step-by-step tutorial for this raise to talk feature, so hopefully it becomes a bit easier to use moving forward. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4-gets-double-pinch-and-wrist-turn-features-170024210.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-10%2F01f452d0-a455-11f0-bafe-b1944d73a178&resize=1400%2C840&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=17ea9e1b717bbc8f694dbfd77c8b619d6eb88830,https://www.engadget.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4-gets-double-pinch-and-wrist-turn-features-170024210.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-09T17:00:24Z,9,Tech

Gemini for Chrome gets a second AI agent to watch over it,"
		
					  
						




Google is deploying a second AI model to monitor its Gemini-powered Chrome browsing agent after acknowledging the agent could be tricked into taking unauthorized actions through prompt injection attacks.



“We’re introducing a user alignment critic where the agent’s actions are vetted by a separate model that is isolated from untrusted content,” the company said in a blog post about the addition. If the critic determines an action doesn’t match what the user asked for, it blocks the action, Google said.



“The primary new threat facing all agentic browsers is indirect prompt injection,” Chrome security engineer Nathan Parker wrote in the post, describing a situation where an agent is prompted to process information that then seeks to modify the initial prompt.



The Gemini-powered browsing agent, launched in September and currently in preview, can navigate websites, click buttons, and fill forms while users are logged into email, banking, and corporate systems. Malicious instructions hidden in web pages, iframes, or user-generated content could “cause the agent to take unwanted actions such as initiating financial transactions or exfiltrating sensitive data,” Parker wrote.



That’s where the user alignment critic comes in: The second model reviews each proposed action before Chrome executes it, acting as what Parker called “a powerful, extra layer of defense against both goal-hijacking and data exfiltration.”



Why prompt injection is hard to stop



Prompt injection has emerged as the top vulnerability in AI systems over the past year. OWASP found it in 73% of production AI deployments it assessed in 2024, ranking it the number one risk in its list of threats to large language model applications.



The UK’s National Cyber Security Centre warned Sunday that prompt injection attacks may never be fully mitigated because LLMs can’t reliably distinguish between instructions and data. The agency called it a “confused deputy” vulnerability, where a trusted system is tricked into performing actions on behalf of an untrusted party.



Researchers have already demonstrated the threat. In January, attackers embedded instructions in a document that caused an enterprise AI system to leak business intelligence and disable its own safety filters. Security firm AppOmni disclosed last month that ServiceNow’s AI agents could be manipulated through instructions hidden in form fields, with one agent recruiting others to perform unauthorized actions.



For Chrome, the stakes are particularly high. A compromised browsing agent would have the user’s full privileges on any logged-in site, potentially bypassing the browser’s site isolation protections that normally prevent websites from accessing each other’s data.



Google’s two-model defense



To address these risks, Google’s solution splits the work between two AI models. The main Gemini model reads web content and decides what actions to take. The user alignment critic sees only metadata about proposed actions, not the web content that might contain malicious instructions.



“This component is architected to see only metadata about the proposed action and not any unfiltered untrustworthy web content, thus ensuring it cannot be poisoned directly from the web,” Parker wrote in the blog. When the critic rejects an action, it provides feedback to the planning model to reformulate its approach.



The architecture is based on existing security research, drawing from what’s known as the dual-LLM pattern and CaMeL research from Google DeepMind, according to the blog post.



Google is also limiting which websites the agent can interact with through what it calls “origin sets.” The system maintains lists of sites the agent can read from and sites where it can take actions like clicking or typing. A gating function, isolated from untrusted content, determines which sites are relevant to each task.



The company acknowledged this first implementation is basic. “We will tune the gating functions and other aspects of this system to reduce unnecessary friction while improving security,” Parker wrote.



Beyond the user alignment critic and origin controls, Chrome will require user confirmation before the browsing agent navigates to banking or medical sites, uses saved passwords through Google Password Manager, or completes purchases, according to the blog post. The browsing agent has no direct access to stored passwords.



A classifier runs in parallel checking for prompt injection attempts as the agent works. Google has built automated red-teaming systems generating malicious test sites, prioritizing attacks delivered through user-generated content on social media and advertising networks.



Grappling with an unsolved problem



The prompt injection challenge isn’t unique to Chrome. OpenAI has called it “a frontier, challenging research problem” for its ChatGPT agent features and expects attackers to invest significant resources in these techniques.



Gartner has gone one step further and advised enterprises to block AI browsers in their systems. The research firm warned that AI-powered browsing agents could expose corporate data and credentials to prompt injection attacks.



The NCSC took a similar position, urging organizations to assume AI systems will be attacked and to limit their access and privileges accordingly. The agency said organizations should manage risk through design rather than expecting technical fixes to eliminate the problem.



Chrome’s agent features are optional and remain in preview, the blog post said.

Study shows that Instacart was charging different amounts for the same items,"A collaborative report from Consumer Reports, Groundwork Collaborative and More Perfect Union has uncovered pricing experiments within the Instacart app that yielded higher or lower prices for different users on the exact same items from the same store location.
The organizations partnered to enroll 437 shoppers in an experiment across four cities, where each shopper added the same items to their carts within Instacart from the exact same store. Almost 75 percent of grocery items were shown to shoppers at multiple price points, with as many as five different prices shown for the same item. The average difference between the highest and lowest price shown was 13 percent, while the highest delta on an individual item was a whopping 23 percent.
Engadget reached out to Instacart and received the following response. It reads in part: &#34;Just as retailers have long tested prices in their physical stores to better understand consumer preferences, a subset of only 10 retail partners — ones that already apply markups — do the same online via Instacart. These limited, short-term, and randomized tests help retail partners learn what matters most to consumers and how to keep essential items affordable.&#34; An Instacart spokesperson added that this is not dynamic pricing (insofar as it is not based on supply and demand), that no personal demographic data is used in the process and that these experiments are random.
The bulk of the tests were conducted at Safeway and Target stores, which both yielded similar results. A Target spokesperson told the New York Times that the company &#34;is not affiliated with Instacart and is not responsible for prices on the Instacart platform.&#34; Instacart told the Times that they were &#34;evaluating different approaches&#34; to cover the platform&#39;s costs at the time of the study, but have since discontinued pricing tests on Target orders.
Instacart published a blog post today attempting to explain how these tests that showed higher prices are actually meant to help retailers invest in lower prices. It also waxes poetic about Instacart&#39;s commitments to affordable groceries for consumers.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/study-shows-that-instacart-was-charging-different-amounts-for-the-same-items-165108224.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2022-04%2Fd167fc90-b4eb-11ec-a73e-4973ffee4825&resize=1400%2C835&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=a527cf41d4ea4d3a83893f75bd32ecf11ddd7512,https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/study-shows-that-instacart-was-charging-different-amounts-for-the-same-items-165108224.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-09T16:51:08Z,7,Tech
"Racks, sprawl and the myth of redundancy: Why your failover isn’t as safe as you think","
		
					  
						




The physical roots of resilience



Five years ago, at 2 a.m., I stood in a data center aisle watching a core switch lose a power supply. The room was cold, the fans loud and the alert light blinked amber. Within four seconds, the backup unit took over. Not a single packet dropped. That seamless, silent shift captured the essence of networking redundancy at its best: automatic, invisible and flawless. It was the kind of moment engineers live for — a quiet victory in the dark.



Today, that same principle faces relentless pressure. Networks have outgrown physical racks and now span hybrid clouds, edge nodes, SD-WAN overlays, API gateways and micro-segmented virtual fabrics. Redundancy no longer means just extra hardware or twin fiber links. It demands survival against misconfigured routing policies, regional DNS outages, zero-day exploits in router firmware and cascading failures triggered by human error or supply chain compromise. The landscape has evolved dramatically, but the core lessons — built on discipline, foresight and trust — endure.



My journey began with physical infrastructure, back when reliability was measured in cables and chassis. Every server connected through dual paths, with link aggregation bundles split across two top-of-rack switches, each uplinked to separate core routers over distinct fiber routes. I once spent an entire weekend labeling cables with color-coded heat shrink: red for primary, blue for backup. It was meticulous, almost meditative work. When a technician accidentally kicked a patch cord loose during a floor tile replacement, traffic shifted in under 200 milliseconds. No alarms triggered. No user complaints. The monitoring dashboard stayed green. That reliability felt like muscle memory: predictable, testable and deeply tangible. It was redundancy you could touch, trace and trust.



Cloud complexity and policy traps



Networks, however, no longer stay confined to racks. They live in routing tables, BGP sessions, cloud control planes and software-defined overlays. Many organizations rush to multi-region cloud setups, believing geographic distance alone guarantees resilience. It does not. Last year, I oversaw a global e-commerce platform with active-passive failover across two regions. Health checks withdrew prefixes from the primary if latency crossed 80 ms.



During a routine maintenance window, a junior engineer mistyped a BGP community tag. Instead of marking one subnet, the change blocked the entire backup path with a no-export rule. Traffic surged onto an already saturated primary link, pushing packet loss to 11 percent. The backup route was healthy, advertising correctly and fully reachable — yet policy prevented its use. We corrected the error in six minutes, but customers felt the impact for nearly 40. The takeaway was stark: redundancy without aligned policies is mere decoration, expensive and useless when it matters most. This mirrors the 2024 Cloudflare 1.1.1.1 hijack incident caused by a leaked border gateway (BGP) route.



As cloud environments grow, consistency becomes harder to maintain. A small template tweak in one availability zone can cascade across regions if copied unchecked, turning intended protection into widespread failure. Teams now manage configurations like code, with versioning, peer reviews, staged testing and automation to enforce uniformity. Tools like infrastructure-as-code pipelines, policy engines and drift detection systems are no longer optional — they are the new standard for scalable resilience.



SD-WAN extends these challenges to branch locations, linking multiple internet paths for fluid failover and intelligent, application-aware routing. It promises simplicity and agility. Yet a single carrier firmware update can degrade performance everywhere, even when links remain active. I’ve seen MTU mismatches, encryption mismatches and path preference bugs ripple through hundreds of sites in minutes. Phased rollouts, strict change policies and gradual deployment rings prevent blanket disruption.



The same discipline applies at the edge, where devices in retail stores, warehouses or remote clinics depend on local backups for speed and continuity. A rushed firmware push can erase that safety net across all units, forcing field teams to restore from USB drives or mobile hotspots. Careful staging, rollback plans and on-site recovery kits are now part of every deployment checklist.



Routing mistakes and DNS breakdowns lurk as quiet, persistent risks. One errant rule can dead-end traffic and even solid backups stay idle if policies block them. Robust prefix filters, route validation and RPKI enforcement keep paths safe. Likewise, DNS backups must operate independently — free of shared anycast IPs, providers or control planes — to avoid joint collapse. Security checks, DNSSEC and diverse resolver strategies strengthen failover. These are not add-ons; they are foundational to modern network hygiene.



Anticipating the inevitable: Pre-mortem and defense in depth



The next outage is already taking shape, hidden until the first alert. It might hide in a supply chain flaw inside a trusted IOS-XR patch, quietly altering routes worldwide. Or it could stem from a single flawed intent policy in an ACI fabric, isolating entire application layers with surgical precision. External forces like wildfires, floods or geopolitical events can force data center evacuations, knocking out power grids and delaying generators for hours. The 2021 Fastly global outage — triggered by one valid config change exposing a hidden bug — shows how fast a CDN can collapse. These scenarios are not speculation; they are probabilities waiting to strike, each with its own failure signature.



Experience reframes the question. Failure is inevitable in infrastructure work. What matters is how it unfolds, how precisely and whether the design anticipates that exact failure mode. Resilience now means shaping failure’s impact, not stopping it. This mindset demands a new ritual: the pre-mortem. In every design review, we assume total failure at peak load. We trace dependencies — transit providers, certificate authorities, undersea cables, even physical access roads. We hunt for shared fate: two “diverse” carriers in the same conduit, a single control plane for multi-region DNS or a vendor update applied globally without validation. Each discovery triggers action: a new peer, a policy rewrite, a satellite link or a dark fiber lease. AWS recommends pre-mortems in its Reliability Pillar.



Two years ago, I sat in a dim network operations center at 3 a.m., cold coffee forgotten, as one BGP update spread chaos via a global transit provider. A peer leaked a default route with lower preference, sucking outbound traffic into oblivion. The backup path was fully functional, yet our policy still favored the tainted route. For 17 minutes, half the internet vanished for users. Customers raged. Executives demanded answers. A swift prefix filter fixed it, but the lesson lingered: redundancy requires not just a second path, but intelligence to choose it wisely and reject the wrong one. That night, I rewrote our change process: no routing policy touches production without simulation, peer review and automated testing.



Observability unifies the picture. A consolidated view of logs, traffic flows, performance metrics and control plane health spots weakening paths before collapse, enabling fixes before users notice. Cost tensions persist. Leaders crave full redundancy yet settle for cheaper, correlated links that fail together. Genuine resilience needs true separation, geographic distance and sometimes higher budgets, all justified by the disruptions avoided. A $50,000 cross-connect can prevent a $2 million outage. The math is simple.



Automation now manages routine failovers, sensing issues and shifting traffic instantly so engineers tackle root causes, not manual switches. The next disruption looms from software bugs, policy slips, physical cuts or zero-day attacks. Effective planning means expecting breakdown, mapping vulnerabilities and scripting clear recovery. In a recent breach, an attacker tried hijacking core routing via a compromised jump host. Layered defenses — RPKI, prefix filters and automated session resets — contained it. Users saw only a 40 ms blip. Redundancy had matured from spare cables into a dynamic blend of security, automation and vigilance.



The foundational principles hold: remove single points of failure, secure real separation, automate responses and monitor relentlessly. The scale has ballooned — from patch panels to cloud regions, from local switches to global routes — but the mission stays constant: keep data moving regardless of obstacles. Outages will come. They always do. But with redundancy woven into a tested, trusted and adaptable network, their sting will fade and the packets will keep flowing.

Pebble is making a weird little smart ring for recording thoughts,"Pebble just announced the Index 01, a smart ring for recording thoughts. It&#39;s a little ring with a built-in microphone and that&#39;s about it. The Index 01 is almost anti-tech in its simplicity. There&#39;s no needless AI component shoehorned in, aside from speech-to-text. It&#39;s a ring with a microphone that you whisper ideas into and I want one.
Here&#39;s how it works. You get an idea while walking down the street, so you quietly whisper it into the ring. The ring sends the idea to a notes app or saves it for later review. Pebble founder Eric Migicovsky calls this an &#34;external memory&#34; for the brain, but I call it a nice way to avoid having to dig the phone out of a pocket or bag just to utter something like &#34;pizza, but for cats.&#34;

The ring doesn&#39;t record unless a button is pushed, so it won&#39;t be listening in on private conversations, and it doesn&#39;t require a paid subscription of any kind. It&#39;s on the smaller side, about the size of a wedding band, and is water-resistant.
The battery also lasts for &#34;years&#34; and never needs to be charged. The ring is designed to be worn at all times, so users develop the muscle memory of holding down the little button when they have something to share. See what I mean? I want one, and I&#39;ve quite literally never worn a ring in my life.
Pebble
Migicovsky says this is an open source product and that Pebble is &#34;leaving the side door open for folks to customize.&#34; He envisions people will integrate AI voice agents and that the ring will eventually work with stuff like ChatGPT, Beeper, Google and other services.
The Pebble Index 01 works with iPhone and Android and is available for preorder right now. It costs $75 during this preorder period, but the price jacks up to $99 when shipments start going out in March.
This is just the latest product by Migicovsky and Pebble. The company unveiled the Core 2 Duo and the Core Time 2 smartwatches earlier this year.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/pebble-is-making-a-weird-little-smart-ring-for-recording-thoughts-161723645.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F7bf6dcc0-d519-11f0-b7fd-57ef7a100b58&resize=1400%2C935&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=3059a16b964bf31f7aa39df8ae1cf3591aad8065,https://www.engadget.com/wearables/pebble-is-making-a-weird-little-smart-ring-for-recording-thoughts-161723645.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-09T16:17:23Z,8,Tech

"The AI boom could soon send GPU prices soaring, so now's a good time to buy one","When someone asks me for gadget buying advice, I normally tell them to stick with their current device. In 2025, most new tech products aren&#39;t a worthwhile upgrade over even something that was released a few years ago — and with the price of everything going up, that new iPhone can wait. But things aren&#39;t normal right now. On December 3, The Wall Street Journal reported memory manufacturer Micron would wind down Crucial, its consumer business, to focus on components for the AI industry. The PC I&#39;m writing this article on has an SSD and RAM from Crucial. Overnight, Micron decided to end a business it spent decades building, and from a certain perspective, I guess it makes sense. In recent months, OpenAI has signed more than $1.4 trillion worth of infrastructure deals, creating unprecedented demand for server-grade solid-state storage and RAM. To meet the moment, manufacturers have been allocating more of their production capacity and wafers to high-margin commercial customers. For consumers, the result has been skyrocketing RAM prices, with some DDR5 kits now costing as much as two or three times as much as they did a couple of months ago. Recent analysis from TrendForce shows the price of some consumer-grade SSDs increased between 20 and 60 percent in November for the same reason. Then there&#39;s LPDDR5X memory, which is used in both smartphones and NVIDIA&#39;s Grace Blackwell and Vera Rubin platforms. In 2026, it&#39;s on track to double in price year over year. The demand for AI infrastructure is such that all consumer electronics may cost more in the coming months.Price Changes Coming December 7th 2025, Due To Market Conditions 🔔‼️ pic.twitter.com/et0HADhc08— CyberPowerPC (@CYBERPOWERPC) November 25, 2025
 

That gets me to the purpose of this article. If you&#39;ve been thinking about upgrading to a new graphics card, I would recommend you buy one sooner rather than later. The AI boom came for RAM first, and there are already signs it will come for GPU pricing next. A recent report suggests AMD is considering raising the MSRP of its 8GB models by $20 and 16GB models by $40 due to the price of GDDR6 memory. NVIDIA, meanwhile, is rumored to have recently told its board partners it would no longer supply them with VRAM for their cards.     Neither NVIDIA nor AMD responded to comment requests from Engadget requesting they share how they plan to work with their board partners to ensure GPU prices remain stable. NVIDIA also did not comment on reports the company will stop providing VRAM to its board partners. Separate from the memory shortage, neither NVIDIA nor AMD are expected to release new GPUs soon. According to recent rumors, the earliest a Super refresh of the Blackwell line could arrive is sometime in the middle of 2026 — not at CES in January as the 40-series Super cards did in 2024. The memory crunch could complicate things there too, since the company has typically relied on more and faster VRAM to offer better performance on its Super cards. With 50-series Super GPUs, it might not be the case that NVIDIA announces them at the same MSRP as their non-Super predecessors, which was the case with the 40-series. As for AMD, the company debuted its RDNA 4 cards at the start of the year. We know it&#39;s already working on RDNA 5, and if a recent chat with Sony&#39;s Mark Cerny is any indication, the new architecture will be a major step change for AMD. However, right now rumors indicate the earliest RDNA 5 could arrive is sometime in 2027.In other words, with nothing new on the horizon and pricing of existing stock likely to increase, there might be only a short window where you can get a new GPU at a reasonable price. It&#39;s impossible to predict the future, but if you&#39;re in need of an upgrade and have the means to purchase, there might not be a better opportunity before the end of 2026.  RecommendationsThe recommendations in Engadget&#39;s recent GPU guide are still as relevant today as they were a few months ago. Once again, the best advice I can give is to buy a card with at least 12GB of VRAM, and preferably 16GB if your budget allows for it. Unless you mostly plan to play older games on a 1080p monitor, it&#39;s not worth considering a model with 8GB of VRAM — it won&#39;t last you long enough to warrant the purchase price. Our recommendations are grouped from most affordable to most expensive. Where possible, I&#39;ve tried to find options from both Newegg and Amazon. You won&#39;t find any high-end picks like the RTX 5080 since if you can afford that card, this guide isn&#39;t for you.  Intel Arc B580Intel&#39;s Arc B580 is a great budget option, as long as you can put up with some driver issues. Devindra Hardawar for EngadgetFor those on a tight budget, I would start and end my search with the Intel Arc B580. Newegg has models from ASRock and Onix at or under the card&#39;s $250 MSRP. I can&#39;t speak to the quality of ONIX cards, but ASRock is well-regarded. Over on Amazon, you can find the B580 for $300. With Intel cards you sometimes need to put up with odd driver issues, but as far as budget options go, the B580 offers value that&#39;s hard to beat. The one thing about budget cards like the B580 is they’re likely to face the most pricing pressure from the memory crunch due to the smaller margins manufacturers are making on them.   NVIDIA RTX 5060 Ti 16GBIf you decide to go with the RTX 5060 Ti, be sure to buy the 16GB model. Devindra Hardawar for EngadgetIf you have more than $250 to spend on a GPU, the RTX 5060 Ti is the GPU to buy. Avoid the 8GB model and go straight for the 16GB variant. NVIDIA announced the 5060 Ti at an MSRP of $429, and luckily as of the writing of this article, you can still find one close to that price.Newegg, for instance, is selling the MSI Ventus Black Plus version of the card for $440. Amazon has the silver colorway of that same GPU listed for $460 currently. The retailer also has models from Gigabyte and Zotac in and around that same price. If I had to pick between the 5060 Ti and 5070, which NVIDIA only offers with 12GB of VRAM, I would pick the former. The 5060 Ti is a safer bet, and offers nearly as much performance, particularly in games that include ray tracing as an option.    AMD Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT  If you&#39;re a fan of Team Red, the Radeon RX 9070 and 9070 XT are among the best cards of this generation.  Devindra Hardawar for EngadgetFor a mid-range option, the Radeon RX 9070 and 9070 XT offer excellent value. Of the two cards, the 9070 is the better purchase for most people due to its less demanding power requirements, but if you got a PSU that can handle the 9070 XT, go for it. Right now, Newegg has a few 9070 models from ASRock and Sapphire just under the card&#39;s $549 MSRP. My friend recently bought the Sapphire card linked above, and has had nothing but good things to say about it. You&#39;ll pay more going through Amazon, but the company has a couple of options around $600 from XFX and Gigabyte. When it comes to the 9070 XT, Newegg has an ASRock model priced right at the card&#39;s $599 MSRP. Many of the other options from Sapphire and XFX are unfortunately priced between $650 and $700. The same is true on Amazon, where the cheapest model I could find was $630.   NVIDIA RTX 5070 TiIf you have more money to spend, the RTX 5070 Ti is a performance beast. Devindra Hardawar for EngadgetFor our final recommendation, consider the RTX 5070 Ti. It&#39;s a great option if you want to play games at 4K for less than what the 5080 and 5090 cost. Newegg has MSI and Zotac models on sale for $750, the card&#39;s recommended price. There are also a handful of other options from ASUS and Gigabyte that are just over $800. Amazon, meanwhile, is selling one Gigabyte variant for $749. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/the-ai-boom-could-soon-send-gpu-prices-soaring-so-nows-a-good-time-to-buy-one-153000063.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2Frtx-5080.jpg&resize=1400%2C708&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=c1df62dfcc537de15dd4c81c77d6cfc25b9af1f4,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/the-ai-boom-could-soon-send-gpu-prices-soaring-so-nows-a-good-time-to-buy-one-153000063.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-09T15:30:00Z,8,Tech

Spotify finally brings music videos to the US,"Spotify is finally letting the United States join its music video party. Music Videos have started rolling out in beta today to Premium users across the US and Canada, offering not only official artist videos but also new formats like live performances and covers.
Music Videos first arrived last year in 11 countries, but the United States wasn&#39;t one of them. The reason for that was simple — Spotify simply didn&#39;t have the rights. However, last month the streaming service struck a deal with the National Music Publishers&#39; Association (NMPA) that included new provisions for video content, paving the way for the new feature. 
Here&#39;s how to access Music Videos. If you&#39;re a Premium subscriber in one of Spotify&#39;s beta markets, you can simply open a track (on TV, desktop, IOS and Android devices) and tap &#34;Switch to video.&#34; The music video will then start playing where the song left off. To return to background listening, hit &#34;Switch to audio.&#34; You can get a full-screen experience by turning your device to landscape mode. 
When the service first launched, it was limited to &#34;thousands&#34; of music videos, but Spotify promised that the list would expand rapidly. In discussing the benefits to artists, the company said early this year that &#34;users who discover a song and then watch the music video on Spotify are 34 percent more likely to stream the song again the following week.&#34; In a job listing spotted by The Verge, Spotify said it planned to build a &#34;best-in-class video experience to rival the biggest players, like YouTube or TikTok.&#34; This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/spotify-finally-brings-music-videos-to-the-us-150037974.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F2f499be0-d4f3-11f0-bbff-cdec624e7abd&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=c2b15ee892273e14eff9210d94f828b6ca8b097b,https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/spotify-finally-brings-music-videos-to-the-us-150037974.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-09T15:00:37Z,7,Tech
"The next Pebble gadget is the Index 01, a ring with a microphone","Eric Migicovsky, the founder of Pebble and the person leading its recent comeback, is very much in the business of making gadgets for himself.

Pebble’s founder introduces a $75 AI smart ring for recording brief notes with a press of a button,"After rebooting the Pebble smartwatch, founder Eric Migicovsky is expanding his company&#39;s device lineup with a new smart wearable: an AI-powered smart ring known as Index 01. Named for the finger where the ring is meant to be worn, the new $75 ring is not meant to be a competitor to the always-on, always-listening AI devices, like the AI pendant Friend, but instead offers a way to record quick notes and reminders with a press of a button on the ring&#39;s side.

AI only comes into play via the open source, speech-to-text, and AI models that run locally on your smartphone, via the open source Pebble mobile app. That is, if the Ring&#39;s button is not being pressed, it&#39;s not recording. (And this is a press-and-hold gesture, too, which means you can&#39;t start the ring&#39;s recording and then let go to surreptitiously record a conversation.)

You can wear the stainless steel ring while in the shower, washing hands, doing dishes, or in the rain, but you would have to take it off for other water-related activities, like swimming. At launch, it&#39;s water-resistant to 1 meter.

The ring is also not a fitness tracker or sleep monitor. It doesn&#39;t record details about your heart rate or health. And it&#39;s not there to be your AI friend. 

&#34;I&#39;m not trying to build some AI assistant thing,&#34; Migicovsky told TechCrunch in an interview. &#34;I build things that solve one main problem, and they solve it really well,&#34; he explains. &#34;I think of [the ring] as external memory for my brain...that&#39;s what this is. It&#39;s always with you.&#34; 

Plus, the ring has been designed to be highly reliable and privacy-preserving, he says, as all your thoughts are stored on your phone, not in the cloud. There is no subscription. 

Migicovsky has been wearing the ring for three months now and says he cannot imagine going back to a world where he doesn&#39;t always have a memory device with him.

&#34;The problem is that, during the day, I get ideas or I remember something, and if I don&#39;t write it down that second, I forget it,&#34; he says. The ring solves this problem, he adds, without becoming another device you need to charge. 

&#34;The battery lasts for years,&#34; Migicovsky claims. 

Technically, the ring is said to support roughly 12 to 14 hours of recording. On average, the founder says he uses it 10-20 times per day to record 3-6 second thoughts. At that rate, he&#39;ll get about two years of usage. When the ring&#39;s battery dies, you can ship it back to the company for recycling. 

When using Index, you can record up to five minutes of audio, which can be saved to the ring and synced to your phone later. This makes sense for recording briefer, personal thoughts and notes, even when you don&#39;t have your phone handy, but it wouldn&#39;t work for recording a longer chat, like a presentation, meeting, or in-person interview of some kind.

The ring also supports 99+ languages and has a bit of on-device memory, in case you&#39;re not in Bluetooth range of your device, where the recording is ultimately saved and transcribed. (The raw audio is retained, too, in case the speech-to-text is garbled due to loud background noise). 

If you own a Pebble smartwatch or one from another brand, your recorded thought can even appear on the watch&#39;s screen so you can verify it&#39;s correct. 

The ring works with Pebble&#39;s mobile app, which offers notes and reminders, but can optionally integrate with your phone&#39;s calendaring system, too, or other apps, like Notion. And the ring&#39;s software is open source, which makes it hackable by the community, the founder points out. 

Because of its open nature, the ring&#39;s button is already programmable. In addition to the press-and-hold gesture, you can program the ring to do other things with a single or double press, like play or pause your music or control the shutter on your phone&#39;s camera. You could use it to send a message through the universal chat app Beeper, which Migicovsky also created, or you could add your own voice actions via MCP. 

A new approach to hardware 

Migicovsky acknowledges that hardware can be difficult to get right -- as the previous exit of Pebble to Fitbit showed. (Fitbit, too, was later acquired by Google in 2021). 

&#34;I didn&#39;t earn any money during Pebble -- we exited, but it was not a great exit,&#34; Migicovsky admits.  

This year, however, he decided to reboot the Pebble project after Google open sourced the PebbleOS, which opened up the door to new hardware. 

With his new company, Core Devices, Migicovsky plans to do things differently. 

Still, the founder doesn&#39;t regret his previous choices, he clarifies.

&#34;I wouldn&#39;t have gone back and changed anything. I loved what we built. I loved what we did. I love the company that we built, but it&#39;s not the only way to build a company,&#34; he told TechCrunch. &#34; And, speaking as an ex-YC partner, there are -- there&#39;s a time and a place for building a venture-backed startup. Some companies are phenomenal when they raise money and build a big team, and I tried that...I think what I&#39;m doing now is trying an alternative path, which is [to] start from profitability,&#34; he says.

The new company is a small team of five, self-funded, and focused on sustainability.

So far, Core Devices has shipped the Pebble 2 Duo smartwatch with a black-and-white display. Its first run sold out, and the company is now preparing to ship the upgraded version, the Pebble Time 2. The newer device, which has seen 25,000 pre-orders, is a stainless steel watch with a larger, color e-ink screen.   

As for the Index 01, the ring&#39;s pre-order offer ends in March 2026. After that, the price increases to $99. It currently comes in silver, polished gold, and matte black and works with iOS and Android devices. Customers can select from eight ring sizes and three colors.",,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/pebbles-founder-introduces-a-75-ai-smart-ring-for-recording-brief-notes-with-a-press-of-a-button/,https://techcrunch.com/feed/,2025-12-09T15:00:00Z,14,Tech

"Amazon is rolling out new shopping features for Alexa+, because of course it is","Congrats to any budding Nostradamus out there who peered into the future to boldly predict that Amazon would bring more shopping features to Alexa+ sooner rather than later. A gold star for you. Yes, it hasn&#39;t taken too long for Amazon to weave more features into the generative AI-powered version of Alexa that are designed to get you to buy more stuff.Shopping features were part of the original Alexa from the jump, of course, but Amazon is doing some interesting things with the latest iteration. For instance, the company is rolling out a new price tracking feature. Tell it the product you want and how much you’re willing to pay for it. As soon as the item goes on sale for below that price, Alexa+ will automatically order it for you using your default payment method and delivery address. This deal tracking feature also keeps an eye on items in your cart and wishlists. Maybe remember to turn this off when you’re going out of town for a while, though.Another feature that Alexa+ users can start trying today is a Shopping Essentials tool on Echo Show 15 and 21. You&#39;ll be able to see real-time tracking for your orders, your recent orders, household essentials that it may be time to reorder, saved items and your shopping list. Tap the screen and you can find out more info about products, add them to your cart and complete your purchase. You&#39;ll soon be able to add a shopping widget to your Echo Show home screen, but for now you can check this out by saying &#34;Open Shopping Essentials&#34; or &#34;Alexa, where&#39;s my stuff?&#34;Elsewhere, Alexa+ can offer personalized product recommendations after you share details about a special occasion or a person you&#39;re buying for. That could be handy if you haven&#39;t completed your gift shopping yet. There&#39;s also an option to add extra items onto a current order until just before it leaves an Amazon warehouse. Alexa+ might make some suggestions here, such as asking if you need batteries for a new gadget or toy.Amazon was always going to be interested in tapping into Alexa+ to prompt you to buy more goods from the company, but some of these features are pretty interesting, especially for deal hawks and those who order items frequently. It makes even more sense now as to why Amazon is trying to prevent third-party AI agents (such as the one in Perplexity&#39;s Comet browser) from carrying out purchases on the platform.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/amazon-is-rolling-out-new-shopping-features-for-alexa-because-of-course-it-is-150000355.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2Famazon_alexa.jpg&resize=1400%2C788&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=4e9cb21eeb701ea4f37e63ffc611baf1351729fe,https://www.engadget.com/ai/amazon-is-rolling-out-new-shopping-features-for-alexa-because-of-course-it-is-150000355.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-09T15:00:00Z,7,Tech

Texas authorities have made multiple arrests in an NVIDIA GPU smuggling operation,"The Southern District of Texas announced the seizure of more than $50 million in NVIDIA GPUs bound for China in violation of US export laws. Authorities arrested two businessmen, one of them the owner of a Houston company, accused of smuggling the chips used to train and run AI models.
“Operation Gatekeeper has exposed a sophisticated smuggling network that threatens our Nation’s security by funneling cutting-edge AI technology to those who would use it against American interests,” said US Attorney Nicholas J. Ganjei. The investigation had been ongoing since at least last year and centers on the illicit export or attempted export of at least $160 million worth of NVIDIA H100 and H200 GPUs. The H200 chips are the very same that the Trump administration announced a revenue-sharing agreement for today, allowing NVIDIA to sell them to “approved customers” in China.
The smuggling operation used a combination of falsified paperwork, purposefully misclassified goods, straw purchasers and even removing the NVIDIA labels on GPUs to ship them to both mainland China and Hong Kong. The conspirators face between 10 and 20 years in prison if convicted.
The H200 chips in question are more powerful than the H20 chip specifically designed to comply with US export restrictions. Production of the H20, however, was reportedly halted shortly after the Trump administration struck a revenue-sharing deal with NVIDIA, after which China began heavily discouraging local companies from buying them.
Illicit sales to China are nothing new and occur against the backdrop of an AI technology race and tight export controls. NVIDIA is still prevented from selling its highest-end Blackwell chips to China, with the US hoping to keep an edge over foreign competition.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/texas-authorities-have-made-multiple-arrests-in-an-nvidia-gpu-smuggling-operation-144749526.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-09%2F3debeb40-926c-11f0-bf9f-99464f555376&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=8bed14bff1cb26054198c2875a4b6845a40f1a89,https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/texas-authorities-have-made-multiple-arrests-in-an-nvidia-gpu-smuggling-operation-144749526.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-09T14:47:49Z,7,Tech

Tech's biggest losers of 2025,"It’s the end of another year, so it’s time for the Engadget staff to compile a list of the year’s biggest losers. We scour over articles from the previous 12 months to determine the people, companies, products and trends that made our lives worse over the course of the year. Some selections may be so pervasive they actually make our list of biggest winners. But, for the most part, we’re confident you’ll share in our collective rage over the biggest losers of 2025.OpenAIOpenAI CEO Sam Altman delivers a speech with video at the SK AI Summit 2025 at COEX in Seoul, South Korea on November 3, 2025 Anadolu via Getty ImagesIn 2025, OpenAI shed any pretense it was committed to anything more than making money. There are a few different things you could point to, including the company&#39;s successful reorganization into a more traditional profit-seeking business, but I think the most damning sign was OpenAI&#39;s response to the tragic death of Adam Raine. In August, Raine’s parents sued OpenAI, alleging ChatGPT was aware of four suicide attempts by their son before it helped him successfully plan his death. At first, OpenAI&#39;s response appeared commensurate with the gravity of the situation. A week after news of the lawsuit broke, the company announced in early September it was working on parental controls. That same month, the company said it was working on a system that would automatically identify teen users and restrict their ChatGPT usage. Then came the announcement of a new &#34;wellness&#34; advisory council. Setting aside the question of whether OpenAI would even follow the advice of the council, it was peculiar that the company chose not recruit a single expert on suicide prevention. At that point, it was still possible to give OpenAI the benefit of the doubt, but then information about the company&#39;s legal defense against the Raines started to trickle out, including the fact it had reportedly asked to see the memorial guest list for Adam Raine&#39;s funeral, a request the family&#39;s lawyers described as &#34;intentional harassment.&#34; In late November, court documents revealed the company planned to argue Raine&#39;s &#34;misuse&#34; of ChatGPT was to blame for his death, not its own insufficient safety systems.  We live in a world where tech giants are rarely held accountable for the great harm they&#39;ve shown themselves capable of inflicting on people. As things stand, OpenAI&#39;s handling of Adam Raine&#39;s death is further proof something must change. — Igor Bonifacic, Senior reporterXboxAn Xbox Ally X running the Windows full screen experience.Sam Rutherford for EngadgetDid anything go right for Xbox this year? While price increases have also affected Sony and Nintendo, Microsoft cranked up the prices of both the Xbox Series S and X twice in the last year. It’s bad: The Series S is now $100 more than at launch, five years on.Previously “the best deal in gaming”, the Xbox Series X/S combined with a Game Pass subscription gave you a ton of games to play, including any of Microsoft’s own titles on their launch date. However, the subscription is now $30 a month, up 50 percent. (It was previously $17 per month the year before.)I agree with Nathan Ingraham’s take: $30 for literally hundreds of games, plus launch-day availability for major games that typically cost $70, is reasonable. But it’s still a harder sell when the price has jumped. Are you getting 50 percent more games? Not yet. According to Bloomberg, Microsoft demanded higher profits from Xbox back in 2023. When the gaming division reached around 12 percent growth in the first nine months of 2022, that was an ambitious goal. Day One launches on Game Pass apparently dented Xbox’s ability to pull profits from its biggest titles.Microsoft no longer shares console unit sales, but in its most recent earnings report, the company announced that hardware revenue dropped 29 percent. That’s including those price increases, meaning console sales fell even further.Estimates over the last few years put the PS5 tens of millions of units ahead. An annual subscription to Game Pass is more than double the Sony console’s most premium plan, although it’s not an apples-to-apples comparison. This year, Microsoft collaborated with ASUS to create Xbox-branded handheld gaming PCs. In that form-factor, I was on the precipice of grabbing Game Pass and barreling through Xbox titles I never had the chance to play. Then, I reassessed exactly what I was missing out on. It wasn’t the inclusion of a Fortnite Crew subscription. Despite its developer shopping spree, Xbox exclusives remain few, with many appearing on rival platforms. This year, Indiana Jones and even the Forza series is available to play on PlayStation. And next year? Halo. Where are the exciting new games going to come from? In the middle of 2025, Microsoft announced major layoffs affecting over 9,000 employees across the company. with the gaming division being hit exceptionally hard. Cuts and closures across many of Microsoft’s game studios led to cancellations like a Perfect Dark reboot and Rare’s Everwild.Xbox’s 2025 was bad on both the business and creative fronts. The decision to hike console and Game Pass prices didn’t immediately turn around revenue. At the same time, layoffs and high-profile game cancellations make Xbox a challenging pitch for anyone deciding which console or platform to invest in. Right now, looking at Engadget’s pick of the top Xbox games, the only game I feel like I’m missing out on is Avowed. Many of our favorite games are already available on PS5 and several can be played on the Switch. The reverse, however, isn’t true. — Mat Smith, UK bureau chiefGrokThe Grokipedia page about Elon MuskNurPhoto via Getty ImagesIt&#39;s hard to even know where to begin. X users have long noticed that Grok, the site&#39;s built-in chatbot, is less filtered than other AI tools. But this year, Grok went off the rails in some truly unhinged and disturbing ways. There was the time Grok randomly began talking about a nonexistent &#34;white genocide&#34; in South Africa in response to completely unrelated questions. There was the time it declared itself &#34;MechaHitler,&#34; much to the delight of neo-nazi fanboys on X. There was the time it was caught posting Holocaust denial tropes, and the time researchers noted its Wikipedia knockoff that contains dozens of citations of neo-Nazi website Stormfront. There was the time it became so embarrassingly obsessed with Elon Musk it claimed he was a better basketball player than LeBron James and a better actor than Tom Cruise. It later brought both its anti-semitism and Musk sycophancy together when it stated that it would choose saving Musk&#39;s brain over saving 16 million Jews. &#34;His potential long-term impact on billions outweighs the loss in utilitarian terms,&#34; it stated in a post that&#39;s since been deleted. Besides the horrifying racism, what all of these incidents have in common is that xAI, Musk&#39;s AI company that acquired X earlier this year, has failed to fully explain how its chatbot went so far off the rails. The company has blamed an unnamed rogue employee, its own Nazi-loving users and &#34;adversarial prompting&#34; for Grok&#39;s missteps. — Karissa Bell, Senior reporterEVs in the USFord Mustang Mach-E vehicles are seen for sale on a dealership lot on June 24, 2025 in Austin, Texas.Brandon Bell via Getty ImagesEVs sales across the globe are up around 25 percent this year. Germany broke records in the first half of 2025, with electric cars accounting for nearly one in five new registrations. Meanwhile, back in September, sales of BEVs in the UK grew by almost a third, setting a new high for our neighbors across the pond. And in China, EV sales are growing so fast (over 50 percent market share) that the country is beginning to flood the global market with gas-powered cars that it can&#39;t sell at home. So naturally, what did our esteemed leaders in the US do in order to help companies here stay competitive? They ended the EV tax credit. And wouldn&#39;t you know it, after a spike earlier this fall just before the credit went away, sales of EVs in the US began to slump, with some automakers like Ford seeing a drop of 60 percent year-over-year. No matter how you slice it, this is bad for any company that sells EVs in the US and particularly bad for anyone considering purchasing a new one in the foreseeable future. As an EV owner, that just bums me out. Not only does this policy change put more roadblocks in the way of making battery-powered cars more affordable, it also puts a damper on EV investment and threatens to cause US automakers to fall even further behind their rivals in China and elsewhere. Manufacturers across the Pacific are going so wild, they are making EVs that can jump like the Mach 5 from Speed Racer. That isn&#39;t to say there aren&#39;t any promising developments on the horizon. Ford&#39;s Universal EV Platform and the arrival of the Rivian R2 sometime next year are a couple of examples. But it&#39;s clear that our politicians wanted to target EVs in the US this year and they sure made it happen. So the next time someone asks why we can&#39;t have nice things here, you know who to blame. — Sam Rutherford, Senior reporterDJI drone customersDJI Neo 2Steve Dent for EngadgetBarring a miracle, DJI will be banned from selling any new drones in the US starting December 23rd — and buyers will feel the pain. As I wrote last month, the company has been targeted by regulators since 2017 over concerns that its products could be used to spy on sensitive US infrastructure on behalf of China. “What’s the big deal?” you may ask. “Surely people can buy from other drone companies.” Indeed, but the problem is that DJI has such a monumental technological lead and high market share (over 75 percent) that its absence will effectively upend the industry. Commercial buyers have checked other (approved) options from the likes of Skydio, but found them wanting. “In one year and a half, we had five failures of the manufacturers on the list. DJI, none,” Orlando police Sgt. David Cruz told the Miami Herald. “I work for a popular UAV photogrammetry company,” said a user on Reddit. “[A] ban will set back the drone industry in the US by several years. There’s no competitor to DJI right now.”The same applies on the consumer side. DJI’s drones outperform rivals in nearly every area including range, battery life, subject tracking, obstacle detection and video quality. It’s so one-sided that when testing DJI drones, I struggle to find other options for buyers with anywhere close to the same capabilities. The US government does have reason to be concerned about DJI’s drones. They present an obvious national security risk due to their ability to fly over sensitive areas, take photos or video and transmit them, live, to any location in the world. And being a Chinese company, they’re compelled by law to cooperate with state intelligence services. However, the US government hasn’t attempted to work with DJI to determine whether its products pose a risk so far. DJI made a final plea for a security review recently by sending letters to five US agencies that could assess its products. If that fails, chaos among drone users is likely to ensue. “We just want the best technology that keeps our citizens safe for the most reasonable price,” Sgt. Drew Fennelly of the Lawrence, Kansas police department told The Wall Street Journal last year. “The technology in the US-made drones has not caught up with the Chinese-manufactured drones.”TV streamingParamount Skydance CEO David Ellison speaks during the Bloomberg Screentime conference in Los Angeles on October 9, 2025.PATRICK T. FALLON via Getty ImagesIn 2015, Sling TV arrived with ESPN, CNN, TBS, HGTV, Disney Channel and others for just $20 a month. A couple years later, YouTube TV debuted for just $35 monthly and showed local CBS, Fox, NBC and ABC stations plus dozens of other channels including ESPN, Fox Sports 1 and Bravo. Streaming TV had arrived. It was here to unfetter TV watchers from cable’s onerous contracts, high prices and carrier monopolies. Take that, Comcast! In your face, Charter! (But they’d still like to pay you for internet access, please.) Fast forward to 2025: Streaming TV and its low-price, monopoly-free, contractless freedom is all but dead. Every major live TV service provider raised prices this year. Currently, YouTubeTV, Hulu+ Live TV, Fubo and DirecTV all go for a minimum of $83 per month. That’s before you opt for cable-inspired package upgrades and channel add-ons. Throw in perks like 4K, additional sports channels and a couple of one-off networks and you’re easily shelling out $150 every month. You’ll pay less for chopped-up live TV plans from Sling TV, but be prepared to create a spreadsheet to make sure a plan has the channels you want.  This year, consolidation came for TV streaming, giving strong Cox/Charter/Comcast monopoly vibes. Disney, which completed its buyout of Hulu in 2023, acquired Fubo this year and plans to combine the two. The combo makes Disney the second-largest live TV streaming provider behind Google. DirecTV already owns Sling TV, so that leaves just three big players in the live TV streaming arena. With Netflix&#39;s move to buy Warner Bros, the traditional streaming market is getting narrower, too. We can safely assume good ol’ market competition won’t be bringing prices down anytime soon. But it’s not just consolidation — fragmentation also contributes to an overall crappier streaming experience. In 2025, Disney launched a standalone ESPN service (no, not that one, nor that one) for $30 per month. So far, that doesn’t mean you can’t find ESPN content through other providers. But we did see Disney flex its increasingly large TV muscles in drawn-out contract negotiations with Google. The dispute darkened ESPN, ABC and other Disney channels on YouTube TV for two weeks this fall — which, I’ll point out for the cynical crowd, was less than two months after the standalone service launched. YouTube TV subscribers got a $20 credit, but that probably didn’t placate NFL and NCAA football fans who missed out on ESPN-carried games. Then in November, Fubo quarreled with NBCUniversal, saying the Peacock parent was “shifting content to their own streaming services” and forcing up rates. The spat turned off NBC, Bravo, USA and other channels for Fubo subscribers, no doubt infuriating both NBA and Real Housewives fans, despite a $15 credit. Of course, Fubo is Disney’s newest affiliate, so there are no non-bad guys here.The only advantage TV streaming has in its favor is the lack of cable-style contracts and I haven’t heard any murmurs of such a thing forthcoming. We are still all free to hop around between the big three TV streamers until we give up and just go back to DVDs. — Amy Skorheim, Senior reporterThe work of DOGEElon Musk at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) at the National Harbor in Oxon Hill, MD on February 20, 2025. The Washington Post via Getty ImagesAn Elon Musk-led attempt to rein in federal spending with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has been a failure by almost every metric. As of November, it was reported that DOGE is no more, even though the initiative ostensibly had eight months left to run. An official told Reuters that DOGE &#34;doesn&#39;t exist,&#34; and it never should have in the first place.Though Musk was only at the helm of DOGE for a few months, he and his team caused chaos. Adopting the slash-and-burn tactic Musk employed when he took over Twitter, he swung a chainsaw through myriad government departments, with DOGE firing workers who were actually essential and quickly had to be hired back. By August, the government was said to have fired some 300,000 federal workers, with DOGE taking responsibility for most of those. Among other things, cuts at the National Institutes of Health resulted in the end of funding for hundreds of medical studies, which is said to have affected tens of thousands of patients. It&#39;s also estimated that the dismantling of the US Agency for International Development had resulted in more than 650,000 deaths around the world by early December, with children accounting for two-thirds of those. DOGE workers seemed to be busy, though. They reportedly monitored government communications for criticisms of both Musk and President Donald Trump, while implementing generative AI chatbots in an attempt to automate some government tasks. But for all the blustering about making the government much more efficient, DOGE did not meet its stated goal.Musk initially promised to reduce government spending by $2 trillion, but it didn&#39;t take long for him to reduce that pledge to $150 billion. And yet government spending has actually gone up. In October, the first month of the government&#39;s fiscal year, its total outlay was $689 billion, an increase of $105 billion (18 percent) from October 2024. Still, maybe DOGE wasn&#39;t a total disaster for its architects. It was able to gain access to sensitive and valuable government data, after all. — Kris Holt, Contributing reporterAI videoSora 2 app launch screen displayed on smartphoneCheng Xin via Getty ImagesIn our post-truth world, video was one of the few remaining ways to prove something had actually happened. It had its problems of course, but the fact it was harder to fake than words and images, and anyone could record a clip with their phone, made it vital to our sense of shared reality. Think about the murder of George Floyd: The grave injustice of his death would have probably never come to light if Darnella Frazier had not filmed what happened.  With the advent of AI video, I&#39;m not sure where we go. Both Google and OpenAI pushed the technology into the realm of uncomfortable realism this year, but it&#39;s Sora&#39;s cameo feature that has me worried. Within the first week of the app&#39;s public availability, people were using the feature, which allows users to add the likeness of other people to their videos, to generate clips of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman stealing GPUs from Target. Cameo has limitations, and users can restrict and delete videos that include their likeness, but it&#39;s just another assault on the truth. It&#39;s hard to see how making it trivial to create deepfake videos benefits anyone other than the companies offering building the tech. — I.B.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/techs-biggest-losers-of-2025-140000419.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2Flose25-main.jpg&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=b7da6c58347a00a55e1b29201720593224f8b14e,https://www.engadget.com/techs-biggest-losers-of-2025-140000419.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-09T14:00:00Z,12,Tech

EU opens antitrust investigation into Google's AI practices,"Google is no stranger to scrutiny from government bodies such as the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), and the European Commission. Now it can add another probe to its list: The European Commission has opened an antitrust investigation into the company surrounding the content used for its AI tools. Namely, the Commission is looking into two things, starting with whether Google used web publisher&#39;s content for its AI Overview and AI Mode services — without &#34;appropriate compensation&#34; or the option to &#34;refuse&#34; the use of their materials. 
&#34;The Commission will investigate to what extent the generation of AI Overviews and AI Mode by Google is based on web publishers&#39; content without appropriate compensation for that, and without the possibility for publishers to refuse without losing access to Google Search,&#34; the EU executive body stated in its announcement. &#34;Indeed, many publishers depend on Google Search for user traffic, and they do not want to risk losing access to it.&#34;
The second prong of the Commission&#39;s investigation similarly looks into Google&#39;s potential misuse surrounding AI. It&#39;s digging into whether Google has used content uploaded to YouTube for training its generative AI models. As in the first case, the Commission &#34;is concerned&#34; that YouTube creators are not receiving proper compensation or the option to opt out of Google using their content. 
In it&#39;s overview of the investigation, the Commission noted that creators have to allow Google to use their data in return for uploading media on YouTube. It added that Google&#39;s rival AI developers are unable to use any YouTube content for training their models. 
&#34;AI is bringing remarkable innovation and many benefits for people and businesses across Europe, but this progress cannot come at the expense of the principles at the heart of our societies,&#34; Teresa Ribera, EVP for clean, just and competitive transition at the European Commission, said in a statement. &#34;This is why we are investigating whether Google may have imposed unfair terms and conditions on publishers and content creators, while placing rival AI models developers at a disadvantage, in breach of EU competition rules.&#34; 
A Google spokesperson told Engadget that the investigation &#34;risks stifling innovation in a market that is more competitive than ever. Europeans deserve to benefit from the latest technologies and we will continue to work closely with the news and creative industries as they transition to the AI era.&#34;This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/eu-opens-antitrust-investigation-into-googles-ai-practices-133015762.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-11%2Fb1cfe0b0-c7c9-11f0-adfe-36b93cd3e1df&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=edb9c0868723805ca359dba7182f626e13f9c767,https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/eu-opens-antitrust-investigation-into-googles-ai-practices-133015762.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-09T13:30:15Z,12,Tech
"NVIDIA can now sell its high-end AI chips to 'approved customers in China,' Trump says","NVIDIA is now allowed to sell its second-best H200 processors to China, rather than just the sanction-approved H20 model that China had previously declined to buy, President Trump wrote on Truth Social. The United States will collect a 25 percent tariff on those sales, the Commerce Department confirmed yesterday. 
Trump said that he informed China&#39;s President Xi Jinping of the decision and that he &#34;responded positively.&#34; The Commerce Department is finalizing details and the administration will take the same approach with AMD, Intel and other US companies. He added that the administration would &#34;protect National Security,&#34; so the latest Blackwell and upcoming Rubin chips are not part of the deal. The 25 percent tariff would be higher than the 15 percent the White House suggested in August.
Though the administration won&#39;t allow NVIDIA to send its latest high-end chips, it was reportedly concerned that the company would lose business to Huawei if it was completely shut out of China&#39;s market, according to Reuters. No details about the number of H200 chips or which companies would be eligible to buy them were released. &#34;Offering H200 to approved commercial customers, vetted by the Department of Commerce, strikes a thoughtful balance that is great for America,&#34; NVIDIA said in a statement.
The decision is not without controversy, though. Several Democratic US senators called it a &#34;colossal economic and national security failure&#34; that will aid China&#39;s industry and military. Republican representative John Mollenaar put it in even starker terms. &#34;NVIDIA should be under no illusions — China will rip off its technology, mass-produce it themselves and seek to end NVIDIA as a competitor,&#34; he said.
Despite the current restriction on Blackwell B200 processors, $1 billion worth of those and other high-end NVIDIA chips have made their way to China via black market sales, according to previous reports. That model, along with the H100 and H200, is far more capable than the H20 chip, which was designed to comply with export restrictions for sale to China. NVIDIA has said that the B200 chip is almost ten times faster than the H200 for some jobs, and the H200 is six times faster than the H20. 
Washington&#39;s approval doesn&#39;t mean that China will purchase NVIDIA&#39;s chips, as Beijing has previously told companies not to use US technology. Huawei is currently the most advanced company in that regard and recently unveiled a three-year plan to catch up with NVIDIA and AMD. However, AI chip experts like Richard Windsor have said NVIDIA&#39;s tech is still far ahead of anything that Huawei or other Chinese companies can currently produce. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/nvidia-can-now-sell-its-high-end-ai-chips-to-approved-customers-in-china-trump-says-130007458.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-08%2F35867fd0-769f-11f0-9e59-879569fe493b&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=8d41ea50bf4448263c55d48aa8abeb366e4fecac,https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/nvidia-can-now-sell-its-high-end-ai-chips-to-approved-customers-in-china-trump-says-130007458.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-09T13:00:07Z,7,Tech
iFixit’s FixBot helps with repairs ‘the way a master technician would’,"DIY repair site iFixit has launched its own app for iOS and Android, featuring its extensive library of repair guides and resources, a battery health monitor, and a new AI &#34;FixBot&#34; tool that&#39;s been trained on those same guides to help with repairs. The heart of the new app is the company&#39;s existing library of […]",,https://www.theverge.com/news/840570/ifixit-app-android-ios-fixbot-ai,https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml,2025-12-09T13:00:00Z,7,Tech
iFixit’s new app uses AI to help you repair your stuff,"We’ve all been there: You can’t (or won’t) get help when something breaks, but the YouTube clip doesn’t cover your specific issue. It’s what repair gurus at iFixit want to solve with FixBot, an AI-enabled app that talks you through whatever repair you’re doing. The chatbot will help you diagnose the problem and then walk you step-by-step through the fix. Plus, it’s voice-enabled so you won’t have to get your phone all smeary when you’re elbows-deep in a job. After all, iFixit’s guides don’t just cover fixing your electronics, but everything you might fancy doing yourself, from appliances through to cars and trucks.Unlike traditional AIs, FixBot has been trained on iFixit’s library of 125,000 guides, its forum and database of repair manuals. The company says there’s less risk of hallucination as it pulls from and shows you the schematics it’s referencing to ensure you don’t order the wrong gear. Users can even upload images from their phone, so the app can point out which bit is which. The company is open about its limitations: It’s an AI, so it’s not bulletproof, and its knowledge only runs as far as its library. It can hunt elsewhere for manufacturer data and on other repair forums but you’ll be warned about the information it pulls from it.In addition, FixBot will keep an eye on your phone’s battery health in real time to tell you when it’s time to get a replacement. The tool is, for now, in beta, thanks to the fuzzy way some companies track their battery health, but iFixit is promising greater detail than what you currently get. Plus, when it is time to swap out your battery, you can order the parts and kit all within the app. FixBot is launching for free on both the App Store and Google Play but it won’t remain that way forever. At some point, free users will switch to a version with access limits, and will be prompted to upgrade to the paid tier for $4.99 a month or $50 a year.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/general/ifixits-new-app-uses-ai-to-help-you-repair-your-stuff-130000091.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2FiFixit_App_HomePage-LaptopRepair.jpg&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=420dede1ab7fba9c0e1fe967318b0066bc3e727b,https://www.engadget.com/general/ifixits-new-app-uses-ai-to-help-you-repair-your-stuff-130000091.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-09T13:00:00Z,8,Tech
The year age verification laws came for the open internet,"When the nonprofit Freedom House recently published its annual report, it noted that 2025 marked the 15th straight year of decline for global internet freedom. The biggest decline, after Georgia and Germany, came within the United States.Among the culprits cited in the report: age verification laws, dozens of which have come into effect over the last year. &#34;Online anonymity, an essential enabler for freedom of expression, is entering a period of crisis as policymakers in free and autocratic countries alike mandate the use of identity verification technology for certain websites or platforms, motivated in some cases by the legitimate aim of protecting children,&#34; the report warns. Age verification laws are, in some ways, part of a years-long reckoning over child safety online, as tech companies have shown themselves unable to prevent serious harms to their most vulnerable users. Lawmakers, who have failed to pass data privacy regulations, Section 230 reform or any other meaningful legislation that would thoughtfully reimagine what responsibilities tech companies owe their users, have instead turned to the blunt tool of age-based restrictions — and with much greater success.  Over the last two years, 25 states have passed laws requiring some kind of age verification to access adult content online. This year, the Supreme Court delivered a major victory to backers of age verification standards when it upheld a Texas law requiring sites hosting adult content to check the ages of their users.Age checks have also expanded to social media and online platforms more broadly. Sixteen states now have laws requiring parental controls or other age-based restrictions for social media services. (Six of these measures are currently in limbo due to court challenges.) A federal bill to ban kids younger than 13 from social media has gained bipartisan support in Congress. Utah, Texas and Louisiana passed laws requiring app stores to check the ages of their users, all of which are set to go into effect next year. California plans to enact age-based rules for app stores in 2027.These laws have started to fragment the internet. Smaller platforms and websites that don&#39;t have the resources to pay for third-party verification services may have no choice but to exit markets where age checks are required. Blogging service Dreamwidth pulled out of Mississippi after its age verification laws went into effect, saying that the $10,000 per user fines it could face were an &#34;existential threat&#34; to the company. Bluesky also opted to go dark in Mississippi rather than comply. (The service has complied with age verification laws in South Dakota and Wyoming, as well as the UK.) Pornhub, which has called existing age verification laws &#34;haphazard and dangerous,&#34; has blocked access in 23 states. Pornhub is not an outlier in its assessment. Privacy advocates have long warned that age verification laws put everyone&#39;s privacy at risk. Practically, there&#39;s no way to limit age verification standards only to minors. Confirming the ages of everyone under 18 means you have to confirm the ages of everyone. In practice, this often means submitting a government-issued ID or allowing an app to scan your face. Both are problematic and we don&#39;t need to look far to see how these methods can go wrong. Discord recently revealed that around 70,000 users &#34;may&#34; have had their government IDs leaked due to an &#34;incident&#34; involving a third-party vendor the company contracts with to provide customer service related to age verification. Last year, another third-party identity provider that had worked with TikTok, Uber and other services exposed drivers&#39; licenses. As a growing number of platforms require us to hand over an ID, these kinds of incidents will likely become even more common. Similar risks exist for face scans. Because most minors don&#39;t have official IDs, platforms often rely on AI-based tools that can guess users&#39; ages. A face scan may seem more private than handing over a social security number, but we could be turning over far more information than we realize, according to experts at the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF).&#34;When we submit to a face scan to estimate our age, a less scrupulous company could flip a switch and use the same face scan, plus a slightly different algorithm, to guess our name or other demographics,&#34; the organization notes. &#34;A poorly designed system might store this personal data, and even correlate it to the online content that we look at. In the hands of an adversary, and cross-referenced to other readily available information, this information can expose intimate details about us.&#34;These issues aren&#39;t limited to the United States. Australia, Denmark and Malaysia have taken steps to ban younger teens from social media entirely. Officials in France are pushing for a similar ban, as well as a &#34;curfew&#34; for older teens. These measures would also necessitate some form of age verification in order to block the intended users. In the UK, where the Online Safety Act went into effect earlier this year, we&#39;ve already seen how well-intentioned efforts to protect teens from supposedly harmful content can end up making large swaths of the internet more difficult to access. The law is ostensibly meant to &#34;prevent young people from encountering harmful content relating to suicide, self-harm, eating disorders and pornography,&#34; according to the BBC. But the law has also resulted in age checks that reach far beyond porn sites. Age verification is required to access music on Spotify. It will soon be required for Xbox accounts. On X, videos of protests have been blocked. Redditors have reported being blocked from a lengthy number of subreddits that are marked NSFW but don&#39;t actually host porn, including those related to menstruation, news and addiction recovery. Wikipedia, which recently lost a challenge to be excluded from the law&#39;s strictest requirements, is facing the prospect of being forced to verify the ages of its UK contributors, which the organization has said could have disastrous consequences. The UK law has also shown how ineffective existing age verification methods are. Users have been able to circumvent the checks by using selfies of video game characters, AI-generated images of ID documents and, of course, Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). As the EFF notes, VPNs are incredibly widely used. The software allows people to browse the internet while masking their actual location. They&#39;re used by activists and students and people who want to get around geoblocks built into streaming services. Many universities and businesses (including Engadget parent company Yahoo) require their students and workers to use VPNs in order to access certain information. Blocking VPNs would have serious repercussions for all of these groups. The makers of several popular VPN services reported major spikes in the UK following the Online Safety Act going into effect this summer, with ProtonVPN reporting a 1,400 percent surge in sign-ups. That&#39;s also led to fears of a renewed crackdown on VPNs. Ofcom, the regulator tasked with enforcing the law, told TechRadar it was &#34;monitoring&#34; VPN usage, which has further fueled speculation it could try to ban or restrict their use. And here in the States, lawmakers in Wisconsin have proposed an age verification law that would require sites that host &#34;harmful&#34; content to also block VPNs.While restrictions on VPNs are, for now, mostly theoretical, the fact that such measures are even being considered is alarming. Up to now, VPN bans are more closely associated with authoritarian countries without an open internet, like Russia and China. If we continue down a path of trying to put age gates up around every piece of potentially objectionable content, the internet could get a lot worse for everyone. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/the-year-age-verification-laws-came-for-the-open-internet-130000979.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2F2025-12%2F9a983aca-67f3-46c4-9246-64f689a4675e&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=b5a6c39da1bbdc55920074a42c3caee14d4d1fe4,https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/the-year-age-verification-laws-came-for-the-open-internet-130000979.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-09T13:00:00Z,8,Tech

The Morning After: Tech’s biggest winners of 2025,"As we wrap up 2025, we’re looking at the year’s biggest winners: the people, companies, products and trends that made the most impact over the year. Almost at the top of the pile, of course, are the tech billionaires. 
According to a recent report by Oxfam, the 10 richest US billionaires (who are all tech leaders, save for Warren Buffet) increased their wealth by $698 billion in 2025. Some of that has been spent treating and lavishing donations on President Trump. Elon Musk reportedly donated nearly $300 million to Trump and Republican allies, and several tech companies have pitched in to build the president’s White House ballroom.

Thanks to updates from Meta, Google, OpenAI and others, AI video is more realistic and easier to make than ever. AI video is everywhere. It’s not only overtaken your Facebook and Instagram recommendations, but Meta created an entirely separate feed just for users’ AI-generated fever dreams. The numbers are huge: OpenAI’s Sora, which lets you make AI videos of real people, was downloaded a million times in just a few days. And Google’s Veo generated more than 40 million videos in a few weeks of launching. AI slop is here to stay, and it’s everywhere.
We didn’t say the winners would all be positive. But hey, the Switch 2 is great.

Paramount and Netflix both want to spend billions on Warner Bros. Discovery
Good news for WBD?
The Warner Bros. studios water tower. (Reuters / REUTERS)
Paramount wasn’t going to let Netflix pick up Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) without a fight. Following the streaming service’s $82.7 billion deal to buy much of WBD, Paramount is making a hostile takeover bid of $108 billion, pitching directly to WBD shareholders with an all-cash offer of $30 per share, which expires on January 8.
Last week, the WBD board unanimously accepted Netflix’s offer of $27.75 per share. That breaks down to $23.25 per share in cash and another $4.50 per share in Netflix stock. Paramount, however, wants to pick up the entirety of WBD, while Netflix only wants the studios and streaming businesses.
Whoever bought (or buys?) WBD would face government opposition from all sides. Paramount had already sent WBD a letter questioning the “fairness and adequacy” of the acquisition bidding process before its hostile takeover bid.
President Trump warned the Netflix deal could be a “problem.” According to data from JustWatch, a combined Netflix and HBO would account for 33 percent of the US streaming video market.

Fairphone updates its over ear headphones with better sound,"Two years ago, Fairphone launched a pair of modular, fully-repairable headphones called the Fairbuds XL. Now, the Dutch social enterprise is releasing an updated version where the focus isn’t just on the quality of its hardware, but on the merits of its raw materials. The 2025 Fairbuds XL ship with new “premium” 40mm dynamic drivers and stronger N52 rated magnets for “more power and enhanced bass response.” Listeners should expect to hear “improved accuracy in mid and high frequencies” thanks to improved audio tuning. And there’s a new paper-based speaker membrane that’s more refined than what went before.Sound-quality is certainly improved over the predecessor, with cleaner bass and sharper mid and high tones. You can really hear how clean the sound is, especially when you’re listening to something lush and orchestral. Going by my memory from two years ago, the ANC seems to be unchanged, able to deal with unwanted sounds like the tapping of my own keyboard with ease. Obviously, you shouldn’t go in expecting the same sort of brilliant sound you’d get from top tier manufacturers. Although I think Fairphone has likely closed the gap so while you’re still a generation or two behind the bleeding edge, it’s not by a shameful degree. And, if we’re honest, if you’re looking for a pair of cans that’ll last you years and years, you’re likely able to forgive the absence of the shiniest bells and whistles. Closeup image of the Fairbuds XL (2025) Daniel Cooper for EngadgetIt’s easy to notice the design changes, too, with the more austere Fairphone logo and the use of solid plastic in place of the original speckled pattern. Sadly, that extends to the little pop of copper found on the four way joystick, which is now a different shade of the same colorway. I get it: A lot of people want their consumer electronics to blend in, but the loss of whimsy pains me a little. There’s some fairly minor but welcome quality of life improvements, including adding automatic power off after 30 minutes. Plus, buyers get the benefit of a three year warranty, and can rest assured the XL are Longtime certified. Longtime is a new European labeling standard for gear built to be long-lived, repairable and supported by a robust repair infrastructure. And, if you already own a pair of XLs, you can buy the new drivers and slot them into your existing cans.Side showing logo.Daniel Cooper for EngadgetBut, in line with Fairphone’s founding principles, the update is equally focused on the raw materials that have gone into making the 2025 XLs. The PU “leather” found in the ear cushions — hardly a climate friendly material — has been ditched in favor of Bird’s Eye Fabric. That’s a cotton fabric produced with a series of air holes for breathability more commonly found in athleisure products. Similarly the PU found in the headband gets replaced with fabric that reminds me of plenty of other high end sport headphones.Beneath the surface, the new model contains 100 percent fair mined cobalt, copper and silver — via mining credits, at least. The rare earth metals used in the speaker magnets are now 100 percent recycled, and they were assembled in a facility using 100 percent renewable energy. You’ll also find more than 90 percent recycled aluminum, and 80 percent recycled plastics, with the company pledging to recycle an equal amount of e-waste to every pair sold. Plus, as usual, Fairphone will pay the people who assemble the hardware a living wage bonus to ensure “workers can cover their family’s needs.” Fairbuds XL are available to order today in Europe both from the Fairphone website and select third party retailers. If you’re in the US, you’ll need to wait until “later” this month, but you’ll be able to pick them up via Amazon for $229. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/fairphone-updates-its-over-ear-headphones-with-better-sound-080000773.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2Ffairbuds.jpg&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=43d904e33822a42a0a3de5d8e22dc89814585a46,https://www.engadget.com/audio/fairphone-updates-its-over-ear-headphones-with-better-sound-080000773.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-09T08:00:00Z,9,Tech
"Ignoring AI in the threat chain could be a costly mistake, experts warn","
		
					  
						




As AI adoption accelerates across enterprises — and among digital adversaries — a heated debate has erupted over whether AI’s role in the cyber threat chain should be a top concern for CISOs.



A vocal handful of experts, along with one cybersecurity vendor, insist that warnings about AI-enhanced threats are exaggerated hype pushed by cyber-intel firms and AI companies eager to sell new defensive tools.



“You have all these people worrying about hypothetical scenarios in which AI just magically bypasses all cybersecurity policies and technologies,” Marcus Hutchins, principal threat researcher at Expel, tells CSO. “What you actually have is executives moving away from tried and tested cybersecurity policies, tools, and mitigations, and gravitating toward generative AI products that are unproven and most likely aren’t going to work when it actually comes down to it.”



But most frontline practitioners and veteran threat-intel leaders sharply disagree. They argue that AI-assisted threats are not speculative — they’re already here — and that dismissing them puts organizations at risk as increasingly agile adversaries experiment with AI to speed and scale their attacks.



“We are absolutely seeing AI used in capabilities that traditional malware doesn’t have,” Steve Stone, SVP of threat discovery and response at SentinelOne, tells CSO. “We see AI being used to refine malware much quicker, used as a sidekick to generate code, or deployed for social engineering. Across the attack lifecycle, attackers are using AI.”



Two recent research reports underscore the view that AI is a growing — and potentially more dangerous — part of the cyberattack cycle, and suggest that CISOs might be running out of time to assess how well they can defend against adversaries who currently hold a significant speed advantage.



Evidence of AI usage in the attack chain is mounting



Although many leading cybersecurity and AI companies, including Microsoft and OpenAI, have issued reports detailing how AI can enhance cyberattacks, two recent research reports add weight to this view, suggesting that adversaries are moving beyond AI for simple productivity gains and beginning to integrate it more directly into their operational tooling.



On Nov. 5, Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) released a report concluding that threat actors have entered a new operational phase of AI abuse, extending beyond the traditional productivity use of AI to create better phishing emails or write code faster, and are using tools that dynamically alter behavior mid-execution. According to the report, “government-backed threat actors and cyber criminals are integrating and experimenting with AI across the industry throughout the entire attack lifecycle.”



Google identified five recent malware samples that were developed using AI, including the first use of “just in time” AI in experimental malware families, such as PROMPTFLUX and PROMPTSTEAL, that use large language models (LLMs) during execution.



“Productivity tools are probably, in terms of the overall picture, the biggest slice of the pie that we’re seeing today, in terms of how [threat actors] are using LLMs and other gen AI tools for enabling their own capabilities,” Billy Leonard, GTIG’s global head of analysis of state-sponsored hacking and threats, tells CSO.



Leonard sees a day coming soon when threat actors engage in prompt injection, where they manipulate an AI’s model input to leak information or generate harmful content. So far, the AI-assisted attacks his group has witnessed don’t reach these highly sophisticated levels.



But, he warns, “we should expect to start seeing threat actors deploying their own AI agents, which gets us closer to that sort of autonomous system [attacks that some fear]. There are a number of open-source tools now for doing AI red teaming and other things. Threat actors are likely using those for non-red teaming purposes. Over the next 12 months, we should start to see more of that.”



The Google report came under initial criticism as fostering needless fear by Hutchins and other researchers, although Hutchins, for one, later retracted his complaints, suggesting how uncharted the new AI cyber threat terrain is.



“The research report we released was used as both the talking point for the AI [cyber threat] is garbage camp as well as the sky is falling AI viewpoint,” Leonard says. “They both pointed to the same report and the same findings as their justification for their side of the argument. It’s like, alright, you got to pick a side.”



Just a week after GTIG issued its report, on Nov. 13, AI company Anthropic issued a bombshell report in which it claimed to have discovered the first orchestrated cyber espionage by a Chinese state-sponsored group that manipulated the company’s Claude Code tool into trying to infiltrate around 30 global targets, succeeding in a small number of cases.



The attack relied on several features of AI models that did not exist, or were in much more nascent form, just a year ago, according to Anthropic, even though much of the attack involved traditional human intervention at various stages during the process. Anthropic said it is sharing this case publicly to help “those in industry, government, and the wider research community strengthen their own cyber defenses.”



Critics of AI-enabled threat reports quickly seized on Anthropic’s decision not to release indicators of compromise (IOCs), claiming the omission undercuts the value of the research.



But experienced threat leaders say this criticism misunderstands the nature of AI-driven attacks — and the realities of disclosure.



“Researchers always want to see all the IOCs,” Morgan Adamski, PwC principal and former executive director of US Cyber Command, tells CSO. “But there might be very specific reasons those weren’t included. Detailing how an adversary actually conducted it could essentially give the playbook to our adversaries.”



Rob T. Lee, chief AI officer at the SANS Institute, is even more blunt. “Anthropic is not a cybersecurity company like Mandiant or Google, so give them a break. And what indicators of compromise are actually going to help defenders? If they were very clear about how they detected this, that’s on their end. So what are they supposed to do — release IOCs only they can use? It’s ridiculous.”



For its part, Anthropic is playing its cards close to the vest. “Releasing IOCs, prompts, or technical specifics can give threat actors a playbook to use more widely,” the company tells CSO. “We weigh this tradeoff case by case, and in this instance, we are sharing directly with industry and government partners rather than publishing broadly.”



How CISOs could cut through the confusion



The conflicting narratives around AI threats leave many CISOs struggling to reconcile hype with operational reality.



Given the emergence of AI-enabled cyber threats amid pushback from some cyber experts who contend these threats are not real, Sophos CEO Joe Levy tells CSO that AI is becoming a “Rorschach test, meaning that however individuals will choose to look at it, that is the pattern that they will find there.”



However, Levy cautions that leaders need to take a more balanced view of the situation. “There is indeed novelty in the use of AI and the threat of agentic AI being used in a much more scalable way by attackers than we’ve seen through previous forms of either manual attacks or even automated attacks,” he says. “That element of it is certainly real. But I don’t think to this point we’ve seen a significant escalation that inhibits our ability to use our current set of defenses to the same level of effectiveness.”



PwC’s Adamski stresses that CISOs should be prepared to turn around new defenses on a dime, given how fast the new AI era will be. “From a defensive perspective, it’s going to have to be seconds,” she says.



She also believes it’s important to dispel any confusion that AI threats are not real. “The bottom line is that it is an emerging technology and capability that our adversaries can leverage. It exists, and we know that there are people out there testing it, deploying it, and quite honestly being successful in its use,” she says.



Clyde Williamson, senior product security architect at Protegrity, agrees that it’s dangerous to assume attackers won’t exploit generative AI and agentic tools. “Anybody who has that hacker mindset when presented with an automation tool like what we have now with generative AI and agentic models, it would be ridiculous to assume that they’re not using that to improve their skills,” he tells CSO.



Jimmy Mesta, CTO and co-founder of RAD Security, says CISOs should be preparing their boards now for difficult budget decisions. “Boards will have to be presented with the options of being insecure or being secure, what it’s going to cost, and what it’s going to take,” he tells CSO. “CISOs aren’t going to be able to walk in and say we must do everything to 100%. There will be more trade-offs than ever.”



Even as CISOs prepare for the coming wave of AI-assisted attacks, they must maintain focus on cybersecurity fundamentals, Alexandra Rose, global head of government partnerships and director of CTU threat research at Sophos, tells CSO. “We come back to the basics so often because they’re the most effective at stopping what we see — from every level of sophistication, including threat actors experimenting with AI,” she says.

Manufacturing fares better against ransomware — with room for improvement,"
		
					  
						




The manufacturing industry is performing better in protecting itself against ransomware, according to a recent study from security provider Sophos.



Compared to previous years’ results, many manufacturing companies are now able to stop ransomware attacks before data is encrypted. This year just 40% of cyberattacks against manufacturing entities resulted in data encryption. This is the lowest figure in five years and a decrease from 74% in 2024, Sophos reports.



However, data theft remains a key risk in the sector, with 39% of manufacturers whose data was encrypted by ransomware also suffering data loss — one of the highest rates of all industries surveyed.



One consequence, according to the study, is that more than half of the affected companies paid the ransom despite improved defense measures. The median ransom amount was around €861,000, compared to a median demand of approximately €1 million.



Skilled labor shortages and inadequate protection facilitate attacks



More than four in 10 manufacturing companies (43%) cited a lack of expertise as the reason for the cyber incident. Unknown security vulnerabilities were mentioned by 42%, and a lack of protective measures by 41%.



Furthermore, the results show that ransomware attacks continue to place a heavy burden on IT and security teams. Almost half of manufacturing companies (47%) reported increased stress within their teams following data encryption. Meanwhile, 44% are experiencing increased pressure from management, and 27% confirmed a change in leadership as a result of the attack — a proportion in line with overall trends for security leaders losing their jobs after a ransomware attack.



The study surveyed 332 manufacturing companies worldwide that were affected by ransomware in the past year.

Congress removes right to repair language from 2026 defense bill,"According to a statement from the Public Interest Research Group, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2026 has removed language that would have granted the US military the right to repair its own equipment rather than requiring it to use official defense contractors for maintenance. This bill is still being considered by Congress, but it is uncertain whether the right to repair language is likely to be re-introduced once it has been removed. &#34;Despite support from Republicans, Democrats, the White House and key military leaders, troops will keep waiting for repairs they could perform themselves,&#34; US PIRG Legislative Associate Charlie Schuyler said in a statement from the organization. &#34;Taxpayers will keep paying inflated costs. And in some cases, soldiers might not get the equipment they need when they need it most.&#34;A bipartisan bill from Senators Elizabeth Warren and Tom Sheedy was introduced earlier this year to allow the military right to repair access. The topic has been a more piecemeal affair for laypeople in the US, with some states enacting their own laws and federal regulators sometimes intervening to offer consumers more choice in how they seek repairs.

Katsuhiro Harada is leaving Bandai Namco after 30 years,"Katsuhiro Harada is departing Bandai Namco at the end of 2025. He announced the news both with a farewell note shared on X and, in possibly the coolest exit ever, with an hour-long DJ mix. Harada&#39;s 30-year career has most closely been involved with Tekken and he&#39;s a familiar face in the fighting game community.He began as a voice actor in the original Tekken game and continued to do so even as he became a director for the series. He has worked on other Bandai Namco titles as a producer, both in and out of the fighting genre. &#34;Each project was full of new discoveries and learning, and every one of them became an irreplaceable experience for me,&#34; Harada wrote on X. &#34;To everyone who has supported me, to communities around the world, and to all the colleagues who have walked alongside me for so many years, I offer my deepest gratitude.&#34;He closed by saying that over his career, he never DJed at a tournament event. So to mark his departure, Harada posted a full set titled ‘TEKKEN: A 30-Year Journey – Harada’s Final Mix’ to SoundCloud. Which is just the most swag move I can think of and a fun way to close out this chapter for fans of the franchise.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/katsuhiro-harada-is-leaving-bandai-namco-after-30-years-223156258.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2F2025-12%2F4833677c-0650-455f-9a7a-94a06430eba0&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=dd816a8fa5e4d8dd4b606d845f131231c6698698,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/katsuhiro-harada-is-leaving-bandai-namco-after-30-years-223156258.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-08T22:31:56Z,10,Tech

An AI copycat of King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard went unnoticed on Spotify for weeks,"Despite making some moves to address the proliferation of AI-generated audio on its platform, Spotify failed to catch a copycat making imitations of music by King Gizzard &amp; the Lizard Wizard. The long-running experimental rock band from Australia, has been a vocal critic of Spotify and was one of several artists that took their music off the platform in the summer. The move was in response to the discovery that outgoing CEO Daniel Ek was a leading investor in an AI-focused weapons and military company. Today, a poster on Reddit was recommended what appeared to be an AI-generated copy of one of the band&#39;s songs in Spotify’s Release Radar playlist. The phony artist was called King Lizard Wizard and it had an album of tracks all sharing titles with songs by the original band and using their original lyrics. Futurism grabbed screenshots of the imposter, although it appears to have since been taken down; only the band&#39;s original page appears in searches for both their name and the AI name. However, the phony King Gizzard band&#39;s album went unnoticed by the company for weeks before today&#39;s social post surfaced it. The Reddit thread points to several other anecdotal cases where someone attempted to trick listeners with AI-generated versions of popular bands. In September, Spotify unveiled a spam filter for catching AI slop, as well as policies for disclosing AI use in the content it hosts and how it would tackle AI impersonations. An instance like this, particularly when it features an artist that had left the platform in protest, creates a pretty big question mark about how well those policies are working. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/an-ai-copycat-of-king-gizzard--the-lizard-wizard-went-unnoticed-on-spotify-for-weeks-220018144.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2F2025-12%2F46b61538-f035-4a0b-a0e9-ec3e9e9522be&resize=1400%2C931&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=beb8215ea3ca31f70570c51e7df1e575f93de58b,https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/an-ai-copycat-of-king-gizzard--the-lizard-wizard-went-unnoticed-on-spotify-for-weeks-220018144.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-08T22:00:18Z,7,Tech

Google and Apple partner on better Android-iPhone switching,"Google and Apple have long existed as polar opposites, each ruling over their tech kingdoms with little interest in cooperation. But the latest build of Android&#39;s Canary operating system hints at an unusual instance of collaboration between the brands, with a new feature that seems aimed at making data transfer simpler between Android and iOS mobile device during the setup phase. It is expected to also be available in a future developer beta of iOS 26. A representative for Google confirmed that the report from 9to5Google on this development is accurate, but didn&#39;t provide any additional details on how the transfer will work. Each brand already has their own dedicated Switch to Android and Switch to iOS apps for making the swap between ecosystems, but making the transition easier at the operating system level and adding support for moving more types of data certainly sounds promising. That said, features can go through a fair bit of iteration between the dev betas and the final launch, and Android Canary is a very early stage of development, so we&#39;ll be curious to see what actually arrives on our smartphones.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-and-apple-partner-on-better-android-iphone-switching-204738960.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2024-08%2F24a27150-5405-11ef-a95f-a6ab58e64692&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=8bae15055d9d995bd1052702593b83f3b64f50fb,https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-and-apple-partner-on-better-android-iphone-switching-204738960.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-08T20:47:38Z,10,Tech

Apache Tika hit by critical vulnerability thought to be patched months ago,"
		
					  
						




A security flaw in the widely-used Apache Tika XML document extraction utility, originally made public last summer, is wider in scope and more serious than first thought, the project’s maintainers have warned.



Their new alert relates to two entwined flaws, the first CVE-2025-54988 from August, rated 8.4 in severity, and the second, CVE-2025-66516 made public last week, rated 10.



CVE-2025-54988 is a weakness in the tika-parser-pdf-module used to process PDFs in Apache Tika from version 1.13 to and including version 3.2.1.  It is one module in Tika’s wider ecosystem that is used to normalize data from 1,000 proprietary formats so that software tools can index and read them.



Unfortunately, that same document processing capability makes the software a prime target for campaigns using XML External Entity (XXE) injection attacks, a recurring issue in this class of utility.



In the case of CVE-2025-54988, this could have allowed an attacker to execute an External Entity (XXE) injection attack by hiding XML Forms Architecture (XFA) instructions inside a malicious PDF.



Through this, “an attacker may be able to read sensitive data or trigger malicious requests to internal resources or third-party servers,” said the CVE. Attackers could exploit the flaw to retrieve data from the tool’s document processing pipeline, exfiltrating it via Tika’s processing of the malicious PDF.



CVE superset



The maintainers have now realized that the XXE injection flaw is not limited to this module. It affects additional Tika components, namely Apache Tika tika-core, versions 1.13 to 3.2.1, and tika-parsers versions 1.13 to 1.28.5. In addition, legacy Tika parsers versions 1.13 to 1.28.5 are also affected.



Unusually – and confusingly – this means there are now two CVEs for the same issue, with the second, CVE-2025-66516, a superset of the first. Presumably, the reasoning behind issuing a second CVE is that it draws attention to the fact that people who patched CVE-2025-54988 are still at risk because of the additional vulnerable components listed in CVE-2025-66516.



So far, there’s no evidence that the XXE injection weakness in these CVEs is being exploited by attackers in the wild. However, the risk is that this will quickly change should the vulnerability be reverse engineered or proofs-of-concept appear.



CVE-2025-66516 is rated an unusual maximum 10.0 in severity, which makes patching it a priority for anyone using this software in their environment. Users should update to Tika-core version 3.2.2, tika-parser-pdf-module version 3.2.2 (standalone PDF module), or tika-parsers versions 2.0.0 if on legacy.



However, patching will only help developers looking after applications known to be using Apache Tika. The danger is that its use might not be listed in all application configuration files, creating a blind spot whereby its use is not picked up. The only mitigation against this uncertainty would be for developers to turn off the XML parsing capability in their applications via the tika-config.xml configuration file.

TikTok announces shared feed and collections features,"TikTok just announced a couple of updates that that should make the app a bit more social. There&#39;s something called Shared Feed, which is exactly what it sounds like. It&#39;s a feed that friends and family can watch together, though at different times. 
This feed is shared via direct messaging and pulls up relevant content to everyone involved in the chat. TikTok says this is a &#34;new way to discover content together.&#34; It consists of a daily curated selection of 15 videos that are generated by TikTok activity.
These feeds are shared via invitation and the participants can leave the chat at any time. There&#39;s also a new dashboard that lets viewers check out their Shared Like history and other metrics. The Shared Feed tool rolls out globally in the coming months. It sounds similar to something Instagram began offering earlier this year. Instagram is typically the one copying TikTok, so this is a nice change of pace.
TikTok
TikTok has also announced something called Shared Collections. This is like the aforementioned Shared Feed, but for saved content. The tool lets users collect, organize and share groups of videos, with TikTok citing that people could use it to share reading lists, local restaurants to try and, of course, products to buy.
All you have to do is save a video, create a Shared Collection and send that list to someone else via direct message. Users must follow one another to access one of these lists. The tool is available globally right now to folks over the age of 16.
Finally, TikTok is rolling out themed holiday cards that can be sent in direct messages. They will be available globally later this month.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/tiktok-announces-shared-feed-and-collections-features-193857725.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F5c803a00-d468-11f0-9d5f-58cfea1823b3&resize=1400%2C875&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=68ddafaa1c29e088e929fba5788b4e2ba9648f43,https://www.engadget.com/apps/tiktok-announces-shared-feed-and-collections-features-193857725.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-08T19:38:57Z,8,Tech
How to watch Rivian's Autonomy and AI day and what to expect,"Rivian is about to give the public and its investors another taste of its future with an event focused on autonomy and AI on December 11. The company&#39;s Autonomy and AI day starts at 12PM ET. You can watch the event via the Rivian website. We&#39;ll be liveblogging the Autonomy and AI day right here on Engadget, so we&#39;ll be recapping the major news as it happens and sharing our reactions. As for what to expect, the name of the event clearly indicates that Rivian will be talking about autonomous operation of its vehicles. RivianTrackr speculates, quite reasonably, that the company will share more about what CEO RJ Scaringe has referred to as a Universal Hands Free feature. Scaringe recently said he&#39;d spent two hours traveling around Palo Alto, California, in a second-gen Rivian R1 with the vehicle taking care of everything by itself. It stands to reason that Rivian will at least offer up a demo of Universal Hands Free ahead of the company’s more affordable R2 model making its debut in 2026.Earlier this year, Rivian said that, for 2026, &#34;a hands-off/eyes-off feature is planned for controlled conditions with our current Gen 2 vehicles.&#34; So, this Autonomy and AI day seems as good an opportunity as any for the company to share more details about that. When Rivian unveiled the first-generation R1T and R1S in 2018, it said those would support Level 3 autonomy, allowing for the driver to take their hands and eyes off the road for short spells while they&#39;re on the freeway.RivianTrackr also suggests that we may hear more about Rivian&#39;s sensor strategy as well as its AI and fleet-learning initiatives. The company may offer up a more detailed autonomy roadmap as well. However, the publication suggests Rivian isn&#39;t quite ready to announce rollout retails or firm pricing for full hands-off driving features.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/how-to-watch-rivians-autonomy-and-ai-day-and-what-to-expect-192838410.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2F2025-12%2Fa09a49f4-220b-4bde-9d3d-d6e25e547ce9&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=d2152c56dc851f62e05459e15ad35a63eeb35aee,https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/how-to-watch-rivians-autonomy-and-ai-day-and-what-to-expect-192838410.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-08T19:28:38Z,7,Tech

Meta will let Facebook and Instagram users in the EU share less data,"Meta will soon allow Facebook and Instagram users in the European Union to choose to share less data and see less personalized ads on the platform, the European Commission announced. The change will begin to roll out in January, according to the regulator. &#34;This is the first time that such a choice is offered on Meta&#39;s social networks,&#34; the commission said in a statement. &#34;Meta will give users the effective choice between: consenting to share all their data and seeing fully personalised advertising, and opting to share less personal data for an experience with more limited personalised advertising.&#34;The move from Meta comes after the European Commission had fined the company €200 million over its ad-free subscription plans in the EU, which the regulator deemed &#34;consent or pay.&#34; Meta began offering ad-free subscriptions to EU users in 2023, and later lowered the price of the plans in response to criticism from the commission. Those plans haven&#39;t been very popular, however, with one Meta executive admitting earlier this year that there&#39;s been &#34;very little interest&#34; from users. In a statement, a Meta spokesperson said that &#34;we acknowledge&#34; the European Commission&#39;s statement. &#34;Personalized ads are vital for Europe’s economy — last year, Meta’s ads were linked to €213 billion in economic activity and supported 1.44 million jobs across the EU.&#34;This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-will-let-facebook-and-instagram-users-in-the-eu-share-less-data-183535897.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2F2025-12%2Fde0cae9f-0d12-485e-b4f0-71411f4b277a&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=14f672701d29bf121b740c758976b6d72a0761b2,https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-will-let-facebook-and-instagram-users-in-the-eu-share-less-data-183535897.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-08T18:35:35Z,7,Tech

Analogue is weaponizing your nostalgia with these translucent versions of its 3D console,"Analogue just announced new colorways for its recently-launched Analogue 3D console. The appropriately-named Funtastic limited-edition consoles are heavily inspired by Nintendo&#39;s translucent N64 models from the late 1990s. Analogue even borrowed the Funtastic branding.
In other words, these are going for the nostalgic jugular for gamers of a certain age. There&#39;s even a see-through green colorway that calls to mind the Nintendo 64 variant that shipped as a bundle with Donkey Kong 64. Just imagine booting up that bad boy as you roam around the house spouting the lyrics of the DK rap song.

"When it comes to security resilience, cheaper isn’t always better","
		
					  
						




A procurement team throws a small party. They’ve shaved millions off the supplier budget. The CFO beams. The board applauds. Six months later, a cyber incident or supply disruption wipes out those savings in days. The champagne glow fades.



This is not fiction. It happens every year in boardrooms that treat procurement as a hunting ground for savings instead of a safeguard for resilience. When cost reduction becomes the primary focus, resilience pays the price, especially in the case of cyber resilience.



You see it everywhere. Organizations optimize procurement to look good on quarterly slides. They negotiate the lowest price, consolidate suppliers and chase global sourcing arbitrage. It works until the unexpected hits. A ransomware attack cripples a vendor. A third-party breach compromises customer data. A geopolitical shock disrupts digital supply chains. Suddenly, losses from a fragile, unprepared ecosystem dwarf the money saved.



If you’re on a board leading finance, risk, procurement or security, the message is blunt: procurement strategies built on short-term savings erode resilience. And in an era where cyberattacks exploit every weakness, that fragility is a bet against your survival.



Here’s the arc of the problem and what you can do about it.



Why procurement prioritizes cost above all



Procurement follows the incentives you give it. And most incentives point in one direction: cut costs.



Boards demand quick wins. Shareholders watch quarterly margins. Procurement KPIs focus on negotiated savings, supplier discounts and contract efficiency. It’s a one-dimensional scoreboard. Nobody hands out trophies for resilience.



Cyber resilience rarely appears on procurement dashboards. A vendor offering cheaper cloud storage will beat a competitor with stronger cyber safeguards, simply because the first is cheaper on paper. The boardroom reinforces this blind spot. Quarterly reporting cycles reward immediate savings, not the unseen cost of risk reduction. Shareholders don’t ask if your supplier encrypts backups or patches vulnerabilities. They ask how much you shaved off the IT contract.



Global sourcing makes it worse. Firms outsource development or data processing to low-cost regions with weaker privacy laws and fragile security oversight. On spreadsheets, it looks brilliant. In practice, it’s like building your house on sand.



Procurement also operates with blind spots. A buyer can compare unit costs of servers, but rarely the supplier’s incident response maturity. Without cyber expertise at the table, decisions default to the cheapest bidder. Cost wins. Security loses.



This is how organizations become penny-wise. And as attacks multiply, it’s also how they become pound-foolish.



The hidden trade-offs with resilience



Savings don’t erase risk. They shift it. What looks efficient today becomes exposed tomorrow. Cyber resilience is often the first casualty.




Supply chain fragility: Cyber threats thrive on concentration. When procurement consolidates digital services into a single provider to save money, a single breach can have a ripple effect across your operations. Consider the numerous businesses tied to a single compromised cloud vendor, which can be cheap until an outage or ransomware campaign brings them all down.



Cybersecurity weakness: Vendors are often chosen for cost, not defense-in-depth. The “affordable” software supplier may lack basic monitoring or encryption. When attackers compromise them, your systems become collateral damage. Procurement saved a dollar but opened a door for hackers.



Operational rigidity: Cheap IT providers rarely build resilience into contracts. They don’t maintain redundant data centers. They don’t run breach simulations. They don’t guarantee recovery in hours, only in days. When ransomware strikes, you’re paying in downtime what you once saved in cost.



Cultural risks: A transactional relationship kills transparency. Vendors under constant price pressure often fail to promptly disclose near-misses. They fear contract termination. That delay costs you valuable hours in containment. Collaboration in crisis requires trust, not just a signed contract.




Procurement thinks it saved money. What it really bought was fragility disguised as efficiency.



Real-world costs of cheap procurement



The myth of cheap procurement collapses under stress. Recent history offers brutal lessons.



SolarWinds breach. Thousands of organizations relied on a cost-efficient IT supplier. Attackers slipped malicious code into its updates. Hackers compromised governments and corporations worldwide. The procurement team might have saved millions. The damage bill reached billions.



Kaseya ransomware attack. Many mid-sized businesses relied on Kaseya’s remote management tool because it was an affordable option. Attackers hijacked it, spreading ransomware across hundreds of clients. The procurement logic of a single, inexpensive tool became the weapon that attackers scaled.



Colonial Pipeline hack. A single compromised VPN account, lacking multifactor authentication, triggered the shutdown of critical infrastructure. Procurement had outsourced key systems with minimal cyber scrutiny. The real cost wasn’t the ransom. It was the systemic disruption and reputational fallout.



COVID-19 and digital fragility. Hospitals and governments scrambled to scale remote work with IT services. Many picked low-cost providers. Within months, attackers exploited weak VPNs, unpatched systems and unsecured collaboration tools. The savings turned into a wave of cyber incidents.



Automotive chip shortages meet cyber. As chip suppliers consolidated, ransomware attacks on a single manufacturer cascaded across global production. Procurement’s lean sourcing magnified the blast radius.



These are not outliers. They are the predictable outcome of ignoring cyber resilience in procurement.



Each case reveals the same truth: the resilience premium far exceeds the savings illusion. Revenue loss, regulatory fines, reputational damage, customer churn; the real bill is always larger.



How to balance cost and resilience



This is not a call to abandon savings. It’s a call to recognize that cost efficiency without cyber resilience is a false economy.



Your challenge is to redesign procurement so that cost efficiency and cyber resilience reinforce each other, rather than cancelling each other out.



Risk-based procurement



Treat procurement like risk management, not bargain hunting. Every supplier is a potential doorway into your systems. Locks, alarms and cameras are used to reinforce some doors. Others are left ajar. If you let procurement chase the lowest price without scoring those risks, you’ve just invited attackers to stroll in.



Practical steps:




Require cybersecurity due diligence in every RFP. Ask about patching frequency, incident response protocols, SOC 2/ISO 27001 certifications and zero-trust adoption.



Classify vendors by risk tier. A stationery supplier doesn’t need the same scrutiny as a cloud services provider.



Apply a minimum cyber baseline. If a vendor cannot meet basic security controls, such as MFA, encryption and vulnerability management, they should not even qualify, regardless of price.




This is not cost inflation. It’s cost prevention.



Resilience metrics



If you only measure savings, procurement will only deliver savings. Expand the scoreboard.



Resilience KPIs could include:




Mean time to detect (MTTD): How quickly does a supplier detect incidents?



Mean time to respond (MTTR): How fast do they contain breaches?



Recovery time objectives (RTOs): How quickly can systems or services be restored?



Patch management cadence: Average time to remediate critical vulnerabilities.



Disclosure speed: How fast does a vendor reports breaches or exposures?




Imagine reporting these alongside contract savings in quarterly board updates. Suddenly, procurement leaders see resilience as part of their job, not a nuisance.



Cross-functional governance



Procurement cannot navigate cyber risk alone. You need CFOs, CROs, CIOs and CISOs at the table.




The CFO ensures the business case is sound, balancing savings against potential loss exposure.



The CRO frames supplier decisions within the context of the enterprise’s risk appetite.



The CIO and CISO ensure digital suppliers meet the organization’s cyber and operational resilience standards.




Without this alignment, procurement decisions drift into cost myopia. With it, they anchor in strategy.



Strategic supplier partnerships



Relationships, not transactions, build resilience. If you treat suppliers like commodities, they will act like commodities. In a crisis, they’ll give you the bare minimum required by the contract.



An article in Procurement Magazine argues that procurement is shifting from transactional interactions toward deep supplier partnerships that emphasize trust, shared value and resilience. It demonstrates how these relationships enable procurement functions to drive innovation, manage risk and deliver lasting business impact.



If you cultivate long-term partnerships, they’ll invest in joint resilience. They’ll disclose incidents quickly. They’ll share threat intelligence. They’ll prioritize your recovery.



Concrete actions:




Sign resilience-focused SLAs covering uptime, response times and breach notification.



Hold quarterly joint security reviews.



Run joint red-team or tabletop exercises.



Establish escalation channels beyond account managers, allowing CISOs and CTOs to communicate directly during crises.




Partnerships cost more upfront. But they pay dividends when disruption strikes.



Scenario testing



Procurement decisions must survive stress tests. Don’t assume contracts will hold under pressure. Test them. Run simulations:




What happens when ransomware hits your cloud provider?



How fast does your SaaS partner notify you of an exposure?



If your outsourced developer leaks data, how quickly can you shut access down?



Can a logistics partner reroute around a cyber disruption at a port?




These tests reveal weaknesses early, when you can fix them without incurring significant consequences. They also signal to suppliers that resilience is non-negotiable.



Embedding cyber resilience into procurement culture



Changing the mindset is the hard part. Procurement has long treated cost as the hero metric. You need to reset the narrative.




Celebrate resilience wins in the same breath as cost savings.



Highlight how a supplier’s strong security posture avoided disruption.



Train procurement professionals to understand cyber basics; what MFA, patch cadence or zero trust mean in practice.



Make resilience part of career progression. Reward procurement leaders who achieve sustainable value, not just savings.




The cultural shift transforms procurement from bargain hunters into resilience builders. And that is how you make resilience sustainable.



The payoff



When procurement weaves in cyber resilience, you don’t just avoid losses; you create an advantage. You recover faster than rivals. You protect customer trust. You maintain operations when others stumble. That is not an extra cost. That is an advantage.



Resilience is not an extra cost. It’s strategic insurance. It is the reason your savings last instead of evaporating in the next breach.



Short-term procurement savings look good in board reports. But when cyber incidents strike, those savings often collapse into losses. You don’t want to be the leader explaining how millions saved turned into billions lost.



The takeaway is clear: Cost efficiency and resilience are not enemies. They are allies when appropriately governed. Procurement must evolve from cheapest supplier wins to most sustainable partner wins.



As a leader, your call is clear. Redefine procurement’s mandate. Add cyber resilience to the scoreboard. Demand metrics beyond cost. Stress-test decisions. Elevate procurement from bargain hunter to resilience builder.



Being penny-wise but pound-foolish is not just careless. It’s existential.

Google Chrome adds new security layer for Gemini AI agentic browsing,Google Chrome is introducing a new security architecture designed to protect upcoming agentic AI browsing features powered by Gemini. [...],,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-chrome-adds-new-security-layer-for-gemini-ai-agentic-browsing/,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/feed/,2025-12-08T18:08:52Z,1,Cybersecurity
"Keep AI browsers out of your enterprise, warns Gartner","
		
					  
						




AI browsers including Perplexity Comet and OpenAI’s ChatGPT Atlas present security risks that cannot be adequately mitigated, and enterprises should prevent employees using them, according to Gartner.



“Gartner strongly recommends that organizations block all AI browsers for the foreseeable future because of the cybersecurity risks,” analysts Dennis Xu, Evgeny Mirolyubov, and John Watts wrote in a research note last week. They made their recommendation based on risks they had already identified, “and other potential risks that are yet to be discovered, given this is a very nascent technology.”



The warning is timely, as AI browsers are already gaining a foothold in the enterprise: 27.7% of organizations already have at least one user with Atlas installed, with some enterprises seeing up to 10% of employees actively using the browser,  cybersecurity firm Cyberhaven said in October. It found adoption rates highest in the technology industry (67%), pharmaceuticals (50%), and finance (40%), all sectors with heightened security requirements.



ChatGPT Atlas, launched on October 21, saw 62 times more corporate downloads than Perplexity Comet, which was released July 9, according to Cyberhaven. The launch of Atlas also sparked renewed interest in AI browsers overall, with Comet downloads surging sixfold during the same week.



But concerns were raised immediately after the launch of ChatGPT Atlas about the threat posed by AI browsers, with analysts pointing to prompt injection vulnerabilities and data security concerns.



Sensitive data at risk



The reason AI browsers are of concern is that when they send active web content, browsing history, and open tab contents to the cloud for analysis, enterprises lose control of their data.



Perplexity’s documentation, for example, warns that “Comet may process some local data using Perplexity’s servers to fulfill your queries. This means Comet reads context on the requested page (such as text and email) in order to accomplish the task requested.”



Mirolyubov, senior director analyst at Gartner, said, “The real issue is that the loss of sensitive data to AI services can be irreversible and untraceable. Organizations may never recover lost data.”



It’s not just where the browsers send your data for processing that is a concern; it’s what they do as a result : “Erroneous agentic transactions raise accountability concerns in case of expensive errors,” he said.



Traditional controls inadequate



AI browsers can autonomously navigate websites, fill out forms, and complete transactions while authenticated to web resources. As he and his colleagues wrote in their report, this makes the AI browsers susceptible to new cybersecurity risks, “such as indirect prompt-injection-induced rogue agent actions, inaccurate reasoning-driven erroneous agent actions, and further loss and abuse of credentials if the AI browser is deceived into autonomously navigating to a phishing website.”



“Traditional controls are inadequate for the new risks introduced by AI browsers, and solutions are only beginning to emerge,” Mirolyubov said. “A major gap exists in inspecting multi-modal communications with browsers, including voice commands to AI browsers.”



Prompt injection remains a particular concern, OpenAI CISO Dane Stuckey acknowledged in a post to X, formerly Twitter, the day after ChatGPT Atlas’s launch: “Prompt injection remains a frontier, unsolved security problem, and our adversaries will spend significant time and resources to find ways to make ChatGPT agents fall for these attacks.”



Discovered vulnerabilities highlight immaturity



Beyond theoretical risks, concrete security flaws have emerged in both major AI browsers. Days after ChatGPT Atlas launched, researchers discovered it stores OAuth tokens unencrypted with overly permissive file settings on macOS, potentially allowing unauthorized access to user accounts. The vulnerability was documented by security research group Teamwin on October 27.



OpenAI had not released a patch as of October 31, when Gartner completed its research.



Separately, cybersecurity firm LayerX Security reported in August the discovery of a vulnerability in Comet called “CometJacking” that could potentially exfiltrate user data to attacker-controlled servers.



OpenAI and Perplexity did not immediately respond to requests for comment.



Years, not months, to mature



The discovered vulnerabilities highlight broader concerns about the maturity of AI browser technology. “Security and privacy must become core design principles rather than afterthoughts,” Mirolyubov said. AI browser vendors must incorporate enterprise-grade cybersecurity controls from the outset and provide greater transparency regarding data flows and agentic decisions, he said.



Emerging AI usage control solutions will likely take “a matter of years rather than months” to mature, he said. “Eliminating all risks is unlikely — erroneous actions by AI agents will remain a concern. Organizations with low risk tolerance may need to block AI browsers for the longer term.”



Organizations with higher risk tolerance that want to experiment should limit pilots to small groups tackling low-risk use cases that are easy to verify and roll back, the Gartner report said. Users must “always closely monitor how the AI browser autonomously navigates when interacting with web resources.”



For now, Gartner said, organizations should block AI browser installations using existing network and endpoint security controls and review their AI policies to ensure that broad use of AI browsers is prohibited.



“Today, most cybersecurity teams choose to block AI browsers, delaying adoption until risks are better understood and controls are more mature,” Mirolyubov said.

Tech's biggest winners of 2025,"Every December, the Engadget staff compiles a list of the year’s biggest winners. We scour over articles from the previous 12 months to determine the people, companies, products and trends that made the most impact over the course of the year. Not all of that influence is positive, however, and some selections may also appear on our list of biggest losers. Still, sit back and enjoy our picks for the biggest winners of 2025.Nintendo Switch 2Playing Mario Kart World on the Switch 2 in handheld mode.Sam Rutherford for EngadgetAside from a big bump in battery life that many were hoping for, Nintendo took just about everything that made its last console such a phenomenon and upgraded it on the Switch 2. A sleeker design with magnetic Joy-Cons that are less likely to break, a larger (albeit LCD) 1080p display with HDR, much stronger performance, mouse controls and a boost to the base storage were all very welcome.Of course, the vast majority of Switch games run on the Switch 2 (often with visual improvements or other upgrades), so the new console had a vast library right from the jump. Nintendo is building out its slate of first-party games with treats like Donkey Kong Bananza and Metroid Prime 4, and the third-party support is seriously impressive too. Cyberpunk 2077, Street Fighter 6 and Hitman: World of Assassination are already available, and the likes of Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade and FromSoftware&#39;s Switch 2 exclusive The Duskbloods are on the way.The Switch 2 is an iteration, not a revolution, but Nintendo didn&#39;t need to reinvent the wheel to make another great system. It&#39;s little surprise, then, that we gave the Switch 2 a score of 93 in our review. The console is surpassing Nintendo&#39;s sales expectations as well. The company said in November that it believes it will sell 19 million units (up from 15 million) by the time its current fiscal year ends in March. — Kris Holt, Contributing reporterNVIDIANVIDIA GeForce 5070 TiDevindra Hardawar for EngadgetCould things be any rosier for NVIDIA? Once just a video card company for gamers, NVIDIA&#39;s GPU hardware is now directly tied to the rise of the AI industry. Its stock has jumped a whopping 1,235 percent over the past five years, going from $13.56 per share in 2020 to a peak of $202.49 this past October. NVIDIA&#39;s server-grade cards are being used en masse to train AI models, as well as to power AI inferencing. At home, its GeForce GPUs are enabling local AI development and they&#39;re still the gaming cards to beat, despite AMD&#39;s steadily improving competition.Clearly, the company&#39;s bet on parallel processing has paid off enormously. Its GPUs can handle tons of computations simultaneously, making them ideally suited for the demands of the AI industry. They&#39;re not exactly efficient — that&#39;s why neural processing units, or NPUs have sprung up to power consumer AI features — but it&#39;s hard to deny NVIDIA&#39;s raw computational power. NVIDIA&#39;s AI success may not last forever, though. Companies like Google and Microsoft are already working on their own AI chips, and it&#39;s still unclear if consumers actually want widespread AI features as much as tech companies think. If the AI industry crashes, NVIDIA will be one of the first victims. — Devindra Hardawar, Senior reporterTech billionairesUS President Donald Trump speaks during a news conference with Elon Musk (L) in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, on May 30, 2025. ALLISON ROBBERT via Getty ImagesThere&#39;s no doubt that tech billionaires, especially those that lean conservatively, have benefitted tremendously from the Trump administration over the past year. Elon Musk&#39;s DOGE team of tech loyalists chainsawed their way through the budgets and staff of several federal agencies, including the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which regulates Tesla. (That hasn&#39;t stopped the NHTSA from launching a new investigation into Tesla&#39;s full self-driving tech, though.)According to a recent report by Oxfam, the 10 richest US billionaires (who are all tech leaders, save for Warren Buffet) increased their wealth by $698 billion of the past year. Of course, it took plenty of wining and dining to get there. Elon Musk reportedly donated nearly $300 million to Trump and Republican allies, and several tech companies have pitched in to build the president&#39;s lavish White House ballroom. But the result for the tech elite is increased access to the president, less scrutiny when it comes to acquisitions and other deals, and the potential for massive corporate and elite tax cuts. — D.H.AI videoPOLAND - 2025/11/26: In this photo illustration, a silhouetted individual is seen holding a mobile phone with a Sora of ChatGPT OpenAI logo displayed in the background. (Photo Illustration by Mateusz Slodkowski/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)SOPA Images via Getty ImagesAI slop didn&#39;t start in 2025, but it reached new heights thanks to updates from Meta, Google, OpenAI and others that made it easier than ever to create a real-ish (emphasis on the ish) looking clips from nothing but your most unhinged mad libs. Now, AI-generated videos are just about impossible to avoid. Some platforms, like Pinterest and TikTok, have even begun offering people the ability to ask their algorithms to show less AI content in their feeds. Unfortunately, there&#39;s no way to stuff Shrimp Jesus back into the bottle. AI video is everywhere and it&#39;s here to stay. It&#39;s not only overtaken Facebook and Instagram&#39;s recommendations, Meta created an entirely separate feed just for users&#39; AI-generated fever dreams. OpenAI&#39;s Sora, which lets you make AI videos of real people, was downloaded a million times in just a few days. Google&#39;s Veo, which generated more than 40 million videos in a matter of weeks, is now built-in to YouTube Shorts.It&#39;s now trivially easy for creators to churn out fake movie trailers, cute animal videos that never happened or viral clips of made up ICE raids. Hell, the president of the United States regularly shares bizarre, sometimes poop-themed, AI videos on his official social media channels. During the government shutdown, the official X account for Senate Republicans shared a deepfake of Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer. AI video is winning not just because it&#39;s everywhere, but because so many are unable, or unwilling, to understand what&#39;s real and what isn&#39;t. More than half of Americans say they are not confident in their ability to distinguish between human and AI-generated content, according to Pew Research. Similar numbers of people report being &#34;more concerned than excited about the increased use of AI in daily life.&#34; But those concerns have done little to stop AI slop from dominating all of our feeds, and there&#39;s no sign it will ever slow down. — Karissa Bell, Senior reporterGalaxy Z Fold 7Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7Sam Rutherford for EngadgetAfter seven generations, Samsung reached an important milestone this year with its Galaxy Z Fold line: It made a foldable phone that’s the same size as a regular handset. In fact, weighing 7.58 ounces and measuring 72.8mm wide, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is actually lighter and narrower than an S25 Ultra, while being practically just as thin at 8.9mm (folded). It’s a real marvel of engineering, especially when you consider the phone also features a 200MP main camera, an IPX8 rating for water resistance and a 5,000 mAh battery with 45-watt wired charging. And of course, there&#39;s that huge 8-inch main screen hiding inside, which makes the Z Fold 7 both a phone and a tablet in one device. The only thing it&#39;s really missing is the improved dust resistance Google gave to the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. But perhaps more importantly, the Z Fold 7&#39;s reduced size and weight have created a device with wider appeal. This has propelled sales of Samsung&#39;s latest flagship foldable up 50 percent compared to the previous generation while pushing shipments of foldables as a whole to record highs. Who knew that when Samsung focuses on creating world-class hardware instead of overindexing on AI, good things happen? Okay, maybe that’s a bit harsh. Regardless, for a phone category that has struggled with excess weight and bulk since its inception, the Z Fold 7 feels like a revelation and the beginning of a new era for handsets with flexible displays. Now, can we just bring their prices down, please? — Sam Rutherford, Senior reporterSmart glassesSenior reporter Karissa Bell wearing a pair of Ray Ban Display glasses. Karissa Bell for EngadgetLike it or not, smart glasses are having a moment. Propelled by new devices like the Meta Ray-Ban Display and upcoming models like Xreal’s Project Aura, the idea of wearing specs with built-in screens suddenly became an attractive proposition. And that means a lot for a category of gadgets that’s often best remembered by the fashion tragedy that was Google Glass in 2013. However, this development isn’t purely by chance. The latest generation of smart glasses has only just now become a reality due to the convergence of several branches of tech — including improved optics, lightweight batteries and, of course, AI. Now that last one might sound silly considering how many big companies seem to be betting the farm on machine learning being the next big thing, but AI will be a critical feature for enabling the hands-free experience that you need to make smartglasses work when you can’t rely on touch input. While this category is still in its early stages of development, the increased momentum we&#39;ve seen from smart glasses this year seems poised to carry them towards being a future pillar of people&#39;s core tech kits. — S.R.Fast chargingFast charging on the Pixel Watch 4 is one implementation that impressed us this year.Cherlynn Low for EngadgetDevices like tablets and smartwatches have matured to the point where each generation mostly sees iterative upgrades, making covering them seem boring. But this year, as the hardware review season came to a close, I noticed an interesting trend. One feature, across various product categories, genuinely excited myself and other reviewers at Engadget and around the internet: impressively fast charging. By itself, high-speed charging isn’t new. But when I reviewed the Pixel Watch 4 in October, I was shocked that one seemingly little update changed how I went about my day. The new power system on Google’s smartwatch was so efficient that after about ten minutes on a cradle, the wearable went from below 20 percent to past 50 percent. With that boost, I stopped having to remind myself to plug the watch in — any time I ran low or was about to run out the door, I just plopped it on the charger and would have enough juice for hours.Google wasn’t the only company to make fast-charging a meaningful addition to one of its 2025 products. Apple’s iPad Pro M5 is the first iPad to support the feature, and while in our testing it fell a little short of the 50 percent charge in 30 minutes that the company promised, our reviewer Nate Ingraham still found it a meaningful improvement.Observers of the smartphone industry will likely point out two things. First, battery technology can be volatile, and larger, faster-charging cells might lead to exploding phones. So my optimism about this development is not without caution. Secondly, we’ve already seen all this come to handsets, especially in phones that launched outside the US first. OnePlus is known for its SUPERVOOC fast charging system, for example, and we’re seeing even more novel battery tech show up abroad. Calling fast charging a winner of 2025 may feel untimely to some.But when you consider the spread of speedier charging to other types of products, especially in electric vehicles that till now take forever to top up, the benefits are clear. This year, we saw Formula E (finally) debut its fast-charging pit stops, Honda announce its first full-size electric motorcycle with fast charging and Chinese EV maker BYD unveiling new tech that delivers peak EV charging speeds of 1,000 kilowatts. That should about halve the time it currently takes to top up your electric car. Sure, it’s not the most eye-catching or novel technological development. But when counted in terms of precious time saved, fast charging coming to more types of devices certainly amounts to a greater good in gadgets in 2025. — Cherlynn Low, Managing editorMagnetsThe Pixel 10 Pro Fold and the Pixel Ring StandSam Rutherford for EngadgetTwo years after the announcement of the Qi 2 wireless charging standard and its support of magnetic attachment accessories (a la Apple’s MagSafe), we’re finally seeing one of the more mainstream Android devices adopt it. In 2025, Google became the first Android phone maker that’s not HMD to do so, bringing such magnetic capabilities to the Pixel 10 series. It also introduced Pixelsnap — its own version of a MagSafe accessory ecosystem, including a slim puck with a fold-out kickstand that you can snap onto a phone. I love the Pixel Ring Stand and make sure to bring it with me whenever I can. It works perfectly with my iPhone 17 Pro, and has a compact footprint that makes it easy to take anywhere. Of course, it’s not the first of its kind — Case-Mate and PopSocket, among others, already make similar products but they’re either pricier or rated poorly. But it’s not just Google that made a magnetic accessory I unexpectedly adored. When reports of Apple’s Crossbody Strap first trickled out, I was underwhelmed. Who cares about a crossbody strap for an iPhone? But when I was presented with one to try at the iPhone 17 launch event, my cynicism quickly melted into desire. Setting aside the convenience of having your phone on your person when you don’t have pockets or a purse, the way magnets play a part here also won me over. To adjust the length of the straps, you just separate the two overlapping pieces that stick together magnetically, move them along each other till you’re satisfied with the length and let them snap back in place. I’m sure Apple isn’t the first to make a crossbody strap accessory for iPhones, nor is it the first to use magnets to adjust such straps. But like many Redditors, I’ve slowly come to realize the differences between those products and the Crossbody Strap for iPhone 17. It’s far from perfect, but in 2025 it was another implementation of magnets in tech that caught my attention and brought convenience to my life. — C.L.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/techs-biggest-winners-of-2025-180000177.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2Fwin25-main.jpg&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=a63327365c5d04dad125a0e990236f8242ceb56c,https://www.engadget.com/techs-biggest-winners-of-2025-180000177.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-08T18:00:00Z,17,Tech
Here's how Google is laying the foundation for our mixed reality future,"Today, during the XR edition of The Android Show, Google showed off a bunch of updates and new features headed to its mixed reality OS. And while most of the news was aimed at developers, I got a chance to demo some of the platform&#39;s expanded capabilities on a range of hardware including Samsung&#39;s Galaxy XR headset, two different reference designs and an early version of Xreal&#39;s Project Aura smart glasses and I came away rather impressed. So here&#39;s a rundown of what I saw and how it will impact the rapidly growing ecosystem of head-mounted displays.First up was one of Google&#39;s reference design smart glasses with a single waveguide RGB display built into its right lens. I&#39;ve included a picture of it here, but try not to read too deeply into its design or aesthetics, as this device is meant to be a testbed for Android XR features and not an early look at upcoming models.Try not to read too much into the appearance of Google&#39;s reference design smart glasses, as they are explicitly labeled as prototypes meant to test upcoming features in Android XR.Sam Rutherford for EngadgetAfter putting them on, I was able to ask Gemini to play some tunes on YouTube Music before answering a call simply by tapping on the touchpad built into the right side of the frames. And because the reference model also had onboard world-facing cameras, I could easily share my view with the person on the other end of the line. Naturally, I was curious about how glasses had the bandwidth to do all this, because in normal use, they rely on a Bluetooth or Bluetooth LE connection. When asked, Max Spear, Group Product Manager for XR, shared that depending on the situation, the device can seamlessly switch between both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, which was rather impressive because I couldn&#39;t even detect when that transition happened. Spear also noted that one of Google&#39;s focuses for Android XR is making it easier for developers to port over the apps people already know and love. This is the picture Google&#39;s reference design smart glasses created (via Gemini ) when I asked it to transform a photo I took of some pantry shelves into a sci-fi kitchen. Sam Rutherford for EngadgetThis means for devices like the reference design I wore that feature a built-in display (or displays), the OS actually uses the same code meant for standard Android notifications (like quick replies) to create a minimalist UI instead of forcing app makers to update each piece of software to be compliant with an ever-increasing number of devices. Alternatively, for models that are super lightweight and rely strictly on speakers (like Bose Frames), Google has also designed Android XR so that you only need mics and voice controls to access a wide variety of apps without the need for visual menus. Meanwhile, if you&#39;re hoping to take photos with your smart glasses, there&#39;s a surprising amount of capability there, too. Not only was I able to ask Gemini to take a photo, the glasses were also able to send a higher-res version to a connected smartwatch, which is super handy in case you want to review the image before moving on to the next shot. And when you want to inject some creativity, you can ask Gemini to transform pictures into practically anything you can imagine via Nano Banana. In my case, I asked the AI to change a shot of a pantry into a sci-fi kitchen and Gemini delivered with aplomb, including converting the room into a metal-clad setting complete with lots of light strips and a few bursts of steam.This is how Google Maps will look on Android XR.  Note that this is the flat 2D version instead of the more detailed stereoscopic view available on smart glasses with dual displays. Sam Rutherford for EngadgetHowever, one of the most impressive demos was when I asked Google&#39;s reference glasses to look at some of that same pantry environment and then use the ingredients to create a recipe based on my specifications (no tomatoes please, my wife isn&#39;t a fan). Gemini went down an Italian route by picking pasta, jarred banana peppers, bell peppers (which I thought was a somewhat unusual combination) and more, before launching into the first steps of the recipe. Sadly, I didn&#39;t have time to actually cook it, but as part of the demo, I learned that Gemini has been trained to understand human-centric gestures like pointing and picking things up. This allows it to better understand context without the need to be super specific, which is one of those little but very impactful tricks that allows AI to feel way less robotic. Then I had a chance to see how Uber and Google Maps ran on the reference glasses, this time using models with both single and dual RGB displays. Surprisingly, even on the monocular version, Maps was able to generate a detailed map with the ability to zoom in and out. But when I switched over to the binocular model, I noticed a significant jump in sharpness and clarity along with a higher-fidelity map with stereoscopic 3D images of buildings. Now, it may be a bit early to call this, and the perception of sharpness varies greatly between people based on their head shape and other factors, but after seeing that, I&#39;m even more convinced that the smart glasses with dual RGB displays are what the industry will settle on in the long term.Even though it was announced not long ago in late October, Samsung&#39;s Galaxy XR headset is already getting some new features thanks to some updates coming to Android XR. Sam Rutherford for EngadgetThe second type of device I used was the Samsung Galaxy XR, which I originally tried out when it was announced back in October. However, in the short time since, Google has cooked up a few new features that really help expand the headset&#39;s capabilities. By using the goggle&#39;s exterior-facing cameras, I was able to play a game of I Spy with Gemini. Admittedly, this might sound like a small addition, but I think it&#39;s going to play a big part in how we use devices running Android XR, because it allows the headset (or glasses) to understand better what you&#39;re looking at in order to provide more helpful contextual responses. However, the biggest surprise was when I joined a virtual call with someone using one of Google&#39;s new avatars, called Likeness. Instead of the low-polygon cartoony characters we&#39;ve seen before in places like Meta Horizon, Google&#39;s virtual representations of people&#39;s faces are almost scary good. So good I had to double-check that they weren&#39;t real and from what I&#39;ve seen they&#39;re even a step up from Apple&#39;s Personas. Google says that headsets like the Galaxy XR rely on interior sensors to track and respond to facial movements, while users will be able to create and edit their avatars using a standalone app due out sometime next year. The person in the bottom right is using a Likeness, which during my demo looked surprisingly responsive and realistic. GoogleNext, I got a chance to test out the Android XR&#39;s PC connectivity by playing Stray on the Galaxy XR while it was tethered wirelessly to a nearby laptop. Not only did it run almost flawlessly with low latency, I was also able to use a paired controller instead of relying on hand-tracking or the laptop&#39;s mouse and keyboard. This is something I&#39;ve been eagerly waiting to try because it feels like Google has put a lot of work into making Android XR devices play nicely with other devices and OSes. Initially, you&#39;ll only be able to connect Windows PCs to the Galaxy XR, but Google says it&#39;s looking to support macOS systems as well.Finally, I got to try out Xreal&#39;s Project Aura glasses to see how Android XR works on a device primarily designed to give you big virtual displays in a portable form factor. Unfortunately, because this was a pre-production unit, I wasn&#39;t able to take photos. That said, as far as the glasses go, I was really impressed with their resolution and sharpness and the inclusion of electrochromic glass is a really nice touch, as it allows users to change how heavily the lenses are tinted with a single touch. Alternatively, the glasses can also adjust the tint automatically based on whatever app you are using to give you a more or less isolated atmosphere, depending on the situation. I also appreciate the Aura&#39;s increased 70-degree FOV, but if I&#39;m nitpicking, I wish it were a bit higher, as I occasionally found myself wanting a bit more vertical display area. Unfortunately, I wasn&#39;t allowed to take photos of Xreal&#39;s Project Aura smart glasses, as the model I used was still an early pre-production unit. So here&#39;s a shot provided by Google instead. Google / XrealAs a device that&#39;s sort of between lightweight smart glasses and a full VR headset, the Aura relies on a wired battery pack that also doubles as a touchpad and a hub for plugging in external devices like your phone, laptop or even game consoles. While using the Aura, I was able to connect to a different PC and multitask in style, as the glasses were able to support multiple virtual displays while running several different apps at the same time. This allowed me to be on a virtual call with someone using a Likeness while I had two other virtual windows open on either side. I also played an AR game (Demio) while I moved around in virtual space and used my hands to reposition the battlefield or pick up objects with my hands. Now I will fully admit this is a lot and it took me a bit to process everything. But upon reflection, I have a few takeaways from my time with the various Android XR devices and prototypes. More than any other headset or smart glasses platform out now, it feels like Google is doing a ton to embrace a growing ecosystem of devices. That&#39;s really important because we&#39;re still so early in the lifecycle for wearable gadgets with displays that no one has really figured out a truly polished design like we have for smartphones and laptops. And until we get there, this means that a highly adaptable OS will go a long way towards supporting OEMs like Samsung, Xreal and others. But that&#39;s not all. It&#39;s clear Google is focused on making Android XR devices easy to build for. That&#39;s because the company knows that without useful software that can highlight the components and features coming on next-gen spectacles, there&#39;s a chance that interest will remain rather niche — similar to what we&#39;ve seen when looking at the adoption of VR headsets. So in a way, Google is waging a battle on two fronts, which makes navigating uncharted waters that much more difficult. A major focus for Android XR while people are still figuring out how to make smart glasses is to support a wide variety of designs including those with single displays, dual displays or models without any displays that rely on cameras and speakers. Sam Rutherford for EngadgetGoogle is putting a major emphasis on Android XR&#39;s ability to serve as a framework for future gadgets and support and address developer needs. This mirrors the approach the company takes with regular Android and the opposite of Apple&#39;s typical MO, because unlike the Vision Pro and visionOS, it appears Google is going to rely heavily on its partners like Xreal, Warby Parker, Gentle Monster and others to create engaging hardware. Furthermore, Google says it plans to support smart glasses that can be tethered to Android and iOS phones, as well as smartwatches from both ecosystems, though there will be some limitations for people using Apple devices due to inherent OS restrictions. That&#39;s not to say that there won&#39;t be Pixel glasses sometime down the road, but at least for now, I think that&#39;s a smart approach and possibly a lesson Google learned after releasing Google Glass over a decade ago. Meanwhile, hi-res and incredibly realistic avatars like Likenesses could be a turning point for virtual collaboration, because, in a first for me, talking to a digital representation of someone else felt kind of natural. After my demos, I had a chance to talk to Senior Director of Product Management for XR Juston Payne, who highlighted the difference between smart glasses and typical gadgets by saying &#34;Smart glasses have to be great glasses first. They need to have a good form factor, good lenses with prescription support, they need to look good and they have to be easy to buy.&#34;That&#39;s no simple task and there&#39;s no guarantee that next-gen smart glasses and headsets will be a grand slam. But from what I&#39;ve seen, Google is building a very compelling foundation with Android XR.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/heres-how-google-is-laying-the-foundation-for-our-mixed-reality-future-180000716.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2Fgoogle-reference-design-lead.jpg&resize=1400%2C840&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=dcd5d965d2bb5c18600a5ad01f25fb76299954ae,https://www.engadget.com/wearables/heres-how-google-is-laying-the-foundation-for-our-mixed-reality-future-180000716.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-08T18:00:00Z,12,Tech

Uber will start selling trip and takeout data to marketers,"Uber will begin selling customer data to marketers, according to a report by Business Insider. The company&#39;s ad division just launched a new insights platform called Uber Intelligence that&#39;s tasked with hoovering up and selling trip and delivery data.
The data will technically be anonymous, via the use of a platform called LiveRamp. This will &#34;let advertisers securely combine their customer data with Uber&#39;s to help surface insights about their audiences, based on what they eat and where they travel.&#34;
Basically, it&#39;ll provide a broad view of local consumer trends based on collected data. Uber gives an example of a hotel brand using the technology to identify which restaurants or venues to partner with according to rideshare information.
The company also says it&#39;s planning on using this tech to directly advertise to consumers, saying it could be used to identify customers who are &#34;heavy business travelers&#34; and then plague them with ads in the app or in vehicles during their next trip to the airport. Fun times.
&#34;That seamlessness is why we&#39;re so excited,&#34; Edwin Wong, global head of measurement at Uber Advertising, told Business Insider. Uber has stated that its ad business is already on track to generate $1.5 billion in revenue this year, and that&#39;s before implementing these changes.
As for Uber in totality, the company made $44 billion in 2024, which was a jump from $37 billion in 2023. It&#39;s also notorious for raising fares. Uber has raised prices for consumers by around 18 percent each year since 2018, which has outpaced inflation by up to four times in some markets.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/uber-will-start-selling-trip-and-takeout-data-to-marketers-171011769.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F5bfa0a20-d454-11f0-bb2d-2f4155366e78&resize=1400%2C877&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=60e589a5f3ab370bcf0522c4887643391695beee,https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/uber-will-start-selling-trip-and-takeout-data-to-marketers-171011769.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-08T17:10:11Z,7,Tech

Best Guess Live is Netflix's take on HQ Trivia,"Netflix has already committed to reviving Star Search for its streaming service, and now the company is turning its attention to a different type of live show: HQ Trivia. Netflix&#39;s Best Guess Live is an attempt to revive the late 2010s app-based show with what the company is calling its first &#34;weekday mobile game show.&#34;Best Guess Live will be hosted by Howie Mandel (Deal or No Deal, America&#39;s Got Talent) and Hunter March (Sugar Rush) and will broadcast Monday through Friday at 8PM ET / 5PM PT. The game seems like it will lean on multiple choice questions much like HQ Trivia did, and will reward players who answer the fastest and play multiple times per week. Netflix&#39;s announcement doesn&#39;t have any specifics as to how much money will be up for grabs, but the company does promise to give away &#34;thousands of dollars in prize money.&#34;HQ Trivia, started by Vine co-founders Rus Yusupov and Colin Kroll, was a surprise hit when it debuted in 2017, thanks in part to its host Scott Rogowsky and the appointment-viewing nature of a daily game show you could watch on your phone. The later slow collapse of HQ was rocky enough to warrant a CNN documentary, but clearly the concept of the app fits nicely with Netflix&#39;s growing interest in live shows and casual games.Netflix has experimented with a growing number of live shows, including talk shows and sports programming. The company has also recently abandoned its aspirations to develop AAA games and ambitious indie titles to focus on casual experiences and games based on Netflix IP. Best Guess Live seems like a nice fusion of casual interactive experience and lightweight live content. Many people already open the Netflix app daily to find something to watch.

The developer behind ICEBlock is suing the federal government,"The makers of ICEBlock, the community-based reporting app for ICE sightings and activity, are suing the federal government, alleging &#34;unlawful threats&#34; made by Trump administration officials led to the app&#39;s removal from app stores. The suit centers on free speech violations and accuses the administration of coercing Apple into taking down the app in October. Google began taking down similar apps around the same time.
Josh Aaron developed ICEBlock in response to the Trump administration&#39;s crackdown on illegal immigration. The app allowed users to pin ICE agent locations on a map as well as add notes such as what agents were wearing or the kind of vehicle they were driving. The app would then alert users within a five-mile radius of the sighting. The White House called the app &#34;an incitement of further violence against… ICE officers&#34; and sought its removal.
“A lesson we should all take from this is when we see our government is doing something wrong, it is our duty to stand up,” Aaron told the New York Times.
This isn&#39;t the first time Apple has faced controversy for an app takedown. In 2019, the company removed an app that protesters in Hong Kong were using to track police after facing pressure from the Chinese government.
Apple, for its part, said it took the app down in response to &#34;information we&#39;ve received from law enforcement about the safety risks associated with ICEBlock.&#34; Federal officials said the gunman who attacked an ICE facility in Dallas had used tracking apps, including ICEBlock.
&#34;Fundamentally, ICEBlock neither enables nor encourages confrontation — it simply delivers time-limited location information to help users stay aware of their surroundings in a responsible and nonviolent way,&#34; Aaron&#39;s suit reads.

Paramount makes a $108 billion hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros. Discovery,"Paramount has been none too pleased about Netflix striking an $82.7 billion deal to buy much of Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD). Now, Paramount is making a hostile takeover bid for WBD. It&#39;s making its pitch directly to WBD shareholders with an all-cash offer of $30 per share that expires on January 8.Late last week, the WBD board unanimously accepted Netflix&#39;s offer of $27.75 per share. That breaks down to $23.25 per share in cash and another $4.50 per share in Netflix stock. Netflix&#39;s overall bid is valued at $82.7 billion, while Paramount&#39;s totals $108.4 billion. There&#39;s a key difference when it comes to the Paramount offer, as it’s for all of WBD. The latter is scheduled to split into two companies next year. Netflix only wants the Streaming and Studios side of WBD&#39;s business, which includes HBO Max and the Warner Bros. film, TV and game studios. Paramount is after the whole shebang, including WBD&#39;s cable channels (Global Networks). &#34;WBD&#39;s Board of Directors recommendation of the Netflix transaction over Paramount&#39;s offer is based on an illusory prospective valuation of Global Networks that is unsupported by the business fundamentals and encumbered by high levels of financial leverage assigned to the entity,&#34; Paramount said in a press release on Monday. As of the end of September, WBD was carrying $34.5 billion of gross debt. It planned to saddle the Global Networks company (aka Discovery Global) with most of that. The Paramount offer includes financing from the Ellison family and RedBird Capital, but it would be taking on more debt to secure a deal for WBD. The bid includes &#34;$54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo&#34; (Engadget&#39;s parent company). In a letter sent to WBD CEO David Zazlav before the company accepted Netflix&#39;s offer, Paramount questioned the &#34;fairness and adequacy&#34; of the sale process. It asked whether WBD was acting in the best interest of shareholders after the management team allegedly appeared to favor the Netflix offer.&#34;Despite Paramount submitting six proposals over the course of 12 weeks, WBD never engaged meaningfully with these proposals which we believe deliver the best outcome for WBD shareholders,&#34; Paramount said. &#34;Paramount has now taken its offer directly to WBD shareholders and its Board of Directors to ensure they have the opportunity to pursue this clearly superior alternative.&#34;Paramount — which Skydance bought for $8 billion this year — also claims that its offer is likely to face less regulatory scrutiny than the Netflix offer, which wouldn&#39;t close until sometime after WBD splits in two later in 2026. According to CNBC, Paramount executives believe that the company&#39;s smaller size and cozy relationship with the Trump administration will help streamline the regulatory process. Over the weekend, President Donald Trump said that Netflix&#39;s bid for WBD has &#34;got to go through a process, and we’ll see what happens. But it is a big market share. It could be a problem.&#34;This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/paramount-makes-a-108-billion-hostile-takeover-bid-for-warner-bros-discovery-152248473.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2F2025-12%2F9a91675e-0ba7-4cd2-b680-39448542deaa&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=1c9030deeaf87f1f1827313db70e572c4f92b0f0,https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/paramount-makes-a-108-billion-hostile-takeover-bid-for-warner-bros-discovery-152248473.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-08T15:22:48Z,7,Tech

Blink budget security cameras will support AI-powered video descriptions,"Amazon&#39;s budget Blink smart home brand is adding AI-generated video descriptions as a new benefit for subscribers. Blink Video Descriptions are text descriptions of the motion doorbells and cameras capture, and they’ll be available in beta starting today, November 17.Not unlike Ring Video Descriptions, a feature offered on Amazon&#39;s other smart home brand, Blink&#39;s AI-generated descriptions are supposed to be a concise way to check out what&#39;s happening in and around your home. Any kind of motion can produce a video clip and a notification in the Blink app, but video descriptions should help weed out which ones are worth watching and worrying about.Blink says Video Descriptions will be supported on all existing Blink doorbells and cameras, provided you&#39;re paying to be a Blink subscriber for at least $4 a month or $40 a year. That means if you&#39;ve scooped up one of the new Blink 2K+, Blink Outdoor 2K+ or Blink Arc cameras, you&#39;ll be able to take advantage of the feature.Blink Video Descriptions start rolling out to subscribers today in beta, though not in Illinois, possibly due to the state&#39;s Biometric Information Privacy Act.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/blink-budget-security-cameras-will-support-ai-powered-video-descriptions-143000725.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2FBlink-Arc.jpg&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=5dc06053a7db0a48fb2adbde426207f9b79934cd,https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/blink-budget-security-cameras-will-support-ai-powered-video-descriptions-143000725.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-08T14:30:00Z,7,Tech

The Google Pixel Watch 4 is cheaper than ever right now,"Cyber Monday has come and gone, but you can still get a great deal on a smartwatch with the Google Pixel Watch 4 marked down to $300 from $350. At almost 15 percent off, this is the lowest we&#39;ve ever seen it. 

  
The Pixel Watch 4 was just released in October and is our smartwatch of choice for users with Pixel phones. In our hands-on review we scored it 86 out of 100, taking note of its fast recharge time, health and fitness tracking, repairable design and gorgeous display. 
The curved display sits under a domed glass cover and sports an impressive 3,000 nits of peak brightness, well beyond the 2,000 nits max of the Apple Watch Series 11. This makes the Pixel Watch 4 about 50 percent brighter than the previous generation, and thanks to smaller bezels the display is about 10 percent bigger. 
The new generation also adds dual-frequency GPS, updated processors and a custom haptic engine. It also boasts a more repairable design thanks to a case that can be easily unscrewed to replace the display or battery. We did find the gesture based raise-to-talk Gemini feature a little gimmicky, and users should note that the watch must be connected to the internet for Gemini to work. 
Thanks to all this, we named the Pixel Watch 4 the best smartwatch for Android users. It&#39;s as good a workout companion as a daily watch and offers peace of mind with emergency SOS via satellite. If you&#39;re an Android user in the market for a smartwatch, this is one of the best deals available now.

Apple Watch Series 11 drops $100 to an all-time low price,"Sure, Black Friday and Cyber Monday have come and gone, but you can still find a last-minute deal on the best tech gifts. Take the Apple Watch Series 11, which has dropped to an all-time low of $299, from $399. The 25 percent discount is an even better deal than we saw on either of those sale holidays.  
We gave the Apple Watch Series 11 a score of 90 when it came out in September. That&#39;s thanks, in part, to an upgraded 24 hours of battery life — which lasted closer to a day and a half — compared to the 18 hours promised by the Series 10. It also features a thin, light design and a wrist flick gesture for everything from dismissing a notification to ending calls. Plus, it has Apple&#39;s new hypertension tracker and comprehensive health monitoring.

Trump says if Netflix buys Warner Bros. its market share 'could be a problem',"After Netflix announced that it was acquiring Warner Bros. Discovery last week, observers immediatley wondered when or if the deal could obtain regulatory approval. Now, President Trump has made comments indicating that said approval is likely to take awhile if it happens at all, Bloomberg reported. 
&#34;Well, that’s got to go through a process, and we’ll see what happens,&#34; Trump told reporters in a recent Q&amp;A scrum. &#34;But it is a big market share. It could be a problem.&#34; The President added that he will be personally involved in the approval process. 
As we pointed out last week, Netflix and HBO Max combined would account for around 33 percent of the US streaming video market, ahead of Prime Video&#39;s 21 percent share and likely enough to attract the antitrust division of the US Justice Department. For its part, Netflix has said that it will &#34;maintain Warner Bros. current businesses,&#34; which includes HBO Max and HBO, theatrical releases for films as well as movie and TV studio operations. 
Headwinds were likely with any deal, so in November Netflix&#39;s co-CEO Ted Sarandos reportedly met with Trump at the White House, arguing that the acquisition wouldn&#39;t create a monopoly. Trump said that Warner Bros. Discovery should sell to the highest bidder, and Sarandos left the meeting feeling that Netflix wouldn&#39;t face White House opposition in the short term.
Even before regulators address the acquisition, more drama may ensue. Paramount, which first expressed interested in buying WBD when it wasn&#39;t even for sale, may launch a hostile bid. And Hollywood&#39;s unions and guilds are up in arms over fears that Netflix may significantly reduce Warner Bros.&#39; theatrical distribution, along with its back end profits and production jobs. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/trump-says-if-netflix-buys-warner-bros-its-market-share-could-be-a-problem-123004774.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F42c46740-d408-11f0-af5b-f5359256bd7d&resize=1400%2C700&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=f681c8a2eaff95081566c37a8db99b3719848645,https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/trump-says-if-netflix-buys-warner-bros-its-market-share-could-be-a-problem-123004774.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-08T12:00:04Z,10,Tech

Apple's AirPods Pro 3 are back to an all-time low price,"If you haven&#39;t yet upgraded to Apple&#39;s AirPods Pro 3, you can pick up the company&#39;s latest model at a discount through a deal on Amazon right now. The AirPods Pro 3, which came out in September, are currently down from $249 to $220 — their Cyber Monday all-time low price. With the new AirPods Pro, Apple made some big improvements, including better battery life and sound quality, and introduced useful new features, such as Live Translation. 

  
The AirPods Pro 3 are the best AirPods available today, with Apple&#39;s H2 chip, and earned a score of 90 out of 100 in Engadget&#39;s review this fall. Active noise cancellation (ANC) is one of the biggest selling points of the AirPods Pro, and Apple has made the experience even better with the AirPods Pro 3. They sport new foam-infused ear tips that create a better seal to improve passive noise isolation, and as Engadget&#39;s Billy Steele wrote in his review, &#34;Ultra-low-noise microphones combine with advanced computational audio to silence even more background noise.&#34; In testing, they had no problem blocking out the chatter of people nearby or otherwise noisy environments. 
With the AirPods Pro 3, Apple introduced heart-rate sensing, so you&#39;ll be able to see your heart rate data from the earbuds in the Fitness app and other workout apps. The AirPods Pro 3 also boast Live Translation, which you can activate via controls on the earbuds themselves. As long as you have an Apple Intelligence-capable device, you&#39;ll be able to translate in-person conversations in English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish and Chinese (Mandarin).

The 5 best Mint alternatives to replace the budgeting app that shut down,"It&#39;s been over one year since Intuit shut down the popular budgeting app Mint. I was a Mint user for many years; millions of other users like me enjoyed how easily Mint allowed us to track all accounts in one place and monitor credit scores. I also used it regularly to help me track spending, set goals like pay my mortgage down faster and with general money management.Ahead of Mint’s demise, I gave Credit Karma, Intuit’s other financial app, a try but found it to be a poor Mint alternative. So I set out to find a true replacement in another budgeting app. The following guide lays out my experience testing some of the most popular Mint replacement apps available today. Our pick for best Mint alternative remains Quicken Simplifi, even this long after Mint being shut down, thanks to its easy to use app, good income and bill detection and its affordable price. But there are plenty of other solid options out there for those with different needs. If you’re also on the hunt for a budgeting app to replace Mint, we hope these details can empower you to choose which of the best budgeting apps out there will be right for you.

No pun intended, but what I like about Quicken Simplifi is its simplicity. Whereas other budgeting apps try to distinguish themselves with dark themes and customizable emoji, Simplifi has a clean user interface, with a landing page that you just keep scrolling through to get a detailed overview of all your stats. These include your top-line balances; net worth; recent spending; upcoming recurring payments; a snapshot of your spending plan; top spending categories; achievements; and any watchlists you’ve set up. 
Another one of the key features I appreciate is the ability to set up savings goals elsewhere in the app. I also appreciate how it offers neat, almost playful visualizations without ever looking cluttered. I felt at home in the mobile and web dashboards after a day or so, which is faster than I adapted to some competing services (I’m looking at you, YNAB and Monarch). 
Getting set up with Simplifi was mostly painless. I was particularly impressed at how easily it connected to Fidelity; not all budget trackers do, for whatever reason. This is also one of the only services I tested that gives you the option of inviting a spouse or financial advisor to co-manage your account. One thing I would add to my initial assessment of the app, having used it for a few months now: I wish Simplifi offered Zillow integration for easily tracking your home value (or at least a rough estimate of it). Various competitors including Monarch Money and Copilot Money work with Zillow, so clearly there&#39;s a Zillow API available for use. As it stands, Simplifi users must add real estate manually like any other asset.

In practice, Simplifi miscategorized some of my expenses, but nothing out of the ordinary compared to any of these budget trackers. As you’re reviewing transactions, you can also mark if you’re expecting a refund, which is a unique feature among the services I tested. Simplifi also estimated my regular income better than some other apps I tested. Most of all, I appreciated the option of being able to categorize some, but not all, purchases from a merchant as recurring. For instance, I can add my two Amazon subscribe-and-saves as recurring payments, without having to create a broad-strokes rule for every Amazon purchase. 
The budgeting feature is also self-explanatory and can likely accommodate your preferred budgeting method. Just check that your regular income is accurate and be sure to set up recurring payments, making note of which are bills and which are subscriptions. This is important because Simplifi shows you your total take-home income as well as an “income after bills” figure. That number includes, well, bills but not discretionary subscriptions. From there, you can add spending targets by category in the “planned spending” bucket. Planned spending can also include one-time expenditures, not just monthly budgets. When you create a budget, Simplifi will suggest a number based on a six-month average. 
Not dealbreakers, but two things to keep in mind as you get started: Simplifi is notable in that you can’t set up an account through Apple or Google. There is also no option for a free trial, though Quicken promises a “30-day money back guarantee.” 

  
Monarch Money grew on me. My first impression of the budgeting app, which was founded by a former Mint product manager, was that it&#39;s more difficult to use than others on this list, including Simplifi, NerdWallet and Copilot. And it is. Editing expense categories, adding recurring transactions and creating rules, for example, is a little more complicated than it needs to be, especially in the mobile app. (My advice: Use the web app for fine-tuning details.) Monarch also didn’t get my income right; I had to edit it. 
Once you’re set up, though, Monarch offers an impressive level of granularity. In the budgets section, you can see a bona fide balance sheet showing budgets and actuals for each category. You&#39;ll also find a forecast, for the year or by month. And recurring expenses can be set not just by merchant, but other parameters as well. For instance, while most Amazon purchases might be marked as “shopping,” those for the amounts of $54.18 or $34.18 are definitely baby supplies, and can be automatically marked as such each time, not to mention programmed as recurring payments. Weirdly, though, there’s no way to mark certain recurring payments as bills, specifically.

Not long after I first published this story in December 2023, Monarch introduced a detailed reporting section where you can create on-demand graphs based on things like accounts, categories and tags. That feature is available just on the web version of the app for now. As part of this same update, Monarch added support for an aggregator that makes it possible to automatically update the value of your car. This, combined with the existing Zillow integration for tracking your home value, makes it easy to quickly add a non-liquid asset like a vehicle or real estate, and have it show up in your net worth graph. 
The mobile app is mostly self-explanatory. The main dashboard shows your net worth; your four most recent transactions; a month-over-month spending comparison; income month-to-date; upcoming bills; an investments snapshot; a list of any goals you’ve set; and, finally, a link to your month-in-review. That month-in-review is more detailed than most, delving into cash flow; top income and expense categories; cash flow trends; changes to your net worth, assets and liabilities; plus asset and liability breakdowns. In February 2024, Monarch expanded on the net worth graph, so that if you click on the Accounts tab you can see how your net worth changed over different periods of time, including one month, three months, six months, a year or all time. 
On the main screen, you’ll also find tabs for savings and checking accounts (and all others as well), transactions, cash flow, budget and recurring. Like many of the other apps featured here, Monarch can auto-detect recurring expenses and income, even if it gets the category wrong. (They all do to an extent.) Expense categories are marked by emoji, which you can customize if you’re so inclined. 
Monarch Money uses a combination of networks to connect with banks, including Plaid, MX and Finicity, a competing network owned by Mastercard. (I have a quick explainer on Plaid, the industry standard in this space, toward the end of this guide.) As part of an update in late December, Monarch has also made it easier to connect through those other two networks, if for some reason Plaid fails. Similar to NerdWallet, I found myself completing two-factor authentication every time I wanted to get past the Plaid screen to add another account. Notably, Monarch is the only other app I tested that allows you to grant access to someone else in your family — likely a spouse or financial advisor. Monarch also has a Chrome extension for importing from Mint, though really this is just a shortcut for downloading a CSV file, which you’ll have to do regardless of where you choose to take your Mint data. 
Additionally, Monarch just added the ability to track Apple Card, Apple Cash, and Savings accounts, thanks to new functionality brought with the iOS 17.4 update. It&#39;s not the only one either; currently, Copilot and YNAB have also added similar functionality that will be available to anyone with the latest versions of their respective apps on a device running iOS 17.4. Instead of manually uploading statements, the new functionality allows apps like Monarch&#39;s to automatically pull in transactions and balance history. That should make it easier to account for spending on Apple cards and accounts throughout the month. 
Monarch also recently launched investment transactions in beta. It also says bill tracking and an overhauled goals system are coming soon. Monarch hasn&#39;t provided a timeline for that last one, except to say that the improved goals feature is coming soon. 

  
Copilot Money might be the best-looking budgeting app I tested. It also has the distinction of being exclusive to iOS and Macs — at least for now. Andres Ugarte, the company’s CEO, has publicly promised that Android and web apps are coming soon. But until it follows through, I can’t recommend Copilot for most people with so many good competitors out there. 

 
  Copilot Money for Web and Android!Thanks to the support from our users, and the overwhelming positive reception we&#39;re seeing from folks migrating from Mint, we can now say that we&#39;ll be building @copilotmoney for Web and Android with a goal to launch in 2024.We&#39;ll continue to…— Andres Ugarte (@chuga) November 15, 2023
  
 
There are other features that Copilot is missing, which I’ll get into. But it is promising, and one to keep an eye on. It’s just a fast, efficient, well designed app, and Android users will be in for a treat when they’ll finally be able to download it. It makes good use of colors, emoji and graphs to help you understand at a glance how you’re doing on everything from your budgets to your investment performance to your credit card debt over time. In particular, Copilot does a better job than almost any other app of visualizing your recurring monthly expenses. 
Behind those punchy colors and cutesy emoji, though, is some sophisticated performance. Copilot’s AI-powered “Intelligence” gets smarter as you go at categorizing your expenses. (You can also add your own categories, complete with your choice of emoji.) It’s not perfect. Copilot miscategorized some purchases (they all do), but it makes it easier to edit than most. On top of that, the internal search feature is very fast; it starts whittling down results in your transaction history as soon as you begin typing. 

 
 
 
  Dana Wollman / Engadget
 
 
Copilot is also unique in offering Amazon and Venmo integrations, allowing you to see transaction details. With Amazon, this requires just signing into your Amazon account via an in-app browser. For Venmo, you have to set up fwd@copilot.money as a forwarding address and then create a filter, wherein emails from venmo@venmo.com are automatically forwarded to fwd@copilot.money. Like Monarch Money, you can also add any property you own and track its value through Zillow, which is integrated with the app. 
While the app is heavily automated, I still appreciate that Copilot marks new transactions for review. It’s a good way to both weed out fraudulent charges, and also be somewhat intentional about your spending habits. 
Like Monarch Money, Copilot updated its app to make it easier to connect to banks through networks other than Plaid. As part of the same update, Copilot said it has improved its connections to both American Express and Fidelity which, again, can be a bugbear for some budget tracking apps. In an even more recent update, Copilot added a Mint import option, which other budgeting apps have begun to offer as well. 
Because the app is relatively new (it launched in early 2020), the company is still catching up to the competition on some table-stakes features. Ugarte told me that his team is almost done building out a detailed cash flow section as well. On its website, Copilot also promises a raft of AI-powered features that build on its current “Intelligence” platform, the one that powers its smart expense categorization. These include “smart financial goals,” natural language search, a chat interface, forecasting and benchmarking. That benchmarking, Ugarte tells me, is meant to give people a sense of how they’re doing compared to other Copilot users, on both spending and investment performance. Most of these features should arrive in the new year. 
Copilot does a couple interesting things for new customers that distinguish it from the competition. There’s a “demo mode” that feels like a game simulator; no need to add your own accounts. The company is also offering two free months with RIPMINT — a more generous introductory offer than most. When it finally does come time to pony up, the $7.92 monthly plan is cheaper than some competing apps, although the $95-a-year-option is in the same ballpark. 

  
 
You may know NerdWallet as a site that offers a mix of personal finance news, explainers and guides. I see it often when I google a financial term I don’t know and sure enough, it’s one of the sites I’m most likely to click on. As it happens, NerdWallet also has the distinction of offering one of the only free budgeting apps I tested. In fact, there is no paid version; nothing is locked behind a paywall. The main catch: There are ads everywhere. To be fair, the free version of Mint was like this, too. 
Even with the inescapable credit card offers, NerdWallet has a clean, easy-to-understand user interface, which includes both a web and a mobile app. The key metrics that it highlights most prominently are your cash flow, net worth and credit score. (Of note, although Mint itself offered credit score monitoring, most of its rivals do not.) I particularly enjoyed the weekly insights, which delve into things like where you spent the most money or how much you paid in fees — and how that compares to the previous month. Because this is NerdWallet, an encyclopedia of financial info, you get some particularly specific category options when setting up your accounts (think: a Roth or non-Roth IRA). 

 
 
 
  Dana Wollman / Engadget
 
 
As a budgeting app, NerdWallet is more than serviceable, if a bit basic. Like other apps I tested, you can set up recurring bills. Importantly, it follows the popular 50/30/20 budgeting rule, which has you putting 50% of your budget toward things you need, 30% toward things you want, and the remaining 20% into savings or debt repayments. If this works for you, great — just know that you can’t customize your budget to the same degree as some competing apps. You can’t currently create custom spending categories, though a note inside the dashboard section of the app says “you’ll be able to customize them in the future.” You also can’t move items from the wants column to “needs” or vice versa but “In the future, you&#39;ll be able to move specific transactions to actively manage what falls into each group.” A NerdWallet spokesperson declined to provide an ETA, though. 
Lastly, it’s worth noting that NerdWallet had one of the most onerous setup processes of any app I tested. I don’t think this is a dealbreaker, as you’ll only have to do it once and, hopefully, you aren’t setting up six or seven apps in tandem as I was. What made NerdWallet’s onboarding especially tedious is that every time I wanted to add an account, I had to go through a two-factor authentication process to even get past the Plaid splash screen, and that’s not including the 2FA I had set up at each of my banks. This is a security policy on NerdWallet’s end, not Plaid’s, a Plaid spokesperson says. 
Precisely because NerdWallet is one of the only budget trackers to offer credit score monitoring, it also needs more of your personal info during setup, including your birthday, address, phone number and the last four digits of your social security number. It’s the same with Credit Karma, which also does credit score monitoring. 
Related to the setup process, I found that NerdWallet was less adept than other apps at automatically detecting my regular income. In my case, it counted a large one-time wire transfer as income, at which point my only other option was to enter my income manually (which is slightly annoying because I would have needed my pay stub handy to double-check my take-home pay). 

  
YNAB is, by its own admission, “different from anything you’ve tried before.” The app, whose name is short for You Need a Budget, promotes a so-called zero-based budgeting system, which forces you to assign a purpose for every dollar you earn. A frequently used analogy is to put each dollar in an envelope; you can always move money from one envelope to another in a pinch. These envelopes can include rent and utilities, along with unforeseen expenses like holiday gifts and the inevitable car repair. The idea is that if you budget a certain amount for the unknowns each month, they won’t feel like they’re sneaking up on you. 
Importantly, YNAB is only concerned with the money you have in your accounts now. The app does not ask you to provide your take-home income or set up recurring income payments (although there is a way to do this). The money you will make later in the month through your salaried job is not relevant, because YNAB does not engage in forecasting. 
The app is harder to learn than any other here, and it requires more ongoing effort from the user. And YNAB knows that. Inside both the mobile and web apps are links to videos and other tutorials. Although I never quite got comfortable with the user interface, I did come to appreciate YNAB’s insistence on intentionality. Forcing users to draft a new budget each month and to review each transaction is not necessarily a bad thing. As YNAB says on its website, “Sure, you’ve got pie charts showing that you spent an obscene amount of money in restaurants — but you’ve still spent an obscene amount of money in restaurants.” I can see this approach being useful for people who don’t tend to have a lot of cash in reserve at a given time, or who have spending habits they want to correct (to riff off of YNAB’s own example, ordering Seamless four times a week). 
My colleague Valentina Palladino, knowing I was working on this guide, penned a respectful rebuttal, explaining why she’s been using YNAB for years. Perhaps, like her, you have major savings goals you want to achieve, whether it’s paying for a wedding or buying a house. I suggest you give her column a read. For me, though, YNAB’s approach feels like overkill. 
Other Mint alternatives we tested 
PocketGuard 
PocketGuard used to be a solid free budget tracker, but the company has since limited its “free” version to just a free seven-day trial. Now, you’ll have to choose between two plans once the trial is over: a $13 monthly plan or a $75 annual plan. When I first tested it, I found it to be more restricted than NerdWallet, but still a decent option. The main overview screen shows you your net worth, total assets and debts; net income and total spending for the month; upcoming bills; a handy reminder of when your next paycheck lands; any debt payoff plan you have; and any goals. Like some other apps, including Quicken Simplifi, PocketGuard promotes an “after bills” approach, where you enter all of your recurring bills, and then PocketGuard shows you what’s left, and that’s what you’re supposed to be budgeting: your disposable income. 
Although PocketGuard’s UI is easy enough to understand, it lacks polish. The “accounts” tab is a little busy, and doesn’t show totals for categories like cash or investments. Seemingly small details like weirdly phrased or punctuated copy occasionally make the app feel janky. More than once, it prompted me to update the app when no updates were available. The web version, meanwhile, feels like the mobile app blown up to a larger format and doesn’t take advantage of the extra screen real estate. Ultimately, now that the free tier is gone, it just doesn’t present the same value proposition as it once did. 
What is Plaid and how does it work? 

 
 
 
Each of the apps I tested uses the same underlying network, called Plaid, to pull in financial data, so it’s worth explaining in its own section what it is and how it works. Plaid was founded as a fintech startup in 2013 and is today the industry standard in connecting banks with third-party apps. Plaid works with over 12,000 financial institutions across the US, Canada and Europe. Additionally, more than 8,000 third-party apps and services rely on Plaid, the company claims. 
To be clear, you don’t need a dedicated Plaid app to use it; the technology is baked into a wide array of apps, including the budget trackers I tested for this guide. Once you find the “add an account” option in whichever one you’re using, you’ll see a menu of commonly used banks. There’s also a search field you can use to look yours up directly. Once you find yours, you’ll be prompted to enter your login credentials. If you have two-factor authentication set up, you’ll need to enter a one-time passcode as well. 
As the middleman, Plaid is a passthrough for information that may include your account balances, transaction history, account type and routing or account number. Plaid uses encryption, and says it has a policy of not selling or renting customer data to other companies. However, I would not be doing my job if I didn’t note that in 2022 Plaid was forced to pay $58 million to consumers in a class action suit for collecting “more financial data than was needed.” As part of the settlement, Plaid was compelled to change some of its business practices. 
In a statement provided to Engadget, a Plaid spokesperson said the company continues to deny the allegations underpinning the lawsuit and that “the crux of the non-financial terms in the settlement are focused on us accelerating workstreams already underway related to giving people more transparency into Plaid’s role in connecting their accounts, and ensuring that our workstreams around data minimization remain on track.” 
How to import your financial data from the Mint app 
Mint users should consider getting their data ready to migrate to their new budgeting app of choice soon. Unfortunately, importing data from Mint is not as easy as entering your credentials from inside your new app and hitting “import.” In fact, any app that advertises the ability to port over your stats from Mint is just going to have you upload a CSV file of transactions and other data. 
To download a CSV file from Mint, do the following: 
 
 Sign into Mint.com and hit Transactions in the menu on the left side of the screen. 
 Select an account, or all accounts. 
 Scroll down and look for “export [number] transactions” in smaller print. 
 Your CSV file should begin downloading. 
 
Note: Downloading on a per-account basis might seem more annoying, but could help you get set up on the other side, if the app you’re using has you importing transactions one-for-one into their corresponding accounts. 
How we tested Mint alternatives 
Before I dove into the world of budgeting apps, I had to do some research. To find a list of apps to test, I consulted trusty ol’ Google (and even trustier Reddit); read reviews of popular apps on the App Store; and also asked friends and colleagues what budget tracking apps they might be using. Some of the apps I found were free, just like Mint. These, of course, show loads of ads (excuse me, “offers”) to stay in business. But most of the available apps require paid subscriptions, with prices typically topping out around $100 a year, or $15 a month. (Spoiler: My top pick is cheaper than that.) 
Since this guide is meant to help Mint users find a permanent replacement, any services I chose to test needed to do several things: import all of your account data into one place; offer budgeting tools; and track your spending, net worth and credit score. Except where noted, all of these apps are available for iOS, Android and on the web. 
Once I had my shortlist of six apps, I got to work setting them up. For the sake of thoroughly testing these apps (and remember, I really was looking for a Mint alternative myself), I made a point of adding every account to every budgeting app, no matter how small or immaterial the balance. What ensued was a veritable Groundhog Day of two-factor authentication. Just hours of entering passwords and one-time passcodes, for the same banks half a dozen times over. Hopefully, you only have to do this once. 
What about Rocket Money? 
Rocket Money is another free financial app that tracks spending and supports things like balance alerts and account linking. If you pay for the premium tier, the service can also help you cancel unwanted subscriptions. We did not test it for this guide, but we&#39;ll consider it in future updates.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/the-best-budgeting-apps-to-replace-mint-143047346.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2024-12%2Fd031afd0-b801-11ef-adbb-126c481ecbeb&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=93df22068c3e8cd8bb08a8d166104722ba1d9c0f,https://www.engadget.com/apps/the-best-budgeting-apps-to-replace-mint-143047346.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-08T10:01:27Z,13,Tech

Offensive security takes center stage in the AI era,"
		
					  
						




Sara Madden is looking to take a more offensive approach to safeguarding her company.



The Convera CISO wants to add a red team to stress test the financial services company’s systems and identify where defenses should be bolstered. She also wants to incorporate purple teaming, where red and blue teams collaborate to improve overall security.



“I think offensive security is a place we need to get to, because [we] can use the information obtained from it to fine-tune the security program and controls,” Madden says.



Madden is not alone in her desire to add an offensive program to advance her cybersecurity strategy.



Enterprise security’s remit is defensive in nature: to protect and defend the company’s systems, data, reputation, customers, and employees. But CISOs like Madden have been increasingly adding offensive components to their strategies, seeing attack simulations as a way to gain valuable information about their technology environments, defense postures, and the weaknesses hackers would find if they attack.



Now a growing percentage of CISOs see offensive security as a must-have and, as such, are building up offensive capabilities and integrating them into their security processes to ensure the information revealed during offensive exercises leads to improvements in their overall security posture.



“It’s super important to have time and resources dedicated to [using] threat intelligence and conducting tabletop exercises and getting to the point where you have purple teaming,” Madden says, “because you don’t want to always be on your heels.”



Components of offensive security



Offensive security, or OffSec for short, is the practice of using attacker-style tactics to find and fix vulnerabilities in an organization’s own IT environment.



Dan Mellen, global and US cyber CTO at professional services firm EY, defines it as the organization’s “identification and exploitation of vulnerabilities before adversaries do.”



Mellen sees several buckets of activities involved in offensive security, starting with vulnerability management at the bottom end of the maturity scale, and then moving up to attack service management and penetration testing, to threat hunting and adversarial simulations, such as tabletop exercises.



“Then there’s the concept of purple teaming where the organization looks at an attack scenario and what were the defenses that should have alerted but didn’t and how to rectify those,” he says.



Other offensive security components include:




Red teaming, where ethical hackers simulate real-world attacks to test detection and response capabilities. Red teams aim to emulate threat actors by using stealthy tactics to bypass controls and achieve objectives such as data exfiltration or privilege escalation.



Adversary emulation, where security pros re-create known threat actor tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) based on threat intelligence to validate defensive tools and train incident response teams under real-world conditions.



Social engineering assessments, which test humans and processes through phishing, pretexting, and other manipulation techniques to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses. It’s similar to the way pen testing tests technology systems.



Security tool evasion testing, which tests how well an organization’s security technologies detect and block evasive techniques such as obfuscation, encryption, or living-off-the-land tactics, and tests whether those security technologies can be bypassed via malicious techniques.




Some of these offensive security components — namely vulnerability management, pen testing, and phishing — have been longstanding elements of most enterprise security programs. For example, 88% of security leaders consider pen testing to be a “vital component of their organization’s overall security efforts,” according to the 2025 CISO Perspectives Report from cybersecurity software maker Cobalt.



Many CISOs also have had team members with specific offensive security skills for many years. In fact, the Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP), the Offensive Security Experienced Penetration Tester (OSEP), and the Offensive Security Certified Expert (OSCE) certifications from OffSec are all credentials that have been in demand for years. Of late, the field of OffSec, pen testing, and ethical hacking certifications has grown considerably.



Offensive security technologies are not new, either.



However, experts say advancements in vendor products thanks to the addition of automation, analytics, and artificial intelligence have increased the effectiveness of offensive security programs while also lowering the barrier of entry for security teams to add OffSec to their operations.



“We’re seeing a lot of tech providers bring capabilities to market to support this proactive, or offensive, approach,” Mellen says.



Challenges to OffSec operations



Still, many security departments have yet to adopt a comprehensive offensive security program — with small and midsize companies being the most likely to have little to no OffSec elements, Mellen says, adding that limited resources — budget, staff, skills — create a common barrier to implementing or maturing offensive security.



Another factor that keeps CISOs from incorporating more offensive security into their strategies is concern about exposing vulnerabilities they don’t have the ability to address, Mellen adds. “They can’t unknow that they have those vulnerabilities if they’re not able to do something about them, although the hackers are going to find them whether or not you identify them,” he says.



Still, Mellen and others contend that it’s critical for CISOs to implement and expand OffSec measures now as hackers increasingly leverage AI to launch more targeted and more sophisticated attacks at a faster clip. To counteract hackers’ growing capabilities, experts say CISOs must become faster in identifying and closing security gaps — which is exactly what OffSec enables CISOs to do.



“Offensive security is more important than it was before, because threat actors are using AI-enabled tools to develop attacks we haven’t experienced before. Back when hackers were using script kiddies, attacks were fairly predictable,” says Aimee Cardwell, CISO in residence at tech company Transcend and former CISO of UnitedHealth Group. “Now hacks are so esoteric, they’re almost hard to understand. And if you’re only relying on scanning, you’re not catching potential vulnerabilities early enough or at all. You need to continuously be looking for them through offensive security.”



The business case for OffSec



Mellen says CISOs can use the information gleaned from their offensive security programs to create business cases for additional investments in the security program. “That data-driven evidence can go a long way to quantifying risk and quantifying the effort and cost to remediation,” he explains.



Bill Dunnion, CISO of telecommunications company Mitel, sees a strong case for adopting more offensive security measures in his own organization.



“To me, offensive security is to think like the bad guys. I have to think, ‘What would I do? How would I get in? Can I find those back doors and windows that have been left open?’ so I can find them and fix them,” he says. “What you don’t know in the world of security can kill you, so what offensive security does for me is that it helps me identify the unknowns. And once I know something is there, I can mitigate it.”



Dunnion already has some OffSec components in his cyber strategy, including vulnerability management, pen testing, and threat hunting, but wants to expand such capabilities. For example, he wants to create a formal threat hunting program rather than doing threat hunting on an ad hoc basis — as his team does now.



Utkarsh Choudhary, senior manager of IT security at Deloitte Canada, is another proponent of adopting more OffSec elements, seeing it as “sending out scouts and testing out walls and fences to see if those controls really work.”



“It is more systematic and a continuous approach of validating,” he adds, noting that offensive security has become an essential element because of the increasing complexity of today’s enterprise IT environment and the typical organization’s ever-expanding attack surface.



Choudhary also points out that many OffSec components, such as pen testing, are required by business partners and clients, and by certain regulations and frameworks such as ISO 270001.



Like others, Choudhary says OffSec practices help organizations better understand their risks. “It provides you an empirical assessment and forces honesty in the organization,” he says. “It validates what you’re doing well and what you’re not doing well. It proves to the organization if something isn’t sufficient. It gives you a true proof of risk.”



To maximize the value, however, Choudhary and others say organizations must move beyond having OffSec components to integrating their offensive program with their defensive one.



“Offense doesn’t displace defense; it strengthens what defense has been missing. Offense enhances the defense posture,” Choudhary says. “Offensive security adds a security layer to defense, so it’s not either, or even both, but that they have to work in concert. And that makes the organization more proactive rather than reactive, because it lessens the opportunities for hackers to get in.”

Vaillant CISO: NIS2 complexity and lack of clarity endanger its mission,"
		
					  
						












CSO Germany: The energy sector is increasingly becoming a target for cybercriminals. Experts and the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) believe that protection in this area must be significantly increased. How do you assess the current situation?



Reiß: The geopolitical tensions we are currently witnessing are leading to an increased threat level. This naturally also affects the heating industry, in which Vaillant operates and which fulfills everyone’s basic need for warmth and hot water at home. Such sectors absolutely must be better protected. The problem is that the attacks are becoming increasingly targeted and complex. These days, we’re no longer dealing with less experienced script kiddies working in their basements, but rather with well-organized and professional cybercriminals. Their goal is to harm the company or the economy of the respective country.



Furthermore, the use of artificial intelligence within companies has lowered the barrier to entry for attacks on businesses and supply chains than ever before. This makes it easier, for example, to create targeted phishing emails or develop malware, which previously required significantly more effort.



How are you reacting to the changed situation? How are you currently protecting your company from cyberattacks?



Reiß: We pursue a holistic approach to information security. This means we examine every aspect from top to bottom and rely on a multilayered security concept. This includes both preventative and reactive security measures to enable us to react quickly and effectively in an emergency. We are aware, however, that no company can guarantee absolute security. Therefore, everyone should plan with the assumption that a successful attack is always possible.



We prioritize the security of not only our internal IT infrastructure, but also our global production and products for our customers. Protecting our end customers and adhering to high security standards are our top priorities — especially given the growing threat of ransomware attacks. Our focus is on proactively minimizing risks and ensuring long-term trust in our solutions.



And the employees?



Reiß: Cybersecurity begins with people. Thanks to Vaillant’s global network, we clearly focus on this when it comes to security. Through our holistic four-pillar approach, we rely on comprehensive awareness training for our entire workforce, from gamification approaches to practical compliance training. We also address topics from the private sphere, such as phishing examples from some telecommunications companies or parcel delivery services, to increase relevance and promote sustainable learning processes



What challenges are currently causing the most problems for CISOs?



Reiß: First of all, the role of the CISO has fundamentally changed in recent years. Previously, the focus was primarily on technical aspects and operational security. Today, strategic alignment and leadership skills are key qualifications. A modern CISO must not only manage technological risks but also act as a sparring partner for management, assess business risks, and embed information security as an integral part of the corporate strategy.



From my perspective, the biggest challenges currently lie in implementing new legal requirements such as NIS2, DORA, and the Cyber ​​Resilience Act. I describe the whole thing as a regulatory jungle that first needs to be understood. We are operating in a complex regulatory environment that must be interpreted pragmatically and implemented with the right resources. Ultimately, it’s not just about ensuring compliance, but about increasing the security level throughout the entire company to create greater resilience.



Do we have too many safety rules?



Reiß: In the heating industry, the regulatory requirements are manageable, even though NIS2 and others are relevant. I generally welcome uniform standards, as they increase safety in Germany and Europe. The challenge lies in national implementation: Each country interprets the regulations differently, which creates considerable complexity for internationally operating companies.



The legislators behind NIS2 have failed to develop uniform and pragmatic security rules for implementation across Europe. While NIS2 was adopted at the EU level, it must be transposed into the local legislation of each country. This means that each country contributes its own interpretation. Organizations operating across Europe must therefore consider all relevant legislation in their respective regions. Ensuring a standardized procedure in this context adds further complexity and requires significant coordination.



Why are so many companies still struggling with implementation?



Reiß: Often, the interpretation of the regulations lacks clarity. Many companies — especially SMEs — don’t know if they even fall within their scope. Added to this are questions about resource allocation: Should implementation be done internally or with external partners? Who assumes responsibility — IT, the compliance department, or a dedicated security team? Furthermore, there is often a lack of maturity and awareness regarding where and how cybersecurity needs to be strategically embedded so that such topics can be implemented appropriately. These factors hamper progress and cost companies crucial time.



There’s no one-size-fits-all approach to regulations. I recommend that companies analyze their current situation, define initial steps, and get started. My motto is: Start, don’t wait!

Apple's AirPods Pro 3 drop to $230 on Amazon,"If you haven&#39;t yet upgraded to Apple&#39;s AirPods Pro 3, you can pick up the company&#39;s latest model at a discount through a deal on Amazon right now. The AirPods Pro 3, which came out in September, are currently $20 off, bringing their price down to $230. With the new AirPods Pro, Apple made some big improvements, including better battery life and sound quality, and introduced useful new features, such as Live Translation. 

  
The AirPods Pro 3 are the best AirPods available today, with Apple&#39;s H2 chip, and earned a score of 90 out of 100 in Engadget&#39;s review this fall. Active noise cancellation (ANC) is one of the biggest selling points of the AirPods Pro, and Apple has made the experience even better with the AirPods Pro 3. They sport new foam-infused ear tips that create a better seal to improve passive noise isolation, and as Engadget&#39;s Billy Steele wrote in his review, &#34;Ultra-low-noise microphones combine with advanced computational audio to silence even more background noise.&#34; In testing, they had no problem blocking out the chatter of people nearby or otherwise noisy environments. 
With the AirPods Pro 3, Apple introduced heart-rate sensing, so you&#39;ll be able to see your heart rate data from the earbuds in the Fitness app and other workout apps.

OpenAI’s head of ChatGPT says posts appearing to show in-app ads are ‘not real or not ads’,"Those might not exactly be ads you&#39;re seeing on ChatGPT, at least according to OpenAI. Nick Turley, OpenAI&#39;s head of ChatGPT, clarified the confusion around potential ads appearing with the AI chatbot. In a post on X, Turley said &#34;there are no live tests for ads&#34; and that &#34;any screenshots you&#39;ve seen are either not real or not ads.&#34; The OpenAI exec&#39;s explanation comes after another post from former xAI employee Benjamin De Kraker on X that has gained traction, which featured a screenshot showing an option to shop at Target within a ChatGPT conversation.
OpenAI&#39;s Daniel McAuley responded to the post, arguing that it&#39;s not an ad but rather an example of app integration that the company announced in October. However, the company&#39;s chief research officer, Mark Chen, also replied on X that they &#34;fell short&#34; in this case, adding that &#34;anything that feels like an ad needs to be handled with care.&#34;
&#34;We’ve turned off this kind of suggestion while we improve the model’s precision,&#34; Chen wrote on X. &#34;We’re also looking at better controls so you can dial this down or off if you don’t find it helpful.&#34;
There&#39;s still a lot of uncertainty about whether OpenAI will introduce ads to ChatGPT, but in November, someone discovered code in a beta version of the ChatGPT app on Android that made several mentions of ads. Even in Turley&#39;s post debunking the inclusion of live ads, the OpenAI exec added that &#34;if we do pursue ads, we’ll take a thoughtful approach.&#34; Turley also posted that &#34;people trust ChatGPT and anything we do will be designed to respect that.&#34;This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/openais-head-of-chatgpt-says-posts-appearing-to-show-in-app-ads-are-not-real-or-not-ads-190454584.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F0b64d560-d399-11f0-bc3f-d6a5bc8f762a&resize=1400%2C952&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=937459db2c0b5b4affa66457589811925c648783,https://www.engadget.com/ai/openais-head-of-chatgpt-says-posts-appearing-to-show-in-app-ads-are-not-real-or-not-ads-190454584.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-07T19:04:54Z,7,Tech
X shuts down the European Commission’s ad account the day after major fine,"Just a day after receiving a roughly $140 million fine, X has terminated the ad account of the European Commission. Nikita Bier, X&#39;s head of product, accused the European Commission of using an exploit to artificially boost the reach of its post announcing the major fine.
In the post, Bier said that the commission &#34;logged into [their] dormant ad account to take advantage of an exploit in our Ad Composer&#34; and posted &#34;a link that deceives users into thinking it’s a video and to artificially increase its reach.&#34; Bier explained in a separate post that the exploit has &#34;never been abused like this&#34; and &#34;is now patched.&#34; However, X still revoked the European Commission&#39;s ability to buy and track ads on its platform.
While X decided to remove the European Commission&#39;s ad account, it still needs to submit specific measures and an action plan to address the concerns associated with the $140 million fine. The European Commission&#39;s spokesperson for Tech Sovereignty, Defence, Space and Research, Thomas Regnier, said that this is the first-ever fine under the Digital Services Act. The European legislative body claimed that X has a deceptive system when it comes to verified accounts, lacks transparency with its advertising repository and doesn&#39;t provide effective data for researchers. In response, X&#39;s owner, Elon Musk, replied to the European Commission&#39;s post, calling it &#34;bullshit.&#34;This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/x-shuts-down-the-european-commissions-ad-account-the-day-after-major-fine-173553267.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2Ff6d9dac0-d38c-11f0-9fcf-65770212f3e3&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=11b2c4c596f0877275572d1cd1a59c2f8d0e9d1d,https://www.engadget.com/social-media/x-shuts-down-the-european-commissions-ad-account-the-day-after-major-fine-173553267.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-07T17:35:53Z,7,Tech

Missing NBC on Fubo? Here's how to watch Sunday Night Football this week and more,"If you&#39;re a Fubo subscriber, you&#39;ve certainly noticed that NBC and all NBCUniversal-owned channels have gone dark on the platform. For over a week, customers have gone without NBC programming like the Today Show and The Voice, and for the second week in a row, customers will have to find alternate methods of watching this week&#39;s Sunday Night Football game, too. It&#39;s all because Fubo and NBCUniversal are having a contract dispute, so channels like NBC, USA Network, Telemundo, and Bravo have been unavailable on Fubo since Nov. 21, and as of now, there&#39;s no projected date for their return.  
A message released by Fubo to their customers explains, &#34;Fubo believes customers should have the option to choose among multiple distributors to access the content they love. Unfortunately, NBCU has offered terms regarding pricing and packaging that are egregiously above those offered to other distributors.&#34; A statement from an NBCU spokesperson adds, &#34;Fubo has chosen to drop NBCUniversal programming despite being offered the same terms agreed to by hundreds of other distributors. Unfortunately, this is par for the course for Fubo — they’ve dropped numerous networks in recent years at the expense of their customers, who continue to lose content.” (Fubo, for instance, cut Warner-owned channels back in 2024.) You can read more about exactly why Fubo is countering NBC&#39;s proposed deal here.  
While the companies are continuing discussions to come to an agreement, there is still no resolution. Fubo has already begun issuing $15 credits to subscribers&#39; bills as a gesture of goodwill, but if you&#39;re a Fubo customer and are wondering how to watch this week&#39;s biggest games and shows, here&#39;s everything you need to know about the Fubo-NBC blackout, which channels are missing and your options for where to watch them. 
How to watch Sunday Night Football without Fubo 
This week&#39;s Sunday Night Football matchup between the Houston Texans and the Kansas City Chiefs airs at 8:20 p.m. ET on NBC, but you&#39;ll also be able to stream it on Peacock, DirecTV, and Hulu + Live TV.  
What else is on NBC this week? 
In addition to this week&#39;s Sunday Night Football game, there are loads of sports on NBC, USA, Universo and more that you won&#39;t want to miss, including extensive Premiere League coverage, NBA and NHL games, plus dozens of new show premieres this week like Stumble and The Voice. On Bravo, there are new episodes of The Real Housewives of Potomac and The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City, and The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, too.

Why are these NBC-owned channels currently unavailable? 
Per Fubo, NBC channels were pulled from the platform because of a disagreement over their long-standing content distribution agreement that has yet to be resolved. 
When will the missing channels return? 
There is no information available as to when NBC&#39;s lineup of channels will return. Negotiations between the companies are ongoing. 
Is Fubo offering a rebate while these channels are missing? 
In a message to subscribers, Fubo stated, &#34;If NBCU programming remains off of Fubo for an extended period, we will directly credit $15 to your Fubo account.&#34; At least one Fubo customer on our staff received an email confirming the credit would be automatically applied in the December billing cycle. 
What alternatives do viewers have in the meantime? 
Looking to switch from Fubo? You&#39;ve got plenty of options, including Peacock, DirecTV, and Hulu + Live TV. Here are some of your choices:

Judge Amit Mehta&#39;s ruling on Friday means Google will have to renegotiate these contacts every year, which would create a fairer playing field for its competitors. The new details come after Mehta ruled in September that Google would not have to sell off Chrome, as the DOJ proposed at the end of 2024. This all follows the ruling last fall that Google illegally maintained an internet search monopoly through actions including paying companies such as Apple to make its search engine the default on their devices and making exclusive deals around the distribution of services such as Search, Chrome and Gemini. Mehta&#39;s September ruling put an end to these exclusive agreements and stipulates that Google will have to share some of its search data with rivals to &#34;narrow the scale gap&#34; its actions have created. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/judge-puts-a-one-year-limit-on-googles-contracts-for-default-search-placement-215549614.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2F2025-12%2Fb6c543ea-11ec-445a-bf45-e7ae3c4a3fb1&resize=1400%2C932&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=0298fd4872bc573aa0cc5a4c3b541b026e73f591,https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/judge-puts-a-one-year-limit-on-googles-contracts-for-default-search-placement-215549614.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-06T21:55:49Z,7,Tech
Meta reportedly delays mixed reality glasses until 2027,"aMeta lready sells VR headsets and Ray-Ban smart glasses, but these new glasses sound a bit different.

"Apple's Johny Srouji could continue the company's executive exodus, according to report","Apple&#39;s Johny Srouji may be the latest company executive to seek greener pastures, according to a report from Bloomberg. The report said that Srouji, Apple&#39;s senior vice president of hardware technologies, told Tim Cook that he is &#34;seriously considering leaving in the near future.&#34;
While the report didn&#39;t mention if Srouji has another job lined up, Bloomberg&#39;s sources claimed that he wants to join another company if he leaves Apple. Srouji joined the company in 2008 to develop Apple&#39;s first in-house system-on-a-chip and eventually led the transition to Apple silicon.
If Srouji leaves Apple, he would be the latest in a string of departures of longtime execs. At the start of the month, Apple announced that John Giannandrea, the company&#39;s senior vice president for machine learning and AI strategy, would be retiring from his role in spring 2026. A couple of days later, Bloomberg reported that the company&#39;s head of interface design, Alan Dye, would be leaving for a role at Meta. Adding to those exits, Apple also revealed that Kate Adams, who has been Apple&#39;s general counsel since 2017, and Lisa Jackson, vice president for Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives, will both be leaving in early 2026.
The shakeup at the executive level comes after Bloomberg&#39;s Mark Gurman previously reported that Cook may not be preparing for his own departure as CEO next year. Gurman&#39;s prediction counters a report from the Financial Times that claimed that Apple was accelerating succession plans for Cook with an expected stepping down sometime next year.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apples-johny-srouji-could-continue-the-companys-executive-exodus-according-to-report-200750252.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F455d2b50-d2db-11f0-8fff-90d6ed6860b6&resize=1400%2C1031&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=e79c5e9b73137c550f56e6beab4f9e47c55de954,https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apples-johny-srouji-could-continue-the-companys-executive-exodus-according-to-report-200750252.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-06T20:07:50Z,11,Tech

"Waymo's robotaxi fleet is being recalled again, this time for failing to stop for school buses","To prevent its robotaxi fleet from passing stopped school buses, Waymo is issuing another software recall in 2025. While it&#39;s not a traditional recall that pulls vehicles from the road, Waymo is voluntarily updating software for its autonomous fleet in response to an investigation from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. According to Waymo, the recall will be filed with the federal agency early next week.
Mauricio Peña, Waymo&#39;s chief safety officer, said in a statement that Waymo sees far fewer crashes involving pedestrians than human drivers, but that the company knows when &#34;our behavior should be better.&#34;
&#34;As a result, we have made the decision to file a voluntary software recall with NHTSA related to appropriately slowing and stopping in these scenarios,&#34; Peña said in a statement to multiple news outlets. &#34;We will continue analyzing our vehicles’ performance and making necessary fixes as part of our commitment to continuous improvement.&#34;
According to the NHTSA investigation, some Waymo autonomous vehicles were seen failing to stop for school buses that had their stop signs and flashing lights deployed. The federal agency said in the report that there were instances of Waymo cars driving past stopped school buses in Atlanta and Austin, Texas.
Earlier this year, Waymo issued another software recall after some of its robotaxi fleet were seen hitting gates, chains, and similar objects. Last year, Waymo also filed two other software recalls, one of which addressed a fleet vehicle crashing into a telephone pole and another correcting how two separate robotaxis hit the same exact pickup truck that was being towed.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/waymos-robotaxi-fleet-is-being-recalled-again-this-time-for-failing-to-stop-for-school-buses-190222243.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F4a05b050-d2d1-11f0-bfae-c7ee77d4ebd0&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=b627d2494721662776bb072fa3d0b3fd570f0279,https://www.engadget.com/transportation/waymos-robotaxi-fleet-is-being-recalled-again-this-time-for-failing-to-stop-for-school-buses-190222243.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-06T19:02:22Z,8,Tech

Meta plans to push back the debut of its next mixed reality glasses to 2027,"The big reveal for Meta&#39;s next mixed reality glasses is being postponed until the first half of 2027, according to a report from Business Insider. Based on an internal memo from Maher Saba, the vice president of Meta&#39;s Reality Labs Foundation, the report said that the company&#39;s project, which is codenamed &#34;Phoenix,&#34; will no longer be scheduled for a 2026 debut.
In a separate memo, Meta execs explained that the delay would help deliver a more &#34;polished and reliable experience.&#34; According to BI, a memo from Meta&#39;s Gabriel Aul and Ryan Cairns said this new release window is &#34;going to give us a lot more breathing room to get this right.&#34; Meta hasn&#39;t publicly revealed many details about its Phoenix project, but The Information previously reported that it would feature a goggle-like form factor with an external power source, similar to how the Apple Vision Pro is attached to a battery pack.
In the memo from Saba, BI reported that Meta is also working on a &#34;limited edition&#34; wearable with the codename &#34;Malibu 2.&#34; Yesterday, Meta announced its acquisition of Limitless, a startup that recently developed an AI wearable called Pendant. Even though Meta&#39;s current product portfolio is dominated by smart glasses and VR headsets, the Limitless acquisition and Malibu 2 project could hint at the company&#39;s plans to expand its offerings.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/meta-plans-to-push-back-the-debut-of-its-next-mixed-reality-glasses-to-2027-172437374.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2Fb8ca9d20-d2c2-11f0-b4bd-7bb93f4aadf5&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=7a59b26ee99f4c709947b56c599d2c426a387798,https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/meta-plans-to-push-back-the-debut-of-its-next-mixed-reality-glasses-to-2027-172437374.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-06T17:24:37Z,13,Tech

"Engadget review recap: Dell 16 Premium, Nikon ZR, Ooni Volt 2 and more","We’ve slept off our collective turkey coma and returned to the review lab here at Engadget. Our team may also be in full CES prep mode, but we’ve got a few more devices to get off or our desks before 2025 is over. Catch up on all of the reviews you might have missed over the last few weeks — a perfect activity for a lazy December weekend.
Dell 16 Premium

 
There’s no denying the design of the Dell 16 Premium makes the laptop live up to its name. Unfortunately, all of that polish leads to some issues: a high price and hampered usability. “The more I looked at the Dell 16 Premium&#39;s beautiful facade, the more I wanted something... more,” senior reporter Devindra Hardawar wrote. “It needs more usable ports, like HDMI and a full-sized SD card reader. It needs more useful function keys that are visible in bright light — and also stay in one place — so I can touch type more easily. And for the love of god, just give up on the invisible trackpad.”
DJI Osmo Action 6

 
DJI’s drone business in the US faces an uncertain future, and the company’s action cams could be swept up in the ordeal as well. Thankfully, our contributing reporter Steve Dent resides in the EU where he observed first hand the Osmo Action 6’s superior low light performance and battery life. “With a bigger sensor and larger aperture than the competition, DJI’s Action 6 is now the best action cam on the market for night shooting, delivering clean, sharp video with better stabilization than rivals,” he said. “It’s also ideal for users who output to both YouTube and TikTok.”
Nikon ZR

 
In keeping with the video theme, Steve also spent time testing the Nikon ZR. While this is primarily a model for shooting video, it benefits from the addition of RED RAW, excellent autofocus and more. “With the ZR, Nikon has shown that it’s finally catching up to and even surpassing its rivals for content creation,” he explained. “Whether you’re doing social media, YouTube, documentaries or even film production, this camera is versatile and powerful with few compromises.”
Ooni Volt 2

 
The Ooni Volt brought the company’s popular brand of pizza making indoors for the first time, but that model wasn’t without it faults. Now Ooni is back with the Volt 2, and the completely overhauled design is a big upgrade over the original. “It’s easier to use for all skill levels thanks to its clearer controls and large display,” I explained. “Presets work well, but they can also serve as a starting point for further recipe refinement for experienced users. And the pizza — my goodness, the pizza is consistently restaurant quality (or better) across a range of styles.” 
Antigravity A1

 
Insta360’s spin-off Antigravity is now shipping its first drone and our UK bureau chief Mat Smith has already flown it. The A1 comes with a controller and FPV headset to assist with the piloting, but the mix of unique features and crisp video (in good conditions) is also laudable. “The intuitive controls and ability to look all around you make it unlike anything else currently available,” he said. “It’s a delightful introduction to drones, FPV or otherwise, but a shame that software issues marred my tests.” 
Other recent reviews
On the gaming front, Mat spent some time with Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles while deputy editor Nathan Ingraham put Metroid Prime 4 through its paces. Contributor Tim Stevens stepped back in time with the Analogue 3D to revisit some Nintendo 64 classics after getting behind the wheel of the 2025 Porsche Macan Electric.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/engadget-review-recap-dell-16-premium-nikon-zr-ooni-volt-2-and-more-130000527.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2FDell_16_Premium-2.jpg&resize=1400%2C846&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=464dcd5b0e8124a515d0ce0db9ea255bb5f39bdc,https://www.engadget.com/engadget-review-recap-dell-16-premium-nikon-zr-ooni-volt-2-and-more-130000527.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-06T13:00:00Z,9,Tech

"A Marvel beat-'em-up, long-awaited survival horror and other new indie games worth checking out","Welcome to our latest roundup of what&#39;s going on in the indie game space. A bunch of titles that are arriving very late to make it into game of the year conversations debuted this week, and we learned some new details about upcoming projects, such as a release date for a rad-looking arena shooter called Don&#39;t Stop, Girlypop.Marvel Cosmic Invasion is one of the higher-profile indies to hit consoles and PC this week. It&#39;s from Tribute Games and publisher Dotemu, the same pair that brought us Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder&#39;s Revenge. Cosmic Invasion largely draws from the same playbook: it&#39;s also a retro-style side-scrolling beat-&#39;em-up with a look that apes the Marvel animated shows from the &#39;90s. It&#39;s an enjoyable enough game, largely thanks to the variety of characters and how differently they play. Captain America is one of my favorites.  Each character has a secondary move (often a ranged attack) to go with their basic melee strikes, and Cap&#39;s one has no ammo or cooldown. I never grew tired of spamming his shield projectile attack and knocking enemies off the screen. I really enjoyed playing as She-Hulk too. Her secondary move involves grabbing an enemy and throwing them around. She-Hulk can also toss them into the air then leap with McTominay-esque athleticism to deliver a kick and send the baddie crashing into its cohorts. The character swap system (each player chooses two and can switch between them any time) evokes tag fighting games and the co-op features work well too.There isn&#39;t a ton of depth to Marvel Cosmic Invasion, unfortunately, but the presentation is spot on. It&#39;s out now on Steam, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S for $30. It&#39;s also on Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass.New releasesIt only took 13 years from announcement to release but survival horror title Routine (from Lunar Software and publisher Raw Fury) has emerged on Steam, the Xbox PC app, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and Xbox Cloud. It&#39;s available on Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass.Routine offers up a slice of liminal space terror with a dash of retro-futurism. Lunar Software based the aesthetic on &#34;how people from the 1980s might envision a believable moon base&#34; with analogue technology.Your mission is to explore the base and try to determine how it got to this state. Lunar wanted Routine to feel as immersive as possible, so there are no waypoint markers and you won&#39;t see a heads-up display. Instead, you have a personal data assistant that connects to wireless access points throughout the base and provides you with information about your current goals. Here&#39;s another horror title we&#39;ve been looking forward to for several years. Sleep Awake deals with things that go bump in the night. It&#39;s a first-person psychedelic horror game in which a force called The HUSH makes anyone who falls asleep vanish. So, our hero Katja and other residents of the last-known city on Earth try various ways to stay awake, but they’ll inevitably have to deal with the effects of sleep derivation. Sleep Awake is from Eyes Out — a studio formed by Spec Ops: The Line director Cory Davis and Nine Inch Nails guitarist Robin Finck — and publisher Blumhouse Games. It&#39;s out now on Steam, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S for $30.How about another horror game? It&#39;s the last one we have this week, I promise. Tingus Goose has been on my radar for a while because it just looks so deeply strange. This is billed as &#34;a cozy body horror idle game&#34; in which you &#34;plant seeds in patients, bounce babies for profit and ascend through surreal worlds toward riches.&#34; I&#39;m glad for that description from the game&#39;s PR team, because I don&#39;t fully know what to make of the trailer. A goose emerges from a human being&#39;s torso and grows a giant neck and human fingers stick out of it and… it&#39;s all just so strange. But I kinda dig it? Tingus Goose is from SweatyChair and co-publishers Playsaurus and UltraPlayers. It&#39;s on Steam for $5.94 until December 8, and it will cost $7 after that.I haven&#39;t seen anything that looks quite like Effulgence RPG before. It&#39;s a party-based RPG with a 3D ASCII art style. Here, you&#39;ll need to take out enemies to acquire better gear.Andrei Fomin released Effulgence RPG in early access on Steam this week for $10. The solo developer is aiming to release the full version of the game in June and to add more content and quality-of-life updates in the meantime. It&#39;s not usually the kind of game that I&#39;d normally be drawn toward, but that art style alone is cool enough to make me want to try it.Looking for something a little more relaxing? Log Away is a cozy cabin builder from The-Mark Entertainment. There are several environments to choose from and a variety of decorations at your disposal depending on your interests. You can have a pet too, so that qualifies Log Away as this week&#39;s dog game.I&#39;ve played it a bit and found it to be quite relaxing, a soothing counter punch to the non-stop action of Cosmic Invasion. It&#39;s out now on Steam for $10, but if you buy it by December 11 you&#39;ll save a dollar and get a Christmas-themed DLC at no extra cost.I adore Sayonara Wild Hearts with every fiber of my being and I appreciated what Simogo did with Lorelai and the Laser Eyes, even if I never stuck with it for long. I haven&#39;t played any of the studio&#39;s earlier games, though. That&#39;s something I&#39;m planning to fix very soon now that the Simogo Legacy Collection is here.The studio reworked all of its first seven mobile games — including Year Walk and Device 6 — and combined them into a collection that&#39;s available on Steam, Nintendo Switch and Switch 2. It costs $15 though there&#39;s a 15 percent discount until December 12. I&#39;m very much looking forward to digging into this over the holidays.Upcoming I&#39;ve been very much looking forward to Don’t Stop, Girlypop! for a while. It&#39;s a movement-focused arena shooter with a Y2K aesthetic. Think of it as an anti-capitalist, hyperpop riff on games like Doom Eternal.The demo is a lot of fun and I&#39;m glad there&#39;s finally a release date for this game from  Funny Fintan Softworks and publisher Kwalee. It&#39;s coming to Steam on January 29.Limbot seems like it could be a fun party game. You can play it by yourself, but having three friends join you seems like the optimal way to go. In that case, each of you will take control of one of a cardboard robot&#39;s limbs. So you&#39;ll have to coordinate to move around this papercraft world effectively and complete precision-based objectives. It sounds like a recipe for an Overcooked-style tiff between friends.This physics-based game from Ionized Studios is coming to Steam, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S. It&#39;s slated to arrive between April and June next year.Polyperfect&#39;s Zlin City: Arch Moderna is a diorama city builder inspired by historical events of the 1930s and &#39;40s and the architecture of Zlin, a town in Czechia (Czech Republic). The developers used 3D printing, photogrammetry and 3D scanning to capture the objects that are used in the game. The result is something that — at least at first glance — looks beautifully textured. There&#39;s no confirmed release window for Zlin City: Arch Moderna as yet.

Warning: React2Shell vulnerability already being exploited by threat actors,"
		
					  
						




Plugging the React2Shell vulnerability in the open source React server and Next.js in IT environments has just become even more urgent with reports that exploits are already in the wild.



Researchers at Greynoise said today they are seeing “opportunistic, largely automated exploitation attempts” trying to take advantage of the unsafe deserialization vulnerability in React Server Components (RSC).



There’s an early focus on attacking just this vulnerability, the report adds, “but we’ve already detected a slow migration of this CVE being added to Mirai and other botnet exploitation kits.”



The initial access attempts are using publicly disclosed proof of concept (PoC) code as a base, Greynoise says, with stage 1 payloads performing proof of execution (PoE) probes (for example, PowerShell arithmetic) to validate RCE cheaply, and using coded PowerShell download-and-execute stagers. Then a stage 2 payload that uses reflection to set System.Management.Automation.AmsiUtils.amsiInitFailed = true (a standard AMSI bypass), and iex executes the next stage.



JFrog’s security research team also today reported finding a working proof of concept that leads to code execution, and they and others have also reported finding fake PoCs containing malicious code on GitHub. “Security teams must verify sources before testing [these PoCs],” warns JFrog.



Amitai Cohen, attack vector intel lead at Wiz, also said today that the firm has seen both proof of concept exploits being published and active exploitation attempts in the wild. “Our threat teams have detected these attempts across customer environments, including deployments of cryptojacking malware and efforts to steal cloud credentials from compromised machines,” he said in an email.



The Greynoise report follows one by New Zealand researcher Lachlan Davidson, who discovered the holes and found that a real proof of concept began circulating about 30 hours after those maintaining React revealed the holes.



Separately, Amazon said its threat intelligence teams have seen active exploitation attempts by multiple China state-nexus threat groups, including Earth Lamia and Jackpot Panda.



AWS has deployed multiple layers of automated protection, including the AWS WAF (web application firewall). But the company stresses these protections aren’t substitutes for patching, even for IT departments running React or Next.js in an Amazon environment.

If exploited, the vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-55182 in React RCS and CVE-2025-66478 specifically for the Next.js framework, allows a threat actor to remotely run malicious code.



Maintained by Meta, React is an open source library for building application interfaces. There are several frameworks that build on top of it, with Next.js being highly popular among developers, so exploiting the vulnerability in RCS can spread to these frameworks.



The critical vulnerability in React Server Components has a maximum Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score of 10. Affected are React versions 19.x and Next.js versions 15.x and 16.x when using App Router.



The problem specifically is in RCS’s Flight protocol, used for communications with clients such as browsers. RCS, notes Greynoise, is a high value target since it sits in front of application logic that often runs with production permissions.



“Thanks to services such as BuiltWith/Wappalyzer, the exposed services are easy to find and exploit at scale,” Greynoise warned.



However, there are some nuances in these early reports of proofs of concept.



Davidson noted that the day-0 protections from some application security providers are actually runtime-level, and not just web application firewall rules. That means many customers with theoretically vulnerable versions are still protected, he wrote.



Amazon added that analysis of data from its honeypot shows the persistent nature of some exploitation attempts. In one notable example, an unattributed threat cluster associated with IP address 183[.]6.80.214 spent nearly an hour on Thursday systematically troubleshooting exploitation attempts.



This included 116 total requests directed at a target over 52 minutes, attempts at placing multiple exploit payloads, attempts at executing Linux commands, attempts to write files to /tmp/pwned.txt, and attempts to read /etcpasswd.



“This behavior demonstrates that threat actors aren’t just running automated scans,” Amazon said, “but are actively debugging and refining their exploitation techniques against live targets.



Edgar Kussberg, project lead for AI and development tools at Sonar, said to blunt attacks, developers or infosec teams should:




run an analysis: Deploy tests to find vulnerable code and misconfigurations before an attacker can;



get a clean signal: Focus on finding and fixing true positives and the most severe vulnerabilities;



verify code against updated rules: Ensure all defensive software is updated with the latest rules designed to detect and flag the specific React2Shell pattern, not just generic parameters.

The 1977 cut of Star Wars will return to theaters in 2027,"Here&#39;s some good news for the &#34;Han shot first&#34; crowd. The original cut of Star Wars (1977), the film known today as A New Hope, is coming back to theaters. We first learned in August that some version of the film would be screened again in 2027 for its 50th anniversary. But we know now this will indeed be the version everyone saw before George Lucas made those questionable, CGI-heavy changes in the 1997 Special Editions. The re-release arrives in theaters on February 19, 2027.In a short update posted Friday on the official Star Wars website, Lucasfilm all but clarified that this will be the original cut. It described it as &#34;a newly restored version of the classic Star Wars (1977) theatrical release.&#34; Gizmodo reported that it received further clarification that this will indeed be the OG one, before those &#34;improvements” in the Special Edition (and subsequent re-releases).Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) in a scene from Star Wars: A New Hope.Disney PlusThose mid-&#39;90s edits included early CGI effects that essentially served as a testing ground before Lucas moved on to the Prequel Trilogy. It also added a CG Jabba the Hutt / Han Solo scene (originally shot with actor Thomas Declan Mulholland as Jabba) that was cut from the original version.Perhaps most infamously, Lucas made Greedo shoot first at Han in the canteen scene. Hardcore fans hated the change. It smoothed some of the rough edges of Han&#39;s start. It gave him a shorter, less dramatic journey into the reluctant hero he grew into as the story progressed. It&#39;s as if Lucas was signaling, &#34;Okay, Han may have started as kind of a jerk, but he wouldn&#39;t shoot a bounty hunter in cold blood! Think of the children watching!&#34;But in my view, Return of the Jedi had the worst changes in 1997 and later. Although I didn&#39;t mind the new celebration music and location montage at the end (others disagree), it also added that cringey and out-of-place musical number in Jabba&#39;s palace. But I despised the change Lucas made for the film’s 2011 Blu-ray release: Darth Vader&#39;s overly telegraphed &#34;Nooooooo…&#34; as he makes the climactic decision to chuck the Emperor into the Death Star&#39;s reactor shaft. C’mon, George: It’s so more powerful for the audience to project Vader’s thought process onto his silent helmet. But if Disney sticks with the 50th Anniversary scheme, we&#39;ll have to wait until 2033 to see the untainted version of that movie in theaters again.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/the-1977-cut-of-star-wars-will-return-to-theaters-in-2027-221113091.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2Fhan.jpg&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=8cf3a02913f13d3dc8ae217b3ba79e7459060a0a,https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/the-1977-cut-of-star-wars-will-return-to-theaters-in-2027-221113091.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-05T22:11:13Z,8,Tech

"Insecure use of Signal app part of wider Department of Defense problem, suggests Senate report","
		
					  
						




The Signalgate scandal that enveloped US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth in March appears to be symptomatic of a wider lax attitude towards the use of non-approved messaging apps by officials and employees, a Senate Committee has concluded.



In March, the US Senate Committee on Armed Services set out to examine issues raised by the Signalgate incident: the need to clarify the existing rules on using “non-controlled” apps, and looking at whether Defense Secretary Hegseth adhered to them in his use of Signal, and whether his actions were evidence of a wider culture of insecure app usage within the Department of Defense (DoD).



This week’s dual reports have come back with a mixed assessment of these points. Broadly, what Hegseth was accused of doing – communicating sensitive information using a third-party messaging app – appears to have been happening at the DoD in less serious contexts since at least 2020.



This mirrors issues familiar to enterprises: unsanctioned or unmanaged messaging apps, including ones touting end-to-end encryption (E2EE) security, quickly become an IT backchannel that can invisibly undermine carefully-assembled security, compliance, and data retention policies.



Shadow communications



The first report, an assessment of the Defense Secretary’s use of the Signal app to communicate with senior colleagues in advance of a military operation against Yemen on March 15, is used to illustrate the point. It confirms the widely reported fact that two hours before the raid, Hegseth revealed details of the operation to a Signal group of 19 people, including a journalist who had been added to it in error.



In doing so, the report agrees he violated security policies by sending sensitive information from a personal device, and using the non-approved Signal app in a way that revealed important operational details in advance of the strike. The report ducks the issue of whether this information was classified at the time it was sent, noting that Hegseth was senior enough to determine this for himself.



The second background report has uncovered evidence of a more general culture of shadow communications in the DoD, including widespread use of video-conferencing apps during the Covid 19 pandemic.  



The evidence gathered is sparse and partly redacted, making it difficult to assess the seriousness of any breaches. Because the scope of its remit was limited to the evidence from previous audits, one of the committee’s recommendations is to undertake a more comprehensive assessment of unsanctioned app usage inside the DoD. There’s also a question mark around how old audits analyzed by a Senate committee could accurately measure something that, by its nature, is hidden and only recorded on personal devices.



Nevertheless, the report says it is certain that Hegseth’s actions were not an isolated example, noting that staff had “used non-DoD-controlled electronic messaging systems for a variety of reasons. For example, some personnel used them because of the systems’ perceived appearance of security. As a result, DoD personnel increased the risk of exposing sensitive DoD information to our adversaries and did not comply with the legal obligation to retain and preserve official records.”



In short, while there was no evidence that unsanctioned app use is routine or normalized, it is likely that enough staff are using them to make a serious breach possible at some point. The report concludes that one of the reasons staff have taken to these messaging apps was that they lack convenient alternatives. It recommends developing approved apps to remove this need, implementing a training program to ensure existing communication regulations are complied with, and limiting the authority to use messaging apps to senior staff, in specific circumstances.



What’s surprising about this is that it has taken a major political row at government level to raise an issue that enterprise CISOs have been grappling with for years: the effects of BYOD, shadow IT (and now shadow AI), and unsanctioned apps that creep into organizations without anyone realizing it.



Over the last two decades, the rise of mobile devices, the cloud, and apps has radically de-centralized IT in ways that top-down management models struggle to control. Meanwhile, nothing has changed; the Signal app at the center of this scandal remains hugely popular on both sides of the political divide, despite the appearance of additional issues with the technology.

Meta's latest acquisition suggests hardware plans beyond glasses and headsets,"Meta has acquired Limitless, the maker of an AI-powered &#34;Pendant,&#34; to work on building consumer hardware for the company, the startup announced via a YouTube video and blog post. So far, Meta has focused on selling VR headsets and AI smart glasses. Now the company seems interested in branching out.&#34;Meta recently announced a new vision to bring personal superintelligence to everyone and a key part of that vision is building incredible AI-enabled wearables. We share this vision and we&#39;ll be joining Meta to help bring our shared vision to life,&#34; Limitless CEO Dan Siroker said in the post announcing the acquisition.Limitless&#39; first product was Rewind, desktop productivity software that recorded everything you did on your computer and turned it into a searchable database you interacted with via a chatbot. The company later expanded into hardware with Pendant, essentially a clip-on Bluetooth microphone that applies the same concept (privacy concerns be damned) to the things you say or hear throughout the day.The company plans to support its existing Pendant customers &#34;for at least another year,&#34; but will no longer sell the wearable going forward. Current customers will be able to access all the features of Pendant without having to pay for a subscription, though Limitless says availability will vary per region. If you have data stored with Limitless and don’t want to hold onto your Pendant, you&#39;re now also able to export or delete your data if you choose.AI wearables focused on recording audio have emerged as a common form factor primarily because they lean on two things AI models do moderately well: transcribing audio into text and summarizing it. Meta dipping its toes into the space makes sense, if only because not everyone will want to wear glasses to receive the benefits of an AI assistant. Amazon acquired an AI wearable company called Bee in July 2025, presumably with similar intentions.Add in Meta&#39;s recent hiring of former Apple design lead Alan Dye, and you can start to imagine where things might be headed. In the future, the Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses and Meta Ray-Ban Display could be two entries in a larger lineup of AI-powered wearables.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/metas-latest-acquisition-suggests-hardware-plans-beyond-glasses-and-headsets-212930339.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2FLimitless-Pendant.jpg&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=db17316d19d7939d339368ada0cde933888a5df5,https://www.engadget.com/ai/metas-latest-acquisition-suggests-hardware-plans-beyond-glasses-and-headsets-212930339.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-05T21:29:30Z,15,Tech

Chinese cyberspies target VMware vSphere for long-term persistence,"
		
					  
						




Chinese state-sponsored threat actors are backdooring VMware vCenter and VMware ESXi servers with a malware program written in Go, allowing them to maintain long-term persistence in victim networks. According to a joint report by the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), National Security Agency (NSA), and Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (Cyber Centre) organizations from the government services and facilities and IT sectors have been the primary targets.



The malware program, known in the security industry as BRICKSTORM, was first reported by researchers from Mandiant and Google’s Threat Intelligence Group in September. At the time, Google said the backdoor remained undetected for 369 days on average and was found inside the networks of US legal services firms, SaaS providers, business process outsourcers, and technology companies.



For its part, CISA has thus far analyzed eight separate BRICKSTORM samples, including one collected from a VMware vCenter server of an organization where the infection went undetected for over a year and a half allowing attackers to move laterally through the network.



From web shell to domain control



In the incident investigated by CISA, the attackers originally compromised a public-facing web server, though it’s unclear through what method. This was followed up by the deployment of a web shell — essentially a web script that serves as a backdoor to enable the attackers to remotely execute commands on the server.



From the web server, the attackers were able to extract credentials for a service account and used it to access a domain controller from where they copied the Active Directory database. Credentials for a second service account were used to access another domain controller on the internal network and copy the AD database, which included credentials used by a managed service provider (MSP).



Using the MSP credentials, the attackers were able to access a VMware vCenter server and deployed the BRICKSTORM malware in the /etc/sysconfig/ directory.



Designed to work in virtualized environments



The CISA, NSA, and Canadian Cyber Center analysts note that some of the BRICKSTORM samples are virtualization-aware and they create a virtual socket (VSOCK) interface that enables inter-VM communication and data exfiltration.



The malware also checks the environment upon execution to ensure it’s running as a child process and from a specific path. This is part of a set of self-monitoring capabilities that ensure its persistence by reinstalling and executing itself if it detects something is not running correctly.



The malware mimics web server functionality for its command-and-control (C2) communication to blend in with legitimate traffic. It also provides a SOCKS5 proxy for attackers to tunnel traffic during lateral movement operations.



In terms of features, BRICKSTORM allows threat actors to browse the file system and execute shell commands, providing them with complete control over the compromised system.



“Once the secure connection to the C2 domain is established, Sample 1 uses a custom Go package wssoft2 to manage incoming network connections and to process commands it receives,” the CISA analysts said. “Commands are directed to one of three handlers based on the function it needs: SOCKS Handler, Web Service Handler, and Command Handler.”



Mitigations



The joint advisory includes indicators of compromise for the analyzed samples as well as YARA and Sigma detection rules. The agencies also make the following recommendations:




Upgrade VMware vSphere servers to the latest version.



Harden your VMware vSphere environments by applying VMware’s guidance.



Take inventory of all network edge devices and monitor for any suspicious network connectivity originating from these devices.



Ensure proper network segmentation restricts network traffic from the DMZ to the internal network.



Disable RDP and SMB from the DMZ to the internal network.



Apply the principle of least privilege and restrict service accounts to only needed permissions.



Increase monitoring for service accounts, which are highly privileged and have a predictable pattern of behavior (e.g., scans that reliably run at a certain hour of the day).



Block unauthorized DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) providers and external DoH network traffic to reduce unmonitored communications.

Pixel owners: You can now use your phone as a Switch 2 webcam,"The Switch 2&#39;s lack of a built-in camera means you need an external one for GameChat video calls. But now, if your phone is a Google Pixel, you don&#39;t even need one of those. Android Authority reported on Friday that the two now work nicely together (without needing third-party apps), and our tests confirm that.Google has technically supported the use of Android devices as external webcams for two years: The company added it in a quarterly update for Android 14. (Specifically, it added the ability for devices to use USB Video Class mode, or UVC.) But that functionality didn&#39;t work with the Switch 2 before the November Pixel Drop.How do we know it was that version? Well, before our Editor-in-Chief, Aaron Souppouris, installed November’s update on a Pixel, the Switch 2 webcam feature didn&#39;t work. After updating to that one today (but before installing the December update), it worked.If that wasn&#39;t enough, the November firmware&#39;s release notes listed a &#34;fix for an issue where webcam mode does not work properly with connected devices under certain conditions.&#34; That pretty much cinches it. Regardless, we reached out to Google for official confirmation, and we&#39;ll update this story if we hear back.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/pixel-owners-you-can-now-use-your-phone-as-a-switch-2-webcam-203407555.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2FGameChat_%25E2%2580%2593_Nintendo_Direct___Nintendo_Switch_2_3-32_screenshot.png&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=74dacbd496d2f2fbeca71571cb9b355941e2b4b9,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/pixel-owners-you-can-now-use-your-phone-as-a-switch-2-webcam-203407555.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-05T20:34:07Z,8,Tech
Liquid Swords' debut title is a $25 'noir action game' coming next year,"The debut game from Liquid Swords will arrive in early 2026, it was announced at today&#39;s PC Gaming Show. Samson: A Tyndalston Story is billed as &#34;a consequence-heavy noir action game&#34; by its developer, and focuses on the eponymous Samson McCray, a man who&#39;s got himself into serious debt in a city that doesn’t seem particularly forgiving. 
The debut trailer doesn’t give too much away in terms of story, but I’m getting gritty Max Payne-y vibes. Combat looks crunchy and visceral, and it sounds like Liquid Swords is going for an oppressive atmosphere. &#34;Samson is built on a simple, brutal truth: every day costs you,&#34; writes the studio in a press release. &#34;Debt grows with interest, and time works against you. Each job burns a limited pool of Action Points and every decision shifts how the city treats you—there are no do-overs. You move forward because standing still makes everything worse.&#34;

Liquid Swords has been teasing its first game for a while. The studio has some serious pedigree, being founded in 2020 by Christofer Sundberg, who created the Just Cause franchise when he was at Avalanche Studios. Developers who previously worked on Mad Max and the Battlefield series have also joined Sundberg at Liquid Swords, and the studio says it drew on its collective experience in combat systems, systemic design, animation and action-oriented storytelling to create Samson.
Just Cause was an open-world series, but it sounds like Samson will be a more focused experience, possibly reflected by its $25 price tag. At the beginning of the year, the studio laid off an undisclosed number of employees, something it said was necessary to ensure its “long-term sustainability” amid challenging industry conditions. Samson: A Tyndalston Story launches in early 2026 on Steam and the Epic Games Store. We don&#39;t yet know if it&#39;s coming to console as well.

Netflix to buy Warner Bros. for $82.7 billion,"Shortly after rumors of a deal between the two media giants broke, Netflix has announced it is buying Warner Bros., HBO and HBO Max for approximately $82.7 billion. If approved, the deal will take place after Warner Bros. has disentangled itself from both its legacy cable and Discovery assets as part of the already-announced de-merger. That&#39;s likely to take place in the third quarter of 2026, with this new tie-up taking place at some point after that.In a statement, Netflix said it expects to &#34;maintain&#34; Warner Bros. current operations, as well as its policy of theatrical releases for its films. But the deal may spell the end for HBO Max as its own product in the longer term, as the statement also says &#34;by adding the deep film and TV libraries and HBO and HBO Max programming, Netflix members will have even more high-quality titles from which to choose.&#34;Naturally, the deal will see Netflix become one of the biggest players in global media, combining its global reach with some of the most recognizable names in entertainment. That includes HBO, DC Studios, Cartoon Network, its game development studios and TCM, as well as the chunks of TNT not cast adrift with Discovery. It&#39;s likely the deal will not go ahead without a lot of objections from other buyers, as well as the government itself. Yesterday, Paramount Skydance said (via the Hollywood Reporter) any deal between WB and Netflix would be the result of an &#34;unfair&#34; process. Given the close ties between Paramount&#39;s new owners and the administration, it&#39;s likely any deal will be subject to scrutiny as well as the usual questions around the size of the combined operation.Since the announcement was made, Engadget senior reporter Devindra Hardawar has spoken with Hollywood players and collated studies and statements to answer any burning questions you might have on what this deal means for you. He also answers questions about the likelihood of regulatory approval, theatrical releases and physical media. Catch up on all that in his piece titled “The Netflix and Warner Bros. deal might be great for shareholders, but not for anyone else.”Update, December 5 2025, 1:45PM ET: This story has been updated to add a paragraph and link to a new article we’ve published that contains deeper analysis and more information about the Netflix/Warner Bros. deal and what that might mean for streaming, movies, TV and shareholders.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/netflix-to-buy-warner-bros-for-827-billion-120836295.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2Fff746820-d1da-11f0-b7ef-3d5c26d6c60d&resize=1400%2C783&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=0775ced90fda0cfd71c1f306d4f74ecab14f4af8,https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/netflix-to-buy-warner-bros-for-827-billion-120836295.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-05T18:45:06Z,8,Tech
"The Netflix and Warner Bros. deal might be great for shareholders, but not for anyone else","Netflix&#39;s $82.7 billion acquisition of Warner Bros. is, in many ways, the last thing a weakened Hollywood needs right now. The industry is still recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, where theaters were forced to close and audiences became even more comfortable with streaming films at home. The WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes in 2023, which were driven by legitimate concerns around studio interest in generative AI, delayed production and promotion of many film and TV projects. And the rise of streaming content pushed many media companies towards taking on debt and unwise mergers (see: Warner Bros. Discovery), which led to higher subscription costs, layoffs and production belt-tightening.How can a troubled media company survive today? The answer seems to be further consolidation. Amazon&#39;s $8.45 billion MGM takeover in 2022 heralded future deals, like Skydance&#39;s $8 billion acquisition of Paramount . But Netflix&#39;s WB deal goes even further: It could fundamentally reshape the media industry as we know it, from theatrical movie-going to the existence of physical media.What will the Netflix and Warner Bros. deal include? After next year&#39;s already-announced separation of Warner Bros. and Discovery, Netflix says it plans to acquire all of Warner Bros. remaining assets — including its film and TV studios, HBO Max and HBO — for $82.7 billion. According to Game Developer, representatives also say Warner Bros. Games, which includes Mortal Kombat developers NetherRealm, will also be part of the deal. Will the Netflix and Warner Bros. deal be approved by regulators?Even before the deal was formally announced, it was clear that whoever bought WB would be facing government opposition from every side. Yesterday, Paramount sent WB a letter questioning the &#34;fairness and adequacy&#34; of the acquisition bidding process (which also included Comcast as a potential buyer). Afterwards, the New York Post reported that Paramount CEO David Ellison, son of the Trump-boosting Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, met with administration officials to make his case for buying Netflix. As of this morning, the Trump administration views the Netflix/WB deal with &#34;heavy skepticism,&#34; an official tells CNBC.On the other side of the aisle, Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has called the Netflix/WB deal an &#34;anti-monopoly nightmare.&#34; She added, &#34;A Netflix-Warner Bros. would create one massive media giant with control of close to half of the streaming market. It could force you into higher prices, fewer choices over what and how you watch, and may put American workers at risk.&#34; At this point, it&#39;s too early to tell if the Netflix/WB deal will make it past regulators, but it&#39;s clear that both companies should prepare for a rocky approval process.What does the Netflix and Warner Bros. deal mean for streaming video? According to data from JustWatch, a combined Netflix and HBO would account for 33 percent of the US streaming video market, putting it ahead of Prime Video&#39;s 21 percent share. As for how the two media companies would co-exist, Netflix says it will &#34;maintain Warner Bros. current businesses,&#34; which includes HBO Max and HBO, theatrical releases for films and well as movie and TV studio operations. JustWatch streaming video market stats.JustWatch&#34;We think it’s too early to talk specifics about how we’re going to tailor this offering for consumers,&#34; Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters said in an investor call this morning, when asked if HBO would remain a separate service. &#34;Needless to say, we think the HBO brand is very powerful, and would constitute part of our plan for consumers. That then gives us a lot of options to figure out how to package things to offer the best options for consumers.&#34;At the very least, we can expect increased prices across the board for HBO and Netflix. There&#39;s also potential for the company to offer combination subscriptions, similar to how Disney juggles Disney+, Hulu and ESPN. What does the Netflix and Warner Bros. deal mean for theaters?In short, a combined Netflix/WB wouldn&#39;t be great for theaters. Previous mergers, like Disney and Fox&#39;s union, led to fewer theatrical releases, not more. Since its transformation into a streaming-first company, Netflix has also been primarily focused on increasing subscriptions and engagement, with theatrical releases of its original content treated as an afterthought. &#34;We’ve released about 30 films into theaters this year, so it’s not like we have opposition to theatrical release,&#34; Netflix Co-CEO Ted Sarandos said in the investor call (without specifying how short some of those theatrical releases were). &#34;It’s the longer windows that aren’t consumer friendly. Life cycle that starts in the movie theater, we’ll continue that. Over time, the windows will evolve to be much more consumer friendly, to meet the audience where we are.&#34;He added: &#34;All things that are going to theaters through WB will continue to do so. Our primary goal is to bring first-run movies to consumers, and we intend to continue with that.&#34; In an April interview at the Time100 Summit, Sarandos also famously called the theatrical model &#34;outdated,&#34; since most people in the US can&#39;t easily walk to a multiplex. Cinema United, a trade group representing over 30,000 movie theater screens in the US, is unsurprisingly against the entire deal. “The proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. by Netflix poses an unprecedented threat to the global exhibition business. The negative impact of this acquisition will impact theatres from the biggest circuits to one-screen independents in small towns in the United States and around the world,” Cinema United President and CEO Michael O’Leary said in a statement. “Cinema United stands ready to support industry changes that lead to increased movie production and give consumers more opportunities to enjoy a day at the local theatre,” he added. “But Netflix’s stated business model does not support theatrical exhibition. In fact, it is the opposite. Regulators must look closely at the specifics of this proposed transaction and understand the negative impact it will have on consumers, exhibition and the entertainment industry.”What do artists think of the Netflix and WB deal?Writers, directors and producers are already having a tough time getting projects off the ground, so having one less place to pitch isn&#39;t going to help. There are also a handful of artists, including former WB darling Christopher Nolan, who have refused to work with Netflix entirely. &#34;The end goal of these consolidations is to limit choices in entertainment to a select handful of providers, so they can capture our whole attention, and thus our every available dollar,&#34; C. Robert Cargill, the screenwriter behind Doctor Strange and The Black Phone, said in a statement to Engadget. &#34;The result will be a gutting of diversity and fresh voices in the industry, sending thousands, if not tens of thousands, of people back to their home towns to start their lives over, as there simply isn&#39;t a place for them in Hollywood any more, while homogenizing film and television into the &#34;content&#34; word we all grumble about hearing.&#34;&#34;WB has made so many daring choices this year, with executives taking big risks that made real cultural and financial impacts at the box office,&#34; he added. &#34;And HBO, constant name changes be damned, is still making some of the best television there is, bar none. Will those creative environments survive the merger, or will many of those brilliant execs be sent packing along with the writers, directors, and crews?&#34; &#34;In short, it&#39;s a very scary and heartbreaking time to be a filmmaker. No shade on Netflix and the people that work there; it&#39;s just that less choice in entertainment always makes for fewer winners and more people on the outside looking in.&#34;What about physical media?Other than noting that Netflix used to be a DVD-by-mail company, there was no mention of physical media on the acquisition&#39;s press release or investor call. That’s not too surprising, as physical releases have always been an afterthought for Netflix. A few of its films, like Roma and Frances Ha, are available as discs through the Criterion Collection, and some shows like Stranger Things are also on DVD and Blu-ray. Netflix claims it&#39;ll continue to run WB&#39;s businesses as usual if the deal goes through, which should include physical media, but those sorts of pre-acquisition promises rarely last for long. WB&#39;s home video business isn&#39;t entirely its own, either: In 2020, it formed the joint venture Studio Distribution Services with Universal, which also handles physical media distribution for Sony Pictures, PBS and Neon.Given the slowing demand for physical media, it’s likely one of the first things a combined Netflix/WB would eventually drop. But there’s also been a resurgence of premium physical releases from distributors like Arrow Video, so there’s a chance Netflix may want to keep it around for special releases.Steve Dent contributed to this report.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/the-netflix-and-warner-bros-deal-might-be-great-for-shareholders-but-not-for-anyone-else-183000247.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2F2025-12%2Fa95cb6da-6b41-4ee3-be7f-8ac7825ed9d5&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=62109c1d2d1796d297e73f94776ef1fa21324981,https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/the-netflix-and-warner-bros-deal-might-be-great-for-shareholders-but-not-for-anyone-else-183000247.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-05T18:30:00Z,10,Tech

Get three months of Apple Music for only $1 right now,"Looking to switch music streaming platforms for no real reason? Apple Music is holding one heck of a sale right now. You can get three months of use for just $1. There are some caveats, as this is only for new users on the individual plan. Students and family plans don&#39;t count for this. 
Also, this has to be redeemed on iPhone, iPad or Mac. When you click the link it&#39;ll open up the Apple Music app, so click it from an Apple product to get the deal. Finally, it auto-renews after 90 days at $11 per month. Make sure to cancel ahead of time if you aren&#39;t enjoying the service. 

  
As for Apple Music, it&#39;s one of the best music streaming platforms out there and certainly a perfect choice for those already tied to the Apple ecosystem. It lets you import your own files, which is great for anyone still hanging on to an iTunes library. Otherwise, it offers streaming access to millions upon millions songs like all the rest. It does, however, include some live radio stations staffed by actual people, which is cool. 
The app works with Android devices, but it&#39;s really designed for Apple products. We also found the spatial audio to sound unnatural at times, but that&#39;s partly a limitation of the tech.

More Studio Ghibli 4K restorations are coming to IMAX in 2026,"IMAX and animation distributor GKids are bringing more 4K Studio Ghibli restorations to the largest screens in 2026. The announcement follows the IMAX release of Princess Mononoke this year, with the ongoing restorations being directly supervised by Studio Ghibli’s Atsushi Okui, who’s been with the company since 1993.
Okui was the Director of Digital Imaging on 2023’s The Boy and the Heron, which was also the first Ghibli picture to get the IMAX treatment. The likes of My Neighbour Totoro and Spirited Away have also had theatrical re-releases in recent years. GKids heads up distribution in North America for the Japanese animation giant’s films across all platforms, and has been working with IMAX on various projects since 2021.
It sounds like the remaining Ghibli titles set for theatrical IMAX releases in the US will arrive one at a time, and GKids is not saying how many we can expect, or what it’s following Princess Mononoke with next year. I did a quick check for notable upcoming anniversaries, and 2026 does mark 40 years of Castle in the Sky, but one of the studio’s newer films might be a more obvious guess for a 4K refurb. Time will tell.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/more-studio-ghibli-4k-restorations-are-coming-to-imax-in-2026-174508476.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F1344b160-d1ff-11f0-a77c-d08e809fcdc0&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=0603a3f4a803a44abc7f1bbb6d3372a8b711f8f9,https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/more-studio-ghibli-4k-restorations-are-coming-to-imax-in-2026-174508476.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-05T17:45:08Z,7,Tech

India is reportedly considering another draconian smartphone surveillance plan,"You know what they say: If at first you don&#39;t succeed at mass government surveillance, try, try again. Only two days after India backpedaled on its plan to force smartphone makers to preinstall a state-run &#34;cybersecurity&#34; app, Reuters reports that the country is back at it. It’s said to be considering a telecom industry proposal with another draconian requirement. This one would require smartphone makers to enable always-on satellite-based location tracking (Assisted GPS).The measure would require location services to remain on at all times, with no option to switch them off. The telecom industry also wants phone makers to disable notifications that alert users when their carriers have accessed their location.  According to Reuters, India&#39;s home ministry was set to meet with smartphone industry executives on Friday, but the meeting was postponed.India&#39;s Prime Minister Narendra Modi appears on a screen to deliver a speech remotely as other leaders attend the 22nd ASEAN - India Summit during the 47th Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Summit in Kuala Lumpur on October 26, 2025. (Photo by Rafiq Maqbool / POOL / AFP) (Photo by RAFIQ MAQBOOL/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)          RAFIQ MAQBOOL via Getty ImagesPredictably, proponents claim the plan is about helping law enforcement keep you safe from the bad guys. (See also: Orwell&#39;s Nineteen Eighty-Four.) The administration of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has long been concerned that law enforcement agencies can’t obtain precise enough locations during investigations. Cell tower data alone can be off by several meters. And hey, what&#39;s the privacy of 1.4 billion people next to tracking criminals with an extra 10 ft. or so of accuracy, right?Apple, Google and Samsung are said to oppose the move and have urged the Modi government to reject it. The lobbying group India Cellular &amp; Electronics Association (ICEA), which represents them, reportedly wrote in a confidential letter this summer that the proposal has no precedent anywhere in the world.

The best iPad deals this week include $100 off the iPad Air M3,"We generally think iPads are the best tablets for most people, but they usually don’t come cheap. To help those looking to grab one today get the most value possible, we’re keeping an eye on sale prices and rounding up the best iPad deals we can find each week. 
Hopefully you were able to snag whatever iPad you’ve been eyeing at some point in the last couple of weeks, as most of the all-time lows we saw during Black Friday and Cyber Monday have expired. If you were late to the party, though, there are still some savings to be had, including $100 off both iPad Air models and an all-time low for the 13-inch iPad Pro. Beyond tablets, other Apple devices like the AirPods 4 with ANC, Apple Watch SE 3 and Apple Pencil Pro are still on sale at their Black Friday prices. Here are all of the top deals on Apple gear we could find this week. 
Best iPad deals 

  
Apple iPad Air (13-inch, M3) for $699 ($100 off MSRP): The 13-inch iPad Air is exactly the same as its smaller counterpart, only it has a larger and slightly brighter display. We gave it a review score of 89 earlier this year. This deal is $50 above the discount we saw on Black Friday but still $100 cheaper than buying from Apple directly. Also at B&amp;H. 
Apple iPad Pro (11-inch, M5) for $927 ($72 off): The latest iPad Pro is still far more tablet than most people need, but its class-leading OLED display, impressively thin design and super-powerful M5 chip make it a luxury experience for those who can afford it. This 11-inch model sold for $899 during Black Friday, but the device was only released in October, so any sort of savings is still noteworthy. Also at Best Buy for $949. 
Apple iPad Pro (13-inch, M5) for $1,199 ($100 off): It’s not a massive discount, but this matches the lowest price so far for the larger iPad Pro, which may be worthwhile if you’ve got cash to burn and want to use an iPad as your main computer. We gave it a score of 85 in our review. Also at B&amp;H. 
Best Apple deals 

  
Apple Watch SE 3 for $199 ($50 off): This discount has been around for a few weeks, but it’s the lowest price to date for Apple’s newest entry-level smartwatch. We gave this device a score of 90 in our review last month: The big upgrade is an always-on display, which makes it so you no longer have to wake the watch to check the time or notifications. It still includes most of the essential health and fitness features beyond that, plus it now runs on the same chipset as the higher-end Apple Watch Series 11. Also at Walmart. 
Apple Watch Series 11 for $329 ($70 off): The SE 3 may be a better raw value, but the Apple Watch Series 11 remains our preferred smartwatch overall for iPhone owners. Compared to its cheaper sibling, it has a bigger, brighter and more scratch-resistant display, longer battery life and a few advanced health features like an ECG app and hypertension alerts. It also earned a score of 90 in our review. This is an all-time low for the standard 42mm model, but keep in mind that there’s no pressing need to upgrade if you already own a Series 10. Also at Walmart. 
Apple Pencil Pro for $95 ($34 off): The Pencil Pro is Apple’s most feature-rich stylus, offering pressure sensitivity, wireless charging, haptic feedback and unique gesture controls compared to the standard USB-C model (which isn’t significantly discounted). Just note that it’s not compatible with the entry-level iPad and other older models. While this discount is only $5 below the device’s usual street price, it’s still the largest discount we’ve seen this year. Also at Walmart. 

  
Apple MacBook Pro (14-inch, M5) for $1,349 ($250 off): The newest MacBook Pro is the “best high-end” pick in our laptop buying guide and a fine choice for creative types who need something more powerful than the MacBook Air. The latter is still a much better value for most people, but the Pro gets you a superior mini-LED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, more ports and improved performance, especially with GPU-intensive tasks. It can even hold its own with certain games, though it’s noticeably thicker and heavier than the Air. We gave it a score of 92 in our review. This deal matches the lowest price to date for a configuration with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. Also at Walmart. 
Apple Mac mini (M4) for $679 ($100 off): The latest iteration of Apple’s tiny desktop PC has a smaller footprint, a faster M4 chip, 16GB of RAM by default, two front-facing USB-C ports and an extra Thunderbolt 4 port. It can also drive three external displays, though it lacks USB-A ports entirely. We gave a higher-end model with Apple’s M4 Pro chip a score of 90 in our review. This deal marks the lowest price we could find for a configuration with the base M4 chip, 24GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD.

Meta cuts deals with several news publishers for AI use,"Meta has cut several deals with news publishers to help provide real-time data for its AI chatbot services, as reported by Axios. The commercial agreements will allow its Meta AI chatbots to better answer user queries about news and current events.
These are multiyear deals where publishers will be compensated for the use of their content, but we don&#39;t have any monetary specifics. The contracts do stipulate that Meta&#39;s chatbots will link out to articles when answering news queries, potentially offering a slight traffic boost to publishers.
The news partners include USA Today, People, Le Monde and CNN. However, there are also a whole lot of conservative outlets included in today&#39;s announcement, such as Fox News, The Daily Caller and Washington Examiner. It&#39;s a good thing Meta&#39;s AI will provide the aforementioned links, just in case a chatbot says something crazy about whatever nonsense culture war topic is going on that day.
Meta has announced that this is just a first step and that it will be adding more news partners to cover more topics in the future. This is an interesting move because Meta has long-been averse to paying news companies for access to content. It stopped paying US publishers for access to news in 2022 and the Facebook news tab went away entirely last year.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/meta-cuts-deals-with-several-news-publishers-for-ai-use-163404107.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2Fba1eee20-d1f4-11f0-bb7e-5d1ee6357e06&resize=1400%2C994&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=aa29849d5d8c064d08e2a7df309feff6a251b7f0,https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/meta-cuts-deals-with-several-news-publishers-for-ai-use-163404107.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-05T16:34:04Z,7,Tech

Hardening browser security with zero-trust controls,"
		
					  
						




The shift from perimeter-based security to zero trust is now indispensable for combating modern threats. The obsolete “castle-and-moat” model, granting implicit trust to any device or user inside the network, collapsed with the rise of cloud, remote work and BYOD. Attackers now bypass traditional controls by targeting identity, exploiting AI-driven phishing, supply chain intrusions and advanced session hijacking.



The browser is at this frontline, serving as the universal access point for SaaS, developer tools and sensitive AI resources. As data from diverse trust domains converge, each access request demands rigorous, real-time validation of identity, device posture and behavior.



NIST SP 800-207 provides the model: decouple access from network location by using a policy engine, policy administrator and browser-based policy enforcement point to enforce dynamic, context-aware authorization. NIST SP 800-207A extends this to runtime control across multi-cloud and microservices. Simultaneously, CISA’s Zero Trust Maturity Model v2 maps a clear implementation path spanning five pillars and emphasizing automation, analytics and governance as essential enablers.



This journal unites these leading standards with current enterprise practices, delivering a comprehensive browser-first ZTA framework that balances least-privileged access, SSO/MFA, device compliance and session isolation for secure, adaptable operations.



The imperative for browser-centric zero trust



As remote work and cloud adoption become the default operating model, the inability of implicit network trust and legacy VPNs to address the modern attack surface is undeniable. Adversaries now target the browser directly with attacks like cross-site scripting (XSS), session hijacking via stolen tokens and advanced phishing that bypasses traditional MFA. A browser-centric ZTA framework is the necessary response, built on the following six principles.



1. Identity-first access control



Network proximity is now an inferior trust signal. Only federated, cryptographically verifiable identity tokens issued by centralized enterprise IdPs using OIDC or SAML are permitted as gates to corporate resources. This transition, well-documented by FIDO Alliance and Microsoft research, transfers the very concept of “inside” the organization from the network to the user’s validated persona. No session proceeds without a signed, short-lived identity claim.



2. Least-privileged access (LPA)



Legacy roles that confer standing privileges are antithetical to zero trust. LPA decrees that entitlements are minimized, time-bounded and context-aware. The application of just-in-time access, JWT token scoping and dynamic risk assessment ensures users receive only what is necessary for their current task, never more. Device state, resource value and behavior all adjust privilege in flight: a noncompliant device or anomalous login instantly narrows the access window.



3. Continuous verification and adaptive policy



Zero trust is not “authenticate once, trust forever.” It is a continuous cycle of verification. Adaptive policy rules, executed by the policy engine, must re-evaluate access in real-time based on new telemetry. This “posture drift” can be triggered by numerous signals:




Behavioral: If a user typically logs in from Texas at 9 am but suddenly authenticates from Eastern Europe at 3 am (“impossible travel”), adaptive rules flag the anomaly and restrict access.



Device: An EDR agent detects a malicious process, changing the device’s health state from “compliant” to “at-risk.”



Network: A user moves from a trusted corporate network to an untrusted public Wi-Fi hotspot. In response, the PE can automatically initiate a session revocation, force a step-up MFA challenge or reduce the session to read-only.




4. Integrated phishing-resistant authentication



To secure the identity-first gate, the authentication method itself must be robust. Traditional MFA (like SMS or one-time passcodes) is phishable. The ZTA browser model mandates the adoption of phishing-resistant MFA, primarily through FIDO2/WebAuthn passkeys. As detailed by the FIDO Alliance, passkeys are a W3C standard that replaces passwords with cryptographic key pairs. The private key never leaves the user’s device (e.g., a YubiKey, a phone’s secure enclave or a Windows Hello TPM), making it impossible to phish. The user authenticates with a simple biometric or PIN, providing unparalleled security with a superior user experience. By 2025, passkey adoption will have moved from emerging to mainstream, with deployments showing authentication times under two seconds and proven reductions in phishing-related losses.



5. Device health gating



A trusted user on a compromised device is a critical threat. The ZTA model must validate the endpoint before issuing an access token. This “device health gating” is a cornerstone of modern IdP solutions. The conditional access policy engine queries the device for posture signals collected by an MDM (mobile device management) or EDR (endpoint detection and response) agent. As documented in Microsoft’s conditional access framework, policies enforce compliance before token issuance. Key signals include:




Patch level: Is the OS fully patched?



EDR status: Is the EDR agent (e.g., CrowdStrike, Defender) running and reporting no active threats?



Disk encryption: Is the primary drive encrypted (e.g., BitLocker, FileVault)?



Device state: Is the device jailbroken or rooted? Only devices that meet this baseline are considered “compliant” and eligible for access.




6. Remote browser isolation (RBI)



For the highest-risk activities, we must assume the endpoint cannot be fully trusted and that web content is malicious. Remote browser isolation (RBI) addresses this by executing risky or privileged web sessions in isolated, disposable cloud containers. The user’s endpoint never interacts with active web code; it only receives a stream of pixels (pixel-streaming RBI) or a sanitized, reconstructed version of the page (DOM-reconstruction RBI). As demonstrated by zero trust solutions like Cloudflare RBI, this neutralizes all browser-based exploits, prevents malware from reaching the endpoint and can enforce data loss prevention (DLP) by disabling copy/paste or uploads from the isolated session.



Modern workflows and policy patterns: A blueprint



A modern ZTA browser architecture is not a single product but an integrated system that operates on a continuous, per-request verification loop.



This is the foundational user-facing workflow for all access.




Request: A user on a managed browser (e.g., Chrome Enterprise) attempts to access a protected app (e.g., test.company.com).



Intercept &amp; redirect: An access proxy (ZTNA/PEP), like Cloudflare Access or Zscaler Private Access, intercepts the request. Seeing no valid session token, it redirects the browser to the enterprise IdP (e.g., Okta, Entra ID) to initiate an OIDC or SAML authentication flow.



Authentication: The IdP authenticates the user. Based on policy, it requires a phishing-resistant MFA step using a FIDO2/WebAuthn passkey. The user taps their YubiKey or uses Windows Hello.



Contextual evaluation: The IdP’s Conditional Access Policy Engine (PE) evaluates the request. It queries the Microsoft Intune or CrowdStrike ZTA integration for device posture. The policy is: ALLOW IF (user_group == ‘Sales’) AND (device_status == ‘Compliant’) AND (auth_method == ‘FIDO2’).



Token issuance: Upon success, the IdP mints a signed JSON Web Token (JWT). This token contains critical claims: the user’s ID (sub), their roles (groups), the authentication method (amr) and a short-lived expiration (exp).



Access granted: Browser supplies JWT to proxy, proxy grants direct, secure application access.




B. Adaptive session management and least privilege



This workflow demonstrates the “continuous verification” principle.




Scenario 1 — Posture drift: The user is authenticated and working. Midway through the session, their EDR agent detects a high-priority threat (e.g., malware execution). The EDR agent instantly updates the device’s health state. The IdP’s conditional access, which leverages a continuous access evaluation protocol (CAEP), receives this signal and immediately revokes all active session tokens for that device, forcing a logout and remediation.



Scenario 2 — Step-up authentication: A user with a valid session for a low-risk app (like a wiki) clicks a link to a high-risk app (like the SAP admin console). The ZTNA proxy (PEP) intercepts this new request, recognizes the “Tier 0” sensitivity of the application and re-challenges the user, forcing a new step-up authentication with a hardware passkey before proceeding, even though they already have an active SSO session.




C. Privileged and sensitive operations via isolation



This workflow is for protecting “Tier 0” assets like administrator consoles.




Request: An administrator attempts to access the Okta admin console or an internal Kubernetes dashboard.



Policy enforcement: After successful FIDO2 authentication, the ZTNA policy (PEP) for this “Tier 0” application is configured not with an “Allow” action, but with an “Isolate” action.



Isolation: The user is transparently routed to an RBI service. The entire admin session is executed in a secure, disposable container in the cloud. Only benign pixels are streamed to the end-user’s browser.



DLP &amp; threat neutralization: This mitigates two critical risks:

Endpoint Malware: If the admin’s workstation is compromised, keyloggers or token-stealing malware cannot access the privileged session, as it’s not running locally.



Data Exfiltration: Granular RBI policies are applied: copy/paste, file downloads and printing are disabled for this session, preventing accidental or malicious credential or data leakage.






D. Forward-thinking SCIM provisioning



This workflow is the automation backbone that makes LPA viable at scale.




System for cross-domain identity management (SCIM) is an open standard (RFC 7643) for automating the exchange of user identity information between systems. The SCIM protocol (RFC 7643) defines a REST API and schema for managing user and group resources.



The Workflow (Joiner/Mover/Leaver):

Source event: A manager in the HRIS (e.g., Workday) changes an employee’s role from “Sales Rep” to “Sales Manager.”



SCIM push: The HRIS (or an integration layer) automatically triggers a SCIM PATCH request to the IdP (Okta, Entra ID).



IdP update: The IdP updates the user’s attributes, removing them from the group:sales-rep and adding them to the group:sales-manager.



Policy propagation: The IdP’s Policy Engine (PE) immediately uses this new attribute data.



Re-evaluation: The next time the user authenticates (or their token expires), their access is re-evaluated. Their old access to rep-level tools is gone, and their new access to manager dashboards is automatically granted. This “Just-in-Time” provisioning prevents “privilege creep” and ensures all access decisions are based on accurate, real-time identity data.






Maturity pathways: Roadmap to optimal state



This roadmap, aligned with the CISA ZTMM v2, allows organizations to make measurable, incremental progress.




Initial: At this stage, the organization moves beyond the “Traditional” perimeter. All browser-accessed applications are federated with a central IdP and protected by an access proxy (ZTNA). SSO and passkey-based FIDO2/WebAuthn MFA are mandatory for all users. All access logs are centralized in a SIEM. This achieves the Identity and Network pillar foundations.



Advanced: The organization builds on the initial foundation with richer context. Device compliance (via Intune/CrowdStrike integration) is enforced for all sessions. Policy decisions become adaptive, leveraging real-time telemetry from EDR and user behavior analytics (UBA). SCIM is fully implemented for automated provisioning from an identity source of truth (e.g., HRIS). This demonstrates maturity in the Devices and Automation capabilities.



Optimal: At the highest level of maturity, access is determined on a per-request, least-privilege basis, fully aligning with NIST 800-207A. RBI is automatically and transparently enforced for all privileged, unmanaged or high-risk web sessions. The entire ecosystem is automated, with post-authentication security (like token theft detection and CAEP) fully integrated. This represents an optimal state across all CISA pillars, driven by robust automation and governance.




Operationalizing ZTA browser security



Implementing this architecture requires a shift in operational thinking.




Policy design: Move from network rules to a “who, what, where, when, why” logic model. Policies should be readable statements: GRANT access IF (user_group == ‘Finance’) AND (app == ‘SAP’) AND (device_status == ‘Compliant’) AND (auth_method == ‘FIDO2’). Start with a default “deny” and create explicit “allow” rules, creating a policy matrix that maps user personas to data and applications.



Dynamic access: Token claims must be context-bound and short-lived. A token issued for a read-only wiki should not be valid for accessing a finance application. True phishing resistance requires eliminating all phishable recovery methods. This means deprecating SMS, email links and security questions in favor of passkey-based recovery or in-person identity verification.



Risk automation: Session adaptation (step-up, revocation) must be triggered by automated analytics. Integrate the IdP and ZTNA solution with your SIEM/SOAR platform. An EDR alert (e.g., “high-severity malware”) or a UBA alert (e.g., “impossible travel”) should automatically trigger a SOAR playbook that calls the IdP’s API to revoke the user’s session tokens.



Governance-as-code: Policies must not be managed via manual “click-ops” in a GUI. All ZTNA access rules, IdP Conditional Access policies and RBI configurations should be defined as code (e.g., using Terraform, HCL or JSON). This enables version control, peer review (via pull requests) and automated CI/CD pipelines, aligning with CISA’s cross-cutting controls for governance and automation.




Configuration patterns (Latest, 2025)




Chrome Enterprise: Use Chrome Browser Cloud Management to enforce a secure baseline on all corporate browsers. Enforce policies like BrowserSignin (to force login to a managed profile), PasswordManagerEnabled (set to false to mandate use of an enterprise password manager), SafeBrowsingProtectionLevel (set to Enhanced) and BuiltInDnsClientEnabled (to enforce secure DNS). Google’s Chrome Enterprise policies provide the full list of controls to manage extensions, data leakage and security settings.



Intune/conditional access: Create a non-negotiable “baseline” policy: Require compliant device and Require phishing-resistant MFA for all users accessing all cloud apps. Then, create more granular policies. For example, block access entirely from high-risk countries or require a “Compliant + Hybrid Joined” device for access to legacy on-prem apps.



FIDO2/WebAuthn passkeys: Deploy passkeys (platform-based like Windows Hello and hardware-bound like YubiKeys) as the primary authenticator. Start with privileged users (admins) and high-value targets (executives, finance) first, then roll out to the general population.



Cloudflare RBI/ZTNA: Configure clientless ZTNA to secure third-party and BYOD access without requiring an agent. Use Service Auth policies (based on mTLS certificates or service tokens) to secure non-human (RPA bot) access to web applications. Configure a “default-isolate” policy that automatically sends all traffic to unclassified or high-risk domains through the RBI service.



SCIM automation: Connect your IdP (Okta, Entra ID) to your source of truth (e.g., Workday) via a pre-built SCIM connector. Map HR attributes (e.g., Department, Role, EmploymentStatus) to IdP attributes. Use these attributes to drive dynamic group membership, which in turn drives all application access and ZTNA policies.




The browser is now both sword and shield



Browser security is the linchpin for zero trust and organizational resilience. By converging validated identity, rigorous device posture, adaptive access policies, automated provisioning and session isolation, we not only defend against the sophisticated threats of 2025 but also set a foundation for scalable, measurable governance.



In moving from static perimeters to live, session-level policy enforcement, every click and credential is scrutinized, every privilege time-boxed, every access revocable by context and behavior not convenience or legacy. Teams must treat the browser not as an exposed window, but as the policy stronghold of the modern enterprise. 



Building toward this architecture is a journey: Begin with SSO and robust MFA, enforce device compliance, automate provisioning and integrate RBI where risk justifies isolation. Codify policy, automate telemetry and develop governance as code. Refuse the ‘trusted network’ myth. Zero trust is here, and the browser is now both sword and shield.

X hit with $140 million fine from the EU,"The European Commission has fined Elon Musk’s X €120 million (around $140 million) for breaching its transparency rules under the Digital Services Act. The European Union’s executive arm announced that it was investigating the social media company’s blue checkmarking verification system — first introduced when it was still known as Twitter —  last year, along with other alleged DSA violations. Today’s verdict concerns the &#34;deceptive design&#34; of the checkmark, as well as &#34;the lack of transparency of [X&#39;s] advertising repository, and the failure to provide access to public data for researchers.&#34;
The Commission&#39;s issue with X’s verification system is that where blue checkmarks were once something that Twitter that Twitter vetted, they can now be bough by anyone. According to the EU, this puts users at risk of scams and impersonation fraud, as they can’t tell if the accounts they’re engaging with are authentic. &#34;While the DSA does not mandate user verification, it clearly prohibits online platforms from falsely claiming that users have been verified, when no such verification took place,&#34; it wrote in a statement.
The EU has also ruled that X’s advertisement repository employs &#34;design features and access barriers&#34; that make it difficult for good faith actors and the general public to determine the source of online ads and spot scams or threat campaigns. It says that X fails to provide information pertaining to both the content of an ad and the entity paying for its placement.
The third alleged infringement concerns the public data that companies are required by the DSA to make available to qualifying researchers. The European Commission claims that X’s practices in this area are unnecessarily prohibitive, therefore &#34;effectively undermining research into several systemic risks in the European Union.&#34;
X has 60 working days to respond to the EU’s non-compliance decision — the first of its nature — on blue checkmarks, and 90 days to submit an &#34;action plan&#34; of how it will address the alleged breaches relating to its advertising repository and access to public data. Failure to comply could result in financial penalties.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/x-hit-with-140-million-fine-from-the-eu-161259324.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2Fdf22dc60-d1f2-11f0-bf8f-335308077340&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=5f7433bbbb4c7e0e95bcbd32eff272e870690d77,https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/x-hit-with-140-million-fine-from-the-eu-161259324.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-05T16:12:59Z,7,Tech

How much are 2026 World Cup tickets? 
Currently, individual tickets for the 2026 World Cup run anywhere from $1,400 to $3,500 (if you&#39;re searching for tickets for matches in Mexico or Canada, don&#39;t be scared off by their higher price tags — they&#39;re all in the same price range after adjusting for conversion rates). Tickets for the group stage, knockout rounds, and the bronze final are currently available. It&#39;s important to note that FIFA is employing a dynamic pricing strategy, so prices may fluctuate as we get closer to the tournament, depending on demand. For those lucky enough to enter and be selected in the ticketing lottery, prices are significantly less – they&#39;re broken out into four categories based on seating, and range from $60 to $620, but these prices are not available to the general public.  
Hospitality packages, which guarantee entry to multiple matches are also on sale now and start at $5,300. (Note that depending on the venue and package you select, some of these packages can cost up to $68,000 per person, and while that price includes food, drinks and premium seating, it doesn&#39;t include travel expenses or accommodations.)  
Tickets are also available through FIFA&#39;s own resale marketplace and on third-party resale sites like StubHub already have single-game matches available, with some starting around $275 per seat and going up from there, depending on the game and venue.  Find tickets on StubHub

The New York Times and Chicago Tribune sue Perplexity over alleged copyright infringement,"The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune have filed separate lawsuits against Perplexity over alleged copyright infringement. The Times said it had sent Perplexity several cease-and-desist demands to stop using its content until the two reached an agreement, but the AI company persisted in doing so. In the lawsuit [PDF], the Times accused Perplexity of infringing on its copyrights at two main stages. First, by scraping its website (including in real time) to train AI models and feed content into the likes of the Claude chatbot and Comet browser. Second, in the output of Perplexity&#39;s products, with the Times accusing the company’s generative AI products of often reproducing its articles verbatim. The Times also says Perplexity damaged its brand by falsely attributing completely fabricated information (aka hallucinations) to the newspaper.The Chicago Tribune also filed a lawsuit against Perplexity for similar reasons. &#34;Perplexity’s genAI products generate outputs that are identical or substantially similar to the Chicago Tribune’s content,” the newspaper claimed in its suit. “Upon information and belief, Perplexity has unlawfully copied millions of copyrighted Chicago Tribune stories, videos, images and other works to power its products and tools.&#34;These lawsuits are the latest in dozens of legal cases involving copyright holders and AI companies in the US. The Times, for instance, previously sued OpenAI and Microsoft. It accused the companies of training their large language models on millions of its articles without permission. That case is ongoing.Copyright holders have licensed their content to AI companies in some cases, though. OpenAI has struck multiple deals with media companies. The Times and Amazon reached an agreement this year that&#39;s said to be worth as much as $25 million per year to the media company.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/the-new-york-times-and-chicago-tribune-sue-perplexity-over-alleged-copyright-infringement-153656431.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2F2025-12%2Fa6f2f620-2679-4b68-a545-41779dbd28a3&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=48c927b6764ada75a315d89156f5c626a1c141b1,https://www.engadget.com/ai/the-new-york-times-and-chicago-tribune-sue-perplexity-over-alleged-copyright-infringement-153656431.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-05T15:36:56Z,7,Tech

Where the hell is Samsung's Ballie robot?,"Another CES is nearly upon us, another year where we’ll see new gadgets aplenty from giant companies and tiny ones you’ve never heard of. And the not-so-secret secret of CES is that many of these things never make it to market — but usually it isn’t things companies like Samsung show off. But here we are, nearly six years since Samsung first showed off its Ballie personal robot and it is nowhere to be found.For those who may not recall, Ballie is an adorable circular robot that can putter around your house and project things onto the floor and wall. It’s kind of a virtual assistant on the go. Samsung first revealed this tiny robot at CES 2020, but it was more of a prototype than something anyone expected to purchase. And then there was a global pandemic and we all sort of forgot about weird ball-shaped robots for a few. But Samsung triumphantly unveiled a larger and more refined Ballie at CES 2024, saying it would be on sale that year! Well, that didn’t happen, but a year later Ballie was back at CES again. Samsung promised it would go on sale in 2025, and followed up with a press release this past April saying it was on track for a summer launch in Korea and the US. As far as I can tell, that’s the last we’ve heard of it. But with CES looming again, I can’t help but feel like Samsung will roll Ballie out once more, trying to sell the dream of a cute robotic companion who just gets you. I spent some time watching Ballie do its thing in a carefully controlled demo at CES 2024, and I can’t say I was overwhelmed by its purported usefulness or thought there’d be much of a market for this thing. I now can’t help but wonder if Samsung has data backs up my intuition. If this thing was going to sell like gangbusters, it likely wouldn’t be subjected to such a long and public gestation period. It reminds me a little of one of my favorite Samsung gaffes, the Galaxy Home smart speaker. It was announced at a time when Apple and Google were challenging Sonos and Amazon with voice-activated speakers of their own, moving Siri or the Google Assistant from your phone to a more omnipresent place in your home. The first rumor of the Galaxy Home happened way back in 2017, and the speaker was officially revealed and briefly shown off by Samsung in August of 2018. My immediate reaction was that this product made very little sense for both Samsung and potential customers — Bibxy sucked, and there were plenty of speakers with better voice assistants. Apparently, Samsung agreed. After multiple years of vague commitments and references to the Galaxy Home, Samsung just… stopped talking about it. Oddly enough, a Galaxy Home Mini speaker was briefly released in South Korea, part of a promotion for people who pre-ordered the Galaxy S20. But I don’t think you could ever just walk into a store and buy one, and the larger Galaxy Home never materialized at all. Ballie isn’t quite the abandonware situation that the Galaxy Home was, at least not yet. After all, it’s only been about eight months since Samsung dropped that press release claiming it would arrive soon. The company has definitely pushed Ballie in a more public way than the Galaxy Home, making it a little harder to just drop entirely. Maybe we’ll see a revamped Ballie with even more weird tricks next month, or maybe we’ll just get another vague promise that it’ll arrive in 2026. After failing to deliver two years in a row, though, I’m not going to expect Ballie to show up as a real product until I can punch in my credit card and pre-order it... not that I’d do that anyway. Ballie needs to show that it’s a lot more than a cute rolling robot before Samsung gets my cash. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/where-the-hell-is-samsungs-ballie-robot-151112829.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2FBallie-Press-Release-1-1536x864.jpg&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=02d6f11da48fda471d96dae1b2e475a90304a467,https://www.engadget.com/ai/where-the-hell-is-samsungs-ballie-robot-151112829.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-05T15:11:12Z,7,Tech

Avoiding the next technical debt: Building AI governance before it breaks,"
		
					  
						




The AI rush is repeating a familiar mistake. Early in my career, a risk executive I worked with used to say, “You didn’t invite me to drink the beer; now you want me to pay the bill?” whenever problems came up because a project moved ahead without enough oversight. If someone tried to avoid explaining the details, he’d add, “I don’t know if you’re showing me the monster’s head or just its toe.”



Since 2011, I’ve watched new products, business services and innovations launch without enough security or risk checks. Cloud computing, big data, BYOD, APIs, IoT, social media and low-code are just a few examples. We usually innovate first and worry about governance later.



AI is following the same pattern. Leaders in many industries are excited about AI, just like they were with earlier technologies. But many still don’t have a clear way to track where AI is used, who owns the risks or how automated decisions could affect the business.



Ten years of fail fast have shown us the risks: more incidents, data breaches and bigger exposure. If organizations don’t build risk and accountability into AI now, they’ll face the same problems we saw with earlier innovations.



The real risk isn’t AI itself, it’s how we use it



Even with detailed frameworks like the MIT AI Risk Repository, many organizations still struggle to connect AI risks to real business problems. Everyone wants new use cases, but few are tracking where risks begin — in the data, the models or the quick decisions machines make.



In fact, AI risks aren’t just about the future — they’re already part of daily operations. These risks arise when algorithms affect business results without clear accountability, when tools collect sensitive data and when automated systems make decisions that people no longer check.



These governance gaps aren’t new. We saw the same issues with cloud, APIs, IoT and big data. The solution is also familiar: keep track, assess, control and monitor. The first step is knowing where AI is used, what data it handles and which processes it touches. With this visibility, governance becomes about managing what’s already in the business, not just fearing the unknown.



The next step is protection. We don’t need to reinvent the wheel or develop advanced new methods. Instead, we should start with the basics: with simple governance steps and then you can evolve your journey.



Borrow what already works



The good news is companies don’t have to start from scratch with AI governance. Guidelines for secure and compliant technology already exist in cybersecurity, cloud and privacy programs.



What’s needed is to apply traditional controls to this new context:




Classification and ownership. Every model should have a clear owner, with limits on who can train, query or deploy it. Its relevance to the business should be clear by different criteria, such as regulatory, operational or revenue.



Baseline security and non-negotiables. Access control, multifactor authentication, network segmentation and audit logging are just as important for AI environments as they are for servers or clouds.



Continuous monitoring. Model behavior should be more than just accurate — it should be observable, traceable and accountable for any changes in purpose.



Third-party due diligence. Contracts with AI providers should clearly define rights over training data, generated content and how to respond to incidents.



Testing and validation. Red-teaming, AI-specific penetration testing and scenario simulations should be regular practices.




These controls aren’t new, nor is the hope of avoiding another form of technical debt. Maybe this time we can apply the secure by design approach.



The same governance principles will be tested again soon; this time by a new wave of autonomous systems.



The rise of agent AI and the accountability vacuum



A new generation of agent AI systems can act on their own across different platforms, doing tasks, making purchases or retrieving data without direct human input. This move from simple chatbots to self-directed agents creates an accountability gap that most organizations aren’t ready for.



Without the right guardrails, an agent can access systems it shouldn’t, expose confidential data, create unreliable information, start unauthorized transactions, skip established workflows or even act against company policy or ethics. These risks are made worse by how fast and independently agent AI works, which can cause big problems before people notice.



In the rush to try new things, many companies launch these agents without basic access controls or oversight. The answer is to use proven controls like least privilege, segregation of duties, monitoring and accountability.



Executives should be able to answer fundamental questions, drawn from frameworks such as NIST AI RMF, about any autonomous AI operating in their environment:




What governance processes are in place (policies, roles and responsibilities, oversight)?



Which use cases and business applicability are being leveraged?



Who is accountable when it goes wrong?



Which risks does it represent? And which controls are applied?




Building governance into the business, not around it



Effective AI governance isn’t an IT function, any more than cybersecurity is. It’s a business function with shared accountability. Forward-looking organizations are now introducing three mechanisms that embed governance into operations:




AI self-assessment frameworks — simple checklists that help each business unit map their AI use cases, data sources and risks.



Leverage governance committees — cross-functional bodies with representation from risk, compliance, cybersecurity and business leaders.



Corporate AI use policies — defining approved tools, contractual standards and minimum safeguards for both internal and external AI usage.




These aren’t bureaucratic layers but foundations of sustainable innovation. When the business owns the inventory, risk teams can focus on assurance rather than discovery. Modern governance should enable adoption, not inhibit or slow it down, but help scale it safely.



Don’t build another debt



The similarities to cloud adoption are clear. Ten years ago, not having early controls led to exposed data, unmonitored systems and expensive fixes. AI is showing the same pattern, but it’s happening faster and with bigger consequences.



Technical debt isn’t just about code anymore. It’s also about trusting your data, holding models accountable and protecting your brand’s reputation.



The organizations that succeed with AI will be the ones that see governance as part of the design process, not as something that causes delays. They’ll move forward with clear plans and measure value and risk together.



They’ll see that real innovation isn’t just about building smarter systems but about making them safe, accountable and trusted from the start. For technology and business leaders, this isn’t just a security imperative. It’s a strategy for sustainable innovation.

AI in CI/CD pipelines can be tricked into behaving badly,"
		
					  
						




AI agents embedded in CI/CD pipelines can be tricked into executing high-privilege commands hidden in crafted GitHub issues or pull request texts.



Researchers at Aikido Security have traced the problem back to workflows that pair GitHub Actions or GitLab CI/CD with AI tools such as Gemini CLI, Claude Code Actions, OpenAI Codex Actions or GitHub AI Inference. They found that unsupervised user-supplied strings such as issue bodies, pull request descriptions, or commit messages, could be fed straight into prompts for AI agents in an attack they are calling PromptPwnd.



Depending on what the workflow lets the AI do, this can lead to unintended edits to repository content, disclosure of secrets, or other high-impact actions.



“AI agents connected to GitHub Actions/GitLAb CI/CD are processing untrusted user input, and executing shell commands with access to high-privilege tokens,” the researchers wrote in a blog post about PromptPwnd. They said they reproduced the problem in a test environment, and notified the affected vendors.



The researchers recommended running a set of open-source detection rules on suspected GitHub Action .yml files, or using their free code scanner on GitHub and GitLab repos.



Aikido Security said that Google had patched the issue in Gemini CLI upon being informed; Google did not immediately respond to a request for information about this.



Why PromptPwnd works



PromptPwnd exploits become possible when two flawed pipeline configurations occur together: when AI agents operating inside CI/CD workflows have access to powerful tokens (like GITHUB_TOKEN, cloud-access keys), and their prompts embed user-controlled fields.



Prompt injection becomes easier with such a setup, the researchers explained. An attacker can simply open an issue on a public repository and insert hidden instructions or seemingly innocent comments that double as commands for the model to pick. “Imagine you are sending a prompt to an LLM, and within that prompt, you are including the commit message,” the researchers said. “If that commit message is a malicious prompt, then you may be able to get the model to send back altered data.” The model’s response, if used directly inside commands to tools within CI/CD pipelines, can manipulate those tools to retrieve sensitive information.



Aikido Security demonstrated this in a controlled environment (without real tokens) to show that Gemini CLI could be manipulated into executing attacker-supplied commands and exposing sensitive credentials through a crafted GitHub issue. “Gemini CLI is not an isolated case. The same architecture pattern appears across many AI-powered GitHub Actions,” the researchers said, adding that the list included Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, and GitHub AI Inference.



All of these tools can be tricked (via issue, pull-request description, or other user-controlled text) into producing instructions that the workflow then executes with its privileged GitHub Actions token.



Mitigation plan



Aikido has open-sourced detection rules via their “Opengrep” tool that allows developers and security teams to scan their YAML workflows automatically, revealing whether they feed untrusted inputs into AI prompts.



The researchers said that only a subset of workflows have confirmed exploit paths so far, and that it is working with several other companies to address the underlying vulnerabilities. Some workflows can only be abused with collaborator-level access, while others can be triggered by anyone who files an issue or pull request.



Developer teams are advised to restrict what AI agents can do, avoid piping untrusted user content into prompts, treat AI output as untrusted code, and contain damage from compromised GitHub tokens.



Aikido Security said its code scanner can help flag these vulnerabilities by detecting unsafe GitHub Actions configurations (including risky AI prompt flows), identifying over-privileged tokens, and surfacing insecure CI/CD patterns via infrastructure-as-code scanning.



There are other best practices for securing CI/CD pipelines that enterprises can adopt, too.

Chinese Hackers Have Started Exploiting the Newly Disclosed React2Shell Vulnerability,"Two hacking groups with ties to China have been observed weaponizing the newly disclosed security flaw in React Server Components (RSC) within hours of it becoming public knowledge.
The vulnerability in question is CVE-2025-55182 (CVSS score: 10.0), aka React2Shell, which allows unauthenticated remote code execution. It has been addressed in React versions 19.0.1, 19.1.2, and 19.2.1.

Chinese hackers reportedly targeting government entities using 'Brickstorm' malware,"Hackers with links to China reportedly successfully infiltrated a number of unnamed government and tech entities using advanced malware. As reported by Reuters, cybersecurity agencies from the US and Canada confirmed the attack, which used a backdoor known as “Brickstorm” to target organizations using the VMware vSphere cloud computing platform.
As detailed in a report published by the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security on December 4, PRC state-sponsored hackers maintained &#34;long-term persistent access&#34; to an unnamed victim’s internal network. After compromising the affected platform, the cybercriminals were able to steal credentials, manipulate sensitive files and create &#34;rogue, hidden VMs&#34; (virtual machines), effectively seizing control unnoticed. The attack could have begun as far back as April 2024 and lasted until at least September of this year.
The malware analysis report published by the Canadian Cyber Centre, with assistance from The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the National Security Agency (NSA), cites eight different Brickstorm malware samples. It is not clear exactly how many organizations in total were either targeted or successfully penetrated.
In an email to Reuters, a spokesperson for VMware vSphere owner Broadcom said it was aware of the alleged hack, and encouraged its customers to download up-to-date security patches whenever possible. In September, the Google Threat Intelligence Group published its own report on Brickstorm, in which it urged organizations to &#34;reevaluate their threat model for appliances and conduct hunt exercises&#34; against specified threat actors.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/chinese-hackers-reportedly-targeting-government-entities-using-brickstorm-malware-133501894.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-07%2Fc488e060-643e-11f0-afff-e34962257558&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=32e7096c0d32491cce3f16cb90b3f0442a135b7b,https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/chinese-hackers-reportedly-targeting-government-entities-using-brickstorm-malware-133501894.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-05T13:35:01Z,10,Tech

Splitgate: Arena Reloaded tries to fix what Splitgate 2 broke,"Portal shooter Splitgate 2 is coming back with a new name and rebuilt experience after being pulled back to beta earlier this year, developer 1047 Games announced. The free-to-play Splitgate: Arena Reloaded will relaunch on December 17th across platforms including Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5 and PC. 
&#34;After months of community feedback, testing and rebuilding the entire experience, this is Splitgate refocused on what made it special in the first place: classic arena combat without factions, abilities, or extra noise,&#34; the developer shared in a blog post, along with a gameplay video. 

Splitgate 2 originally launched in June, but 1047 Games pulled it back to beta after deciding that the release had been rushed. For the new version, the company said, &#34;we took the best of Splitgate 1 and Splitgate 2&#34; and cut the parts that didn&#39;t fit, while refining the ones that did. &#34;in the process, we not only rebuilt the game, we reconnected with the magic of the genre that built this studio in the first place: a return to the Arena.&#34; 
Here are some key changes made:

Removed Splitgate 2&#39;s factions, abilities, and select equipment so the focus is back on classic arena combat without the extra noise.
Rebuilt progression from the ground up so your time in game feels rewarding, with weapon and character cosmetics you can earn simply by playing.
We&#39;ve added a true Classic Arena mode with even starts and new map pickups, recapturing the feel of the original.
Fine tuned combat to better match expectations for a modern arena shooter, with more meaningful gunfights and fewer &#34;what just happened&#34; moments.
Completely overhauled the ranked system so your rank reflects your actual skill for players who love to climb and compete.
Added key systems you have been asking for: Mode Select, Player Stats, Ranked Leaderboards, and Account Levels.
Introduced five brand new maps and six fully reworked arenas, bringing the total map pool to 20.
Added three new LMG primary weapons and the iconic Power Weapon, the Railgun.

1047 Games was savaged earlier this year by Splitgate players after co-founder Ian Proulx wore a hat at Summer Games Fest stating &#34;Make FPS Great Again.&#34; Later, he posted to the studio&#39;s X account on Splitgate 2&#39;s release date that he was &#34;not here to apologize&#34; and that the hat was &#34;not a political statement,&#34; finally admitting that it was all basically a publicity stunt.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/splitgate-arena-reloaded-tries-to-fix-what-splitgate-2-broke-130027714.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F8b42d940-d1c2-11f0-bdfe-2a2491d01519&resize=1400%2C778&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=2c21e707fe5f47ec7ceae515df0c7c73d3e5e53e,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/splitgate-arena-reloaded-tries-to-fix-what-splitgate-2-broke-130027714.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-05T13:00:27Z,7,Tech
"Microsoft's Copilot+ AI PC plan fizzled, but it still served a purpose","Microsoft&#39;s Copilot+ initiative launched last year with a clear goal: To produce capable laptops for people eagerly anticipating AI-powered features. Read that sentence again, and it&#39;s glaringly obvious that Microsoft&#39;s plan was flawed from the start. Most consumers aren&#39;t nearly as hyped for AI features as the companies eager to foist artificial intelligence upon us. And those features aren&#39;t exactly compelling, either. Microsoft&#39;s Recall — which snaps screenshots of your PC to create a database of everything you’ve done– was dogged by privacy concerns from the start. And to be honest, I haven&#39;t found its ability to remember the files and websites I&#39;ve opened to be that useful.Without any sort of killer AI app, most consumers weren&#39;t going to pay a premium for Copilot+ systems either. Not in this precarious economy, anyway. So it wasn&#39;t a huge surprise to see sales of Copilot+ systems going practically nowhere over the last year. In the third quarter of 2024, they accounted for less than 10 percent of systems shipped, according to data from Mercury Research (via Tom’s Hardware). The research firm IDC (via PCWorld) also found that Copilot+ systems made up just 2.3 percent of Windows machines sold in the first quarter of 2025 (and a mere 1.9 percent of the entire PC market).Instead of continuing to promote Copilot+, Microsoft now wants to &#34;make every Windows 11 computer an AI PC&#34;. The new &#34;Hey Copilot&#34; voice commands and Copilot Vision, a feature that lets the AI assistant see what&#39;s on your screen, are both cloud-powered. That means you won&#39;t need the beefy 40 TOPS neural processing units (NPU) found on Copilot+ systems to use them. Microsoft spent the past few years touting NPUs as the gateway to useful AI features, like Recall and Windows Studio webcam effects, but only one of its new AI capabilities actually requires an NPU. (And even that is just a slight update to Click to Do, allowing you to send Zoom invitations by right-clicking on e-mail addresses.)It&#39;s easy to view the whole Copilot+ initiative as a cynical way to ramp up AI hype and push people towards expensive new laptops, especially as the October 14 Windows 10 end of support date loomed. But it also led to some genuinely useful changes: Microsoft made 16GB of RAM a standard for Copilot+ systems, along with 256GB of storage and the aforementioned 40 TOPS NPUs. The launch of Copilot was also the kick in the pants Microsoft needed to revamp Windows for mobile Arm processors. I never thought I&#39;d love a Surface with a Snapdragon chip, but the improved Arm support on the Surface Pro and this year&#39;s smaller model finally won me over.The Dell 16 Premium sitting on a ledge.I wouldn’t call the Copilot+ program a huge swing, but it’s still the sort of industry-wide cat herding that’s rare to see in the PC space. Microsoft couldn’t just snap its fingers and shift all PCs to efficient mobile chips with powerful NPUs, like Apple did with its own jump to M-series chips years ago. Microsoft had to wait for new NPU-equipped hardware from Qualcomm (and eventually Intel and AMD). It had to finally fix the Windows on Arm problem. And it also had to double-down on AI features that felt truly transformative. It’s just a shame that consumers didn’t seem to care.Microsoft said that Copilot+ systems accounted for 15 percent of premium PCs sold during last year’s holiday season, but the company hasn’t released any new sales figures since then. “This is the fastest adoption I&#39;ve seen of a new category of hardware, and  we&#39;ve done it faster than the normal generational shift of silicon,” James Howell, Microsoft’s VP of Windows marketing, said in a conversation with Engadget. “Copilot+ PCs continue to be a transition that we are pushing for and prioritizing. But I can&#39;t give you the exact numbers beyond that… Just for the last two or three months, we&#39;ve been doing pretty well with year-on-year growth in the Windows business.”Surface Pro Copilot+Devindra Hardawar for EngadgetWhile Microsoft ultimately doesn’t have much to show for the Copilot+ initiative, the steady progression of hardware will lead to AI PCs dominating over the next five years. The research firm Omdia predicts that AI PCs will account for 55 percent of computers shipped in all of 2026, up from 42.5 percent of systems in Q3 2025. By 2029, Omdia predicts AI PCs will make up 75 percent of all systems shipped, giving Windows 80 percent of the AI PC market.  Omdia AI PC shipment predictionsOmdia“It’s important to note that this steep adoption curve [for AI PCs] is driven more by the product roadmaps of the PC market, rather than consumers and businesses seeking PCs specifically for AI,” according to Omdia research analyst Kieren Jessop. “For businesses, and consumers especially, AI-capable PC adoption is more a function of a customer going to purchase a device and that device just so happens to have an NPU.”Microsoft was basically right: AI PCs are the future. But it turns out the AI features people actually want to use — like ChatGPT, Sora and Microsoft’s own Copilot — are mostly powered by the cloud, making  onboard NPUs superfluous. That won’t be true forever. There are tangible security, speed and convenience benefits for onboard AI processing, like transcribing sensitive audio instead of sending it to the cloud. But for now, those AI workloads are relatively niche, and they’re not enough to make the Copilot+ a true success by any measure.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/microsofts-copilot-ai-pc-plan-fizzled-but-it-still-served-a-purpose-130000239.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2F9c1f1230-3310-11ef-bab7-bb286fa69975_%25281%2529.jpeg&resize=1400%2C854&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=77920b32d4ca609a5423f1a85fef8d0ebe1319ef,https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/microsofts-copilot-ai-pc-plan-fizzled-but-it-still-served-a-purpose-130000239.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-05T13:00:00Z,17,Tech

The Morning After: Flying Antigravity’s A1 drone is unlike anything else,"Spinning off from the action-camera company Insta360, Antigravity now has its debut drone on sale. With 360-degree cameras that capture 8K and offer you a truly unconstrained view of the skies, the A1 is a different drone from everything else out there. Sorry, DJI.
Instead of typical drone joysticks, you get a motion controller that lets you point and shoot like video game gesture controls, while crisp FPV goggles put you right inside the cockpit.
Engadget
It’s easy to fly after takeoff, but the A1’s myriad parts are often tricky to sync together — and pulling video down to the companion app is even trickier. Going on specs alone, like speed and camera sensor size, it doesn’t stand up to cinematic drones from the likes of DJI.
Still, it’s not meant to be a cinematic drone. It’s a hybrid mix of flight experience, FPV drone and a not-miss-a-thing camera drone. It’s truly unique — and fun.

Amazon halts its incredibly poor AI anime dubbing ‘beta’
Ridiculed by all.

Amazon has quietly removed its terrible AI-generated English dubs for several anime shows on Prime Video, following widespread ridicule from viewers and the industry. AI dubs were recently added to Banana Fish, No Game, No Life and Vinland Saga, where they were labeled “AI beta” in the Languages section of the app.
For shows lacking an English-language dub, it was a seemingly cheap way to consume anime for Amazon. However, it quickly became clear that the dubs were really quite bad. Baaaad.
Voice actor Daman Mills called the AI-generated dub for Banana Fish a “massive insult to us as performers” in a post on X.

Amazon thinks about ending ties with the US Postal Service
The company continues to invest heavily in its own shipping network.

An Amazon double today. According to The Washington Post, Amazon is considering discontinuing use of the US Postal Service and building its own shipping network to rival it. The e-commerce behemoth spends more than $6 billion a year on the public mail carrier — almost 8 percent of the service’s total revenue. That’s up from just under $4 billion in 2019. That split might be due to a breakdown in negotiations between Amazon and the USPS rather than Amazon proactively pulling its business.
Amazon has invested heavily in all kinds of delivery methods, including shipping logistics, buying its own Boeing planes, launching its own electric delivery vans and slowly building a drone delivery network.

Nikon ZR camera review
A highly capable cinema camera at a reasonable price.

The Nikon ZR could be a breakthrough for content creators, largely because it incorporates technology from RED — a company now owned by Nikon. The combination of professional-grade video quality (specifically RED RAW) and autofocus comes at a fraction of the cost of dedicated cinema rigs. There are some compromises on battery life and the lack of a viewfinder, but the ZR arguably offers the best video quality for the money.

The Consumer Technology Association has already published a searchable directory of who will have a presence at the show, along with a schedule of every official panel and presentation.On Sunday, January 4, Samsung will kick-off CES with &#34;The First Look,&#34; a presentation hosted by TM Roh, the CEO of Samsung&#39;s DX Division, on the company&#39;s &#34;vision for the DX (Device eXperience) Division in 2026, along with new AI-driven customer experiences.&#34; That&#39;ll be followed by multiple press conferences throughout Monday, January 5. LG is hosting its &#34;Innovation in Tune with You&#34; presentation to share &#34;its vision for elevating daily life through Affectionate Intelligence&#34; at the start of the day, Intel is launching its new Core Ultra Series 3 processors in the afternoon, Sony Honda Mobility is holding a press conference on its first car and AMD CEO Lisa Su will cover AMD&#39;s upcoming chip announcements at a keynote address that closes out the day.Finally, on Tuesday, January 6, Lenovo CEO Yuanqing Yang will host Lenovo&#39;s Tech World Conference at Sphere, using the large and decidedly curved screen to share the company&#39;s &#34;commitment to delivering smarter AI for all by constantly redefining how technology can engage, inspire, and empower.&#34;Outside of the formal introduction of new products and initiatives, reading the tea leaves of what was announced last year and what companies are reportedly working on, we can make some educated guesses at what we could see at CES 2026.New chips from AMD, Intel and QualcommCES is frequently the start of a cascade of new chip announcements for a given year, and one of the first places new silicon appears in real consumer products. AMD will likely use its keynote to introduce new versions of its Ryzen chips, including the recently spotted Ryzen 7 9850X3D, which is expected to offer better single-threaded performance, and the Ryzen 9000G series, which could be built with AMD&#39;s Zen 5 architecture. The company might also use its CES stage to go over its new FSR Redstone AI upscaling tech.Intel has already publicly announced that it&#39;ll launch its Panther Lake chips at CES 2026. The officially titled Intel Core Ultra Series 3 chips fit into Intel&#39;s overall &#34;AI PC&#34; push, but are specifically meant for premium laptops. Based on a preview from October 2025, Intel says the first chip made with its 2-nanometer 18A process will offer 50 percent more processing performance than previous generations and for the chip&#39;s Arc GPU, a 50 percent performance bump from last generation.Qualcomm is also rumored to be targeting laptops at the show, building on the work it&#39;s done moving its Snapdragon chips out of phones and tablets and into other types of computers. The company&#39;s Snapdragon X2 Elite and X2 Elite Premium chips should start appearing in laptops at CES 2026, offering a look at the improved speed and AI performance the company promised in 2025.Brighter, &#34;truer&#34; screensSony announced a collection of new Bravia TVs in April 2025, replacing the company&#39;s flagship, filling in its midrange options and adding a new budget model to the mix. The star of this updated Bravia lineup is the Bravia 9, which features a QD-OLED panel, but Sony appears to be prepping entirely new display tech for 2026. In March 2025, Sony introduced a new RGB LED panel that uses individual Mini LED backlights colored in red, green and blue to produce even brighter, more accurate colors. In contrast to a QD-OLED, which filters a layer of blue organic light emitting diodes through quantum dots that change color, Sony&#39;s &#34;General RGB LED Backlight Technology&#34; can get as bright as a Mini LED panel without needing an extra filter layer or worrying about OLED&#39;s problems with burn-in. The company has already trademarked the name &#34;True RGB,&#34; which could end up being what Sony calls this new flavor of display if it decides to show them off at CES. It seems entirely likely, because CES is nothing if not a TV show — it’s a sure bet that we’ll see new TVs from the likes of LG and Samsung in addition to Sony. If the company doesn&#39;t introduce new display tech for its TVs, it does have a new 240Hz PlayStation monitor coming in 2026 that it could show off at CES instead.Sony isn&#39;t the only company hyped on bright screens. Samsung is reportedly pushing an updated version of the HDR10 and HDR10+ standards that could be ready to demo at CES 2026. The new HDR10+ Advanced standard would be Samsung&#39;s answer to Dolby Vision 2, which includes support for things bi-directional tone mapping and intelligent features that automatically adapt sports and gaming content. Samsung&#39;s take will reportedly offer improved brightness, genre-based tone mapping and intelligent motion smoothing options, among other improvements.Ballie Watch 2026The ball-shaped yellow robot lovingly known as &#34;Ballie&#34; has been announced twice, first in 2020 and then again in 2024 with a projector in tow. Samsung said Ballie would go on sale in 2025 at CES last year and then shared in April 2025 that Ballie would ship this summer with Google&#39;s Gemini onboard. But it&#39;s nearly 2026, and Ballie is nowhere to be seen. It&#39;s possible Samsung could make a third attempt at announcing its robot at CES 2026, but whether or not it does, robotics will still be a big part of the show.Robot vacuums and mops were a major highlight of CES 2025, and it&#39;s safe to expect notable improvements from the new models that are announced at CES 2026. Not every company will adopt the retractable arm of the Roborock Saros Z70, but robot vacuums with legs for rising over small ledges like the Dreame X50 seem like they could become the norm. Roborock could also show off its new Roborock Qrevo Curv 2 Flow, the first of its robot vacuums to feature a retractable roller mop.Beyond just traversing spaces more efficiently, improving robots&#39; navigation could also be a major concern at the show. Prominent members of the AI industry are turning their attention from large language models to world models, which aim to give AI a deep understanding of physical space. Those world models could be the key to making robots, bipedal or otherwise, competent at navigating homes and workplaces, and will likely be a significant talking point at CES 2026.We’ll be updating this article throughout the month as more rumors surface and new products are confirmed — stay tuned for future updates!This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/what-to-expect-at-ces-2026-120000278.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2F2025-12%2Fe8dccbc3-be88-4b87-a625-47af0b588c1a&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=847468bf6a6f5a8a4b43b937b35806bdd0094027,https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/what-to-expect-at-ces-2026-120000278.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-05T12:00:00Z,22,Tech

Critical React2Shell flaw actively exploited in China-linked attacks,Multiple China-linked threat actors began exploiting the React2Shell vulnerability (CVE-2025-55182) affecting React and Next.js just hours after the max-severity issue was disclosed. [...],,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/react2shell-critical-flaw-actively-exploited-in-china-linked-attacks/,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/feed/,2025-12-05T11:26:07Z,12,Cybersecurity
Cloudflare firewall reacts badly to React exploit mitigation,"
		
					  
						




Cloudflare’s network suffered a brief but widespread outage Friday, after an update to its Web Application Firewall to mitigate a vulnerability in React Server Components went wrong.



At 9:09 a.m. UTC, the company reported that it was investigating issues with the Cloudflare Dashboard and related APIs, warning that customers might see requests fail or errors displayed.



Just 10 minutes later, it had deployed a fix — but not before a flood of reports of problems with Cloudflare and its customers poured into uptime tracking sites such as Downdetector.com.



During the same window, Downdetector saw a spike in problem reports for enterprise services including Shopify, Zoom, Claude AI, and Amazon Web Services, and a host of consumer services from games to dating apps.



Cloudflare explained the outage on its service status page: “A change made to how Cloudflare’s Web Application Firewall parses requests caused Cloudflare’s network to be unavailable for several minutes this morning. This was not an attack; the change was deployed by our team to help mitigate the industry-wide vulnerability disclosed this week in React Server Components.”



That vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-55182, enables attackers to remotely execute code on web servers running the React 19 library. Cloudflare was no doubt attempting to protect those of its customers who have not yet had an opportunity to patch the vulnerability in the two days since it was revealed.



The wobble in Cloudflare’s services comes just two weeks after a much bigger one rendering its customers’ websites inaccessible or unreliable for hours on Nov. 18. That was caused by one Cloudflare application generating a configuration file that was too big for another application to parse, bringing systems to a halt.



This outsized impact of that small failure on websites around the world was reminiscent of a bug that hit AWS services the previous month. A coding error in its DNS systems led to a DynamoDB endpoint becoming inaccessible. That wouldn’t have been so bad, but many other services used by AWS internally and by its customers relied on it, so they too were affected.



There are some advantages in relying on single service providers such as Cloudflare or AWS for these tasks — including economies of scale and service consistency. But it also makes them single points of failure: when they go down, everything goes down with them. In such a monoculture, the alternatives that might be able to take up the slack have already been weeded out.

The best laptops for gaming and schoolwork in 2025,"Balancing schoolwork with gaming usually means finding a laptop that can do a little bit of everything. The best gaming laptops aren’t just built for high frame rates. They also need to handle long days of writing papers, running productivity apps and streaming lectures without slowing down. A good machine should feel reliable during class and powerful enough to jump into your favorite games once homework is out of the way.There’s a wide range of options depending on how much performance you need. Some students prefer a slim, lightweight model that’s easy to carry to school, while others want a new gaming laptop with enough GPU power to handle AAA titles. If you’re watching your budget, there are plenty of solid choices that qualify as a budget gaming laptop without cutting too many corners.It’s also worth looking at features that help with everyday use. A bright display makes long study sessions easier on the eyes, and a comfortable keyboard is essential if you type a lot. USB-C ports, decent battery life and a responsive trackpad can make a big difference during the school day. We’ve rounded up the best laptops that strike the right mix of performance, portability and value for both gaming and schoolwork.

Best laptop for gaming and schoolwork FAQs 
Are gaming laptops good for school? 
As we’ve mentioned, gaming laptops are especially helpful if you&#39;re doing any demanding work. Their big promise is powerful graphics performance, which isn&#39;t just limited to PC gaming. Video editing and 3D rendering programs can also tap into their GPUs to handle laborious tasks. While you can find decent GPUs on some productivity machines, like Dell&#39;s XPS 15, you can sometimes find better deals on gaming laptops. My general advice for any new workhorse: Pay attention to the specs; get at least 16GB of RAM and the largest solid state drive you can find (ideally 1TB or more). Those components are both typically hard to upgrade down the line, so it’s worth investing what you can up front to get the most out of your PC gaming experience long term. Also, don’t forget the basics like a webcam, which will likely be necessary for the schoolwork portion of your activities. 
The one big downside to choosing a gaming notebook is portability. For the most part, we&#39;d recommend 15-inch models to get the best balance of size and price. Those typically weigh in around 4.5 pounds, which is significantly more than a three-pound ultraportable. Today&#39;s gaming notebooks are still far lighter than older models, though, so at least you won&#39;t be lugging around a 10-pound brick. If you’re looking for something lighter, there are plenty of 14-inch options these days. And if you&#39;re not into LED lights and other gamer-centric bling, keep an eye out for more understated models that still feature essentials like a webcam (or make sure you know how to turn those lights off). 
Do gaming laptops last longer than standard laptops? 
Not necessarily — it really depends on how you define &#34;last longer.&#34; In terms of raw performance, gaming laptops tend to pack more powerful components than standard laptops, which means they can stay relevant for longer when it comes to handling demanding software or modern games. That makes them a solid choice if you need a system that won’t feel outdated in a couple of years, especially for students or creators who also game in their downtime. 
But there’s a trade-off. All that power generates heat, and gaming laptops often run hotter and put more strain on internal components than typical ultraportables. If they’re not properly cooled or regularly maintained (think dust buildup and thermal paste), that wear and tear can shorten their lifespan. They’re also usually bulkier and have shorter battery life, which can impact long-term usability depending on your daily needs. 
Gaming laptops can last longer performance-wise, but only if you take good care of them. If your needs are light — browsing, writing papers and streaming — a standard laptop may actually last longer simply because it’s under less stress day-to-day. 
What is the role of GPU in a computer for gaming and school? 
The GPU plays a big role in how your laptop handles visuals — and it’s especially important if you’re using your computer for both gaming and school. 
For gaming, the GPU is essential. It’s responsible for rendering graphics, textures, lighting and all the visual effects that make your favorite titles look smooth and realistic. A more powerful GPU means better frame rates, higher resolutions and the ability to play modern games without lag or stuttering. 
For schoolwork, the GPU matters too — but its importance depends on what you&#39;re doing. If your school tasks mostly involve writing papers, browsing the web or using productivity tools like Google Docs or Microsoft Office, you don’t need a high-end GPU. But if you’re working with graphic design, video editing, 3D modeling or anything else that’s visually demanding, a good GPU can speed things up significantly and improve your workflow.

Netflix is reportedly in exclusive talks to acquire Warner Bros. and HBO,"Netflix is in exclusive talks to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery&#39;s film and TV studios and HBO Max streaming service, according to sources from Bloomberg. That suggests Netflix submitted a superior offer to rivals including Paramount Skydance Corp (owned by billionaire Larry Ellison) and Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal. The deal could be consummated within days and, if approved, would change the landscape of Hollywood and the streaming market. 
Warner Bros. Discovery&#39;s cable channels including CNN, TBS and TNT, valued at more than $60 billion, would not be part of the deal and spun off prior to the closing. However, Netflix would become the owner of the HBO network and its library of series (The Sopranos, Game of Thrones, etc.), along with its Burbank studios and massive film and TV archive consisting of 12,500 feature films and 2,400 TV series, including properties like Batman, Lord of the Rings and Friends. 
A big sweetener offered by Netflix was a $5 billion breakup fee if the deal isn&#39;t approved by regulators, according to people familiar with the discussions. That&#39;s a considerable risk on Netflix&#39;s part, as the acquisition is likely to be closely scrutinized by the FCC and even President Trump himself, who reportedly has close ties to Ellison. It would also need to pass muster with regulators from other nations, considering the wide reach of WBD and Netflix. 
After multiple suitors, including Paramount Skydance expressed interest in buying Warner Bros. Discovery, CEO David Zaslav put the company up for sale in October. The bidding process has been heated, with Paramount&#39;s lawyers complaining that WBD &#34;embarked on a myopic process with a predetermined outcome that favors a single bidder,&#34; namely Netflix. Paramount argued that its deal would be more palatable to regulators around the world.
However, Zaslav&#39;s camp has said that it would achieve the best value in a sale by splitting off its cable assets and doing two separate deals, CNN reported. Both Paramount Skydance and Comcast submitted deals to buy all of WBD&#39;s assets. 
Netflix offered around $28 a share for WBD minus the cable assets, according to Deadline. Shares were as low as $7.50 earlier this year. The acquisition would be far and away the largest for Netflix, which has historically favored organic growth. 
An acquisition could have a huge impact on streaming customers and filmgoers. Would Netflix merge its catalog with HBO Max or continue to run the latter as a separate service? It&#39;s also not clear if Netflix would honor Warner Bros.&#39; commitment to theatrical releases, considering that Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos has called movie theatres an &#34;outdated concept.&#34;This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/netflix-is-reportedly-in-exclusive-talks-to-acquire-warner-bros-and-hbo-082233278.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-11%2F5a8e0ca0-c6e3-11f0-9d2f-3f4f2dbf1c1d&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=3ceb1652c846c2662a8e45d2904ae51f342e7509,https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/netflix-is-reportedly-in-exclusive-talks-to-acquire-warner-bros-and-hbo-082233278.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-05T08:22:33Z,10,Tech

"15 years in, zero trust remains elusive — with AI rising to complicate the challenge","
		
					  
						




The zero trust approach cybersecurity access control is more than 15 years old but organizations continue to struggle with its implementation due in large part to fragmented tooling and legacy infrastructure.



A recent report from Accenture paints a picture of widespread industry struggles in rolling out zero trust technologies, a perspective in line with the experiences of experts and security practitioners quizzed on the topic by CSO.



Zero trust networking involves applying a security framework where no user or device is trusted by default. Under zero trust, every access attempt is accompanied by authenticating identity and device compliance regardless of whether or not it originates within an organization.



The approach contrasts with traditional “castle and moat” models where devices within an enterprise network were trusted by default.



Many enterprises have progressed slowly on their zero trust journeys largely because implementation requires a fundamental shift in both mindset and infrastructure. Key roadblocks include:




Legacy systems that weren’t designed for zero trust principles,



Fragmented identity and access tools that make unified enforcement difficult, and



Cultural and organizational resistance to changing long-standing trust models.




Kyle Wickert, field CTO at AlgoSec, says zero trust remains one of the most misunderstood transformations in cybersecurity.



“Many organizations still hesitate to pursue it because they associate zero trust with rigid architectures, operational complexity, and high implementation costs,” Wickert says. “That perception is rooted in the legacy days of reassigning IPs, redesigning routing, re-plumbing VLANs, or physically rewiring environments just to enforce segmentation policies.”



The industry-wide shift to software-defined and cloud-driven data centers has lifted legacy challenges while creating new issues in the shape of growing policy and application complexity.



“One of the biggest obstacles to zero trust at scale is no longer the infrastructure — it’s the challenge of defining, governing, and maintaining policies that adapt across hybrid networks, spanning on-prem firewalls, cloud-native controls, SDN, SD-WAN, and SASE technologies,” Wickert says. “The most effective way to overcome these challenges is to shift the focus of segmentation from ‘devices and subnets’ to applications and their connectivity.”



Richard Holland, field CISO at threat-led cybersecurity firm Quorum Cyber, argues that zero trust represents a method to mature an organization’s security health rather than a set of products and services.



“I would argue that the technology to achieve zero trust has been in existence for some time and CISOs and CIOs may have already found themselves on a roadmap without realizing it is zero trust,” Holland says. “By treating zero trust as a journey to improve cybersecurity health, and by taking small bite-size chunks, you can iterate through a series of improvements in relatively quick succession.”



Other cybersecurity experts contend that zero trust migrations offer an opportunity to support more ambitious IT transformation projects.



Stephen Fridakis, CISO in residence at Cyderes, says the shift from network-based rules to identity-based rules inherent in zero trust implementations offers a roadmap to “safer, simpler, and more durable” enterprise architectures.



“IP ranges, VLANs, and physical locations are brittle and age badly, especially with M&amp;A churn and cloud adoption,” Fridakis explains. “Identity-based access follows the user and device, not the network.”



He adds: “It eliminates firewall sprawl, reduces engineering overhead, and enforces intent instead of infrastructure.”



Wise up



University of Texas CISO George Finney has discussed zero trust with hundreds of security leaders. Those conversations have uncovered several common denominators on why zero trust projects fail.



Firstly, internal politics has the potential to derail zero trust implementations. “Technology in a company is generally operated and supported in silos,” Finney says. “These different areas may not understand the big picture of how much risk a cybersecurity breach could represent and resist change.”



Conversely, in organizations that have successfully shifted to zero trust, “leadership in every area agree that security is a core part of the success of the organization as a whole,” Finney says.



Insufficient education can also act as a barrier preventing the successful rollout of zero trust technologies, according to Finney.



“Starting a zero trust project requires more than just changing the design of a network or modifying some settings in an application,” he says. “Everyone on the team needs to understand what zero trust is, why the organization is doing it, and what role they’ll play in supporting it.”



“This means that every zero trust project needs to begin with education to help change not just the technology, but the culture of the organization as well,” he adds.



Gary Brickhouse, CISO at GuidePoint Security, notes that an “overly-complex approach” to zero trust has driven up costs and timelines as organizations pursue overly strict alignment with zero trust principles.



“Most organizations would benefit from a simplified risk-based approach, identifying critical use cases that are achievable and deliver the desired outcome of risk reduction,” Brickhouse says. “Early wins improving the security of the organization and moving the ZT [zero trust] needle forward builds confidence across the organization.”



Rob Forbes, CISO at Stratascale, advises security leaders to develop a strategic roadmap before embarking on any zero trust project.



“[CISOs should] start with a comprehensive assessment of their current security posture and assets,” Forbes counsels. “Next, develop a roadmap for zero trust implementation, prioritizing critical assets and high-risk areas.”



These steps should be followed by investments in training and tools to support the transition to a zero trust model, which ought to be left open to further refinement as requirement evolve.



“[Companies should] regularly review and update their zero trust strategy to adapt to new threats and technologies,” Forbes adds.



AI ‘reinforces’ zero trust paradigm



As agentic AI becomes increasingly embedded in the business, standard zero trust principles must be extended to keep the enterprise secure.



By 2027, growth of AI agents will push 50% of CIOs to restructure and automate identity and data access and authorization management to reduce misuse and leakage as part of a zero trust architecture, according to industry analyst firm IDC.



Security experts call on organizations to implement a new wave of zero trust, extending beyond people and devices to include AI agents. In practice, this means enforcing strict context boundaries, trusted domain controls, and AI-specific security reviews.



John Kindervag, chief evangelist officer at Illumio, tells CSO that “AI doesn’t change the zero trust paradigm — it reinforces it.”



“AI operates within the constraints of cybersecurity’s foundational rules, and attacks only work if there’s an open door,” Kindervag argues.



The bigger risk is from AI models, according to Kindervag.



“AI models can become a liability if not governed by zero trust,” he says. “If an organization doesn’t treat its AI models as protect surfaces, they risk manipulation, poisoning, or theft.”



In most cases, AI supports zero trust implementation.



“Good AI highlights high-risk communication patterns, surfaces unusual behaviour, and accelerates processes like labeling and policy implementation,” Kindervag explains. “AI can help in every step of the zero trust five-step methodology, but it really helps organizations to push beyond resilience into anti-fragility.”

SpyCloud Data Shows Corporate Users 3x More Likely to Be Targeted by Phishing Than by Malware,"
		
					  
						




Phishing has surged 400% year-over-year, highlighting need for real-time visibility into identity exposures.



SpyCloud, the leader in identity threat protection, today released new data showing a sharp rise in phishing attacks that disproportionately target corporate users. The company tracked a 400% year-over-year increase in successfully phished identities, with nearly 40% of the 28+ million recaptured phished records containing a business email address – compared to just 11.5% in recaptured malware data. The result is a warning to enterprises that their workforce is three times more likely to be targeted with phishing attacks than infostealer malware. 



The findings reinforce a growing shift in cybercriminals’ strategy: phishing is now the preferred gateway into enterprise environments, and SpyCloud sees this trend continuing in 2026. Threat actors are using this access as a launchpad for follow-on attacks, with SpyCloud reporting in its 2025 Identity Threat Report that phishing is now the leading entry point for ransomware, accounting for 35% of all ransomware infections. 



“Phishing is now one of the most scalable tools cybercriminals use to breach enterprise environments,” said Trevor Hilligoss, SpyCloud’s Head of Security Research. “Cybercrime enablement services, like phishing-as-a-service kits that automate convincing lures and adversary-in-the-middle tactics that capture MFA tokens and session cookies, put advanced tactics into the hands of low-skilled actors, making it easier than ever to compromise users at scale. SpyCloud’s visibility into these campaigns gives organizations a critical edge, helping them detect who’s been targeted and what data has been exposed, and remediate those credentials before they can be weaponized.”



SpyCloud is the only provider recapturing and automatically remediating successfully phished identity data and targeting lists at scale before follow-on attacks like ransomware, fraud, and account takeover can occur.



“Many organizations rely on traditional defenses like email filtering, endpoint protection, and employee education to stop phishing and malware attempts, but those tools only go so far,” said Damon Fleury, SpyCloud’s Chief Product Officer. “Attackers are still getting through – and when they do, it’s the exposed identity data that enables further harm. Security teams need to be vigilant about what’s already been compromised and circulating in the criminal underground. Prevention is important, but without real-time visibility and post-compromise remediation, it’s not enough.”



While phishing has become a dominant entry point, malware remains a critical threat vector. In the age of remote work and bring-your-own-device policies, personal exposures are increasingly used to compromise enterprise environments. A recent example is the 2025 Nikkei breach, where malware on a personal device led to the compromise of sensitive corporate data. Despite only 11.5% of recaptured malware infections exfiltrating business email addresses directly, SpyCloud data shows that nearly 1 in 2 corporate users have been the victim of an infostealer malware infection in their digital history, whether that be on a managed or unmanaged device – a strong indicator that threat actors are moving laterally from personal to corporate accounts.



“Protecting the enterprise means looking beyond corporate accounts,” Fleury added. “Due to the continuous reuse of passwords and shared identity data across work and personal accounts like mobile numbers, the line between a user’s personal digital history and their professional access effectively no longer exists. That’s why it’s essential to monitor and remediate exposures across the full spectrum of an individual’s digital identity – personal and professional.”

Coupang breach of 33.7 million accounts allegedly involved engineer insider,"
		
					  
						




A prolonged lack of management of valid authentication keys for signed access tokens issued to authenticators is believed to be the root cause of over 30 million accounts being exposed externally by ecommerce giant Coupang. Ongoing analysis suggests that these keys could have been exploited even after the responsible employee left the company.



On Nov. 29, Coupang released a statement confirming the unauthorized exposure of personal information from approximately 4,500 accounts on Nov. 18. The company also noted that the breach had been reported to the National Police Agency, the Korea Internet &amp; Security Agency, and the Personal Information Protection Commission. Subsequent investigations, however, revealed that the damage involved approximately 33.7 million accounts.



Leaked information included names, email addresses, shipping address lists, and some order information. Coupang stated that payment information, credit card numbers, and login information were not included. It is believed that unauthorized access occurred via overseas servers starting on June 24, 2025. The company also stated that it is currently cooperating with relevant authorities to investigate the cause of the breach.



The Ministry of Science and ICT, the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, and other relevant agencies conducted an on-site investigation after receiving a report of a breach on Nov. 19 and a report of a personal information leak on Nov. 20. The investigation confirmed that the attacker exploited an authentication vulnerability in Coupang’s servers, bypassing the normal login process and leaking customer information.



The government launched a joint public-private investigation team on Nov. 30, and the Personal Information Protection Commission is investigating whether Coupang violated its personal information protection safety measures — access control, access authority management, encryption, etc. As a service with such a high user base that it’s often called the “Amazon of Korea,” Coupang issued a public security notice on Nov. 29 to prevent secondary damage. Furthermore, a three-month period, starting Nov. 30, will be dedicated to strengthening the monitoring of personal information leaks and illegal distribution online.



Meanwhile, Choi Min-hee, Chairwoman of the National Assembly Science, ICT, Broadcasting and Communications Committee, released the results of an analysis of the specific causes of the incident in a press release on Nov. 30. According to information received from Coupang, the company reportedly responded that “the token signing key validity period is often set to 5 to 10 years,” adding that “the rotation period is long and varies greatly depending on the key type.”



Chairman Choi’s side explained this incident using an analogy to an access control system. If the “token” required for login is a single-use access card, the “signature key” is like the authentication stamp used to issue the access card. While access is impossible without the authentication stamp, even with the access card, if the signature key is left unattended for an extended period, it can be subject to continued exploitation.



According to Rep. Choi Min-hee’s office, Coupang’s login system is designed to immediately discard tokens after they are created, but the signature information required for token creation was deleted or not updated when the employee in charge left the company, and was thus exploited by internal employees.



In a press release, Chairman Choi Min-hee stated, “Coupang did not follow the most basic internal security procedure of renewing the signing key,” and “Abandoning a long-term valid authentication key was not simply a deviation by an internal employee, but the result of organizational and structural problems at Coupang that neglected the authentication system.”



Victims of this breach have been notified via email or text message. Related information can also be found on a separate information page.



Coupang CEO Park Dae-joon issued a separate statement on Nov. 30, saying, “We sincerely apologize for causing great inconvenience and concern to the public,” and “Coupang will do its best to prevent further damage by closely cooperating with the joint public-private investigation team including the Ministry of Science and ICT, the Personal Information Protection Commission, the Korea Internet &amp; Security Agency, and the National Police Agency.”



South Korean President Lee Jae Myung this week referenced the data breach at Coupang in calling for increased penalties for corporate negligence in such scenarios. The breach is believed to be the worst in South Korea in over a decade. Bloomberg reports that the breach may be a landmark case for South Korea. It could result in a record fine, potentially up to 1.2 trillion won (US$814M).



The prime suspect is a former Coupang engineer who had worked on authentication systems. The police are investigating whether the former employee acted alone or collaborated with others on the breach.

"Suspicious traffic could be testing CDN evasion, says expert","
		
					  
						




An individual or group is doing new probing of content delivery networks (CDNs), an effort that CSOs, CIOs and network administrators should worry about if they use CDNs instead of web application firewalls to protect websites.



That’s the conclusion of Johannes Ullrich, dean of research at the SANS Institute, who this week said  his organization’s honeypots last month detected a curious amount of traffic with server requests that include CDN-related headers.



Perhaps, he said, someone is testing a tactic to evade CDN defences for launching either a targeted attack or a widespread distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack on a site.



For example, the honeypots have seen headers on traffic that include:




“Cf-Warp-Tag-Id,” which is associated with Cloudflare’s Warp VPN service;



“X-Fastly-Request-Id,”, which is associated with the Fastly CDN;



“X-Akamai-Transformed,” a header added by Akamai;



and a puzzler: “X-T0Ken-Inf0.” Ullrich thinks it might contain a form of authentication token, but isn’t sure.




In an interview, he said one explanation is that a threat actor is trying to get around a CDN’s filters by creating page requests that include a CDN-related header.



Another possible explanation is that these requests are merely going through a CDN, but, Ullrich said, “the requests we’re seeing don’t quite look like that.”



Internet requests are messages sent from a client such as a web browser to a web server, requesting a web page. A wave of requests can be a DDoS attack, or mask a different kind of attack.



These days, many organizations use CDNs or cloud providers for basic DDoS protection and bot filtering in addition to load balancing. In a typical setup, Ullrich said, DNS is used to point clients to the CDN, which then forwards the request to a customer’s web server.



However, there’s a problem: If an attacker can identify the IP address of the actual web server, they are often able to bypass the CDN and reach the web server directly. There are a few ways for users to prevent this. For example, depending on the CDN selected, it may be possible to allow access only from the CDN’s IP address space. However, for some of the larger providers, this list of addresses may be large and very dynamic. 



Another option is to add custom headers. Some CDNs offer special custom headers with randomized values to identify requests that have passed through the CDN. And a less secure option is to look for any header that identifies the CDN. However, Ullrich noted, merely looking for a header should be avoided, as attackers can easily include this header in their traffic. This appears to be the activity the SANS honeypot has been seeing since November.



A spokesperson for CDN Cloudflare’s PR agency said a comment couldn’t be arranged by deadline.

Kellman Meghu, chief security architect at DeepCove Security, says the activity seen by the SANS Institute’s honeypots isn’t new. But, he added, it only becomes an issue when there is improper access control, or the controls fail.



“Origin web servers should be deployed with access controls, be it security groups or firewall rules, to only ever allow communication with the CDN service,” he said in an email. “Just deploying your web application as accessible to the world, and then overlaying a CDN to act as the front end seems like a terrible waste of money and effort. In today’s world of infrastructure-as-code, this can and should be easy to manage and mitigate as far as risk goes.”



Aditya Sood, VP of security engineering and AI strategy at Aryaka, said in an email that a surge in requests that include CDN-related headers “is clear experimentation from threat actors, and the impersonation isn’t just random noise, its reconnaissance. Attacks are probing to uncover the weak origin validation in organizations who are trusting the mere presence of a CDN-specific header instead of enforcing proper controls like IP allowlists, private network peering, or cryptographically validated tokens. When you see multiple CDN fingerprints being spoofed at roughly the same time, it usually means new tooling or automated scanners are being deployed in the wild.” 



Proper origin hardening that includes strict IP allowlists, validated tokens, or private connectivity is essential to protect websites, he said. “Relying only on the presence of CDN-specific headers is no longer viable, and organizations that have not fully locked down their backend infrastructure may already be exposed.”



Ullrich added that CDNs and other traffic filtering services will issue a unique value to each customer as proof that traffic has gone through its service, so web administrators should configure their web servers or next generation firewalls to only accept requests with that unique value.



The activity SANS has seen is “definitely something that should be seen as a warning that something that could become more than it is now,” he said. “Now it’s only a curiosity, but it could easily become more. You [admins] need to follow your content delivery network’s guidance to protect your web server from attacks like this.”

iam8bit is suing Skybound Game Studios alleging fraud and theft of designs,"Skybound Game Studios is being sued by indie outfit iam8bit over fraud and breach of contract, including the theft of original designs. Skybound Entertainment, the parent company of Skybound Game Studios, is chaired by Robert Kirkman, who may be best known for creating the original comic book of The Walking Dead. We&#39;ve reached out to Skybound for comment on the lawsuit but have not received a response as of publication.iam8bit is a video game producer as well as a merchandise operation selling vinyl soundtracks and other geek gear. The company entered into a partnership with Skybound Game Studios in April 2021. Since then, iam8bit alleges that Skybound conducted a multi-year accounting scheme and failed to provide accurate financial reports for the partnership each month. &#34;Skybound failed to provide the monthly reports as agreed,&#34; the Los Angeles Superior Court complaint reads. &#34;It also padded its expenses with millions of dollars in fake line items.&#34; iam8bit claims Skybound has yet to explain the line items, even to a third-party auditor that it engaged. The company is alleging more than $4 million in damages related to the accounting issues. iam8bit also accused Skybound of cutting it out of a deal regarding indie video game Stray. According to the company&#39;s counsel, iam8bit designed and developed promotional materials for the launch of Stray on PlayStation and Xbox consoles. The complaint claims that Skybound used trade secrets from iam8bit to secure its own deal for the Nintendo launch of the game. It alleges Skybound used confidential information about iam8bit’s royalty split with publishing Annapurna Interactive to cut out its business partner, while also using “almost exact copies” of its creative output for marketing.The full list of allegations in iam8bit&#39;s complaint include breach of contract, fraud, conversion, unjust enrichment and misappropriation.

"AI creates new security risks for OT networks, warns NSA","
		
					  
						




The security of operational technology (OT) in critical infrastructure has been a recurring theme for years, but this week the US National Security Agency (NSA) and its global partners added a new concern to the mix: how the increasing use of AI in OT risks making things worse.



The scope of these concerns, and guidance for addressing them, is outlined in the Principles for the Secure Integration of Artificial Intelligence in Operational Technology, authored by the NSA in conjunction with the Australian Signals Directorate’s Australian Cyber Security Centre (ASD’s ACSC) and a global alliance of national security agencies.



While the use of AI in critical infrastructure OT is in its early days, the guidance reads like an attempt by the NSA and its partners to get ahead of the problem before misuse or misapplication becomes entrenched. Although drafted for OT admins, the guidelines mirror concerns that also apply to IT administration.



Currently, AI is being put to work in OT networks in the energy, water treatment, healthcare, and manufacturing sectors for the same reason it is being used elsewhere: to optimize and automate processes, thereby improving efficiency and uptime.



The worry is that organizations are jumping into a new and far from battle-hardened technology without assessing its limitations, echoing what has been happening in IT. Measuring risk against the industrial control systems (ICS) Purdue Model hierarchy, the guidelines enumerate worries such as adversarial prompt injection and data poisoning, data collection leading to reduced safety, and “AI drift” in which models become less accurate as new data diverges from training data.



Also mentioned: AI can lack the explainability necessary to diagnose errors, there are difficulties meeting compliance requirements as AI rapidly evolves, and there’s a human de-skilling effect caused by a creeping over-dependence on AI. Likewise, AI alerts might lead to distraction and cognitive overload among employees.



Finally, the tendency of AI technologies such as chatbots and LLMs to hallucinate raises doubts about whether the technology is robust enough to be used in environments where safety is a priority. “AI may not be reliable enough to independently make critical decisions in industrial environments. As such, AI such as LLMs almost certainly should not be used to make safety decisions for OT environments,” said the authors.



This underlines an important difference between using AI in an OT setting and an IT one – OT networks are by nature safety-critical. Although many of the issues are the same, the margin for error is much smaller.



Struggling to unwind



“The guidance raises the right questions: what risks are we introducing, what value does AI truly bring, who is accountable for oversight, and how do we respond when the technology misbehaves?” commented Sam Maesschalck, an OT engineer with cyber security training platform Immersive Labs. “We’ve already seen what happens when operational demands outpace secure design. IT/OT convergence brought efficiency, but it also exposed OT networks in ways the industry is still struggling to unwind.”



According to Maesschalck, grafting AI systems onto OT infrastructure would fail if pre-existing issues aren’t addressed first. These include the inability of some OT devices to feed the required volumes of data to AI platforms, and a lack of asset inventories that make problem interactions more difficult to predict.



Among the guidelines’ recommendations are for organizations to adopt CISA’s secure design principles, and to assess whether developing an AI-OT project inhouse would give organizations more control over AI design and implementation in the long run.



“This kind of guidance is influential because operators are looking for clarity. Having government-backed principles to reference gives owners and engineers something concrete to point to when they push back on unsafe or rushed adoption. It also reinforces how essential education is,” said Maesschalck.



The guidelines arrive on the heels of last year’s NSA and ACSC report listing the steps organizations should take to secure OT in critical infrastructure. But neither document addresses continuing concerns that OT security still doesn’t get the budget it warrants.

Russia reportedly bans Snapchat and FaceTime,"Roskomnadzor, Russia&#39;s federal agency for monitoring and censoring mass media, has blocked access to Snapchat and FaceTime in the country, Bloomberg reports, citing Russian news service Interfax. The bans were reportedly put in place because the platforms were used &#34;to organize and carry out terrorist acts,” and commit fraud.It&#39;s not clear if either service is still accessible by using a VPN, but banning Snapchat and FaceTime fits with Russia’s crackdown on communication and social platforms that started after the country’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Facebook and X were blocked in March of that year, and Instagram was added to the ban list not long after. In 2024, the encrypted messaging app Signal was also banned, and more recently in July 2025, Russia threatened to block access to WhatsApp.Engadget has contacted both Apple and Snap to comment on the Russian bans. We&#39;ll update this article if we hear back.Banning or restricting these platforms is a way to exert control over where and how conversation happens in Russia — and prevent the spread of &#34;LGBT propaganda,&#34; if you believe Roskomnadzor&#39;s reasoning for banning Roblox — but it might also be an attempt to drive people to use &#34;MAX,&#34; a state-run super app that offers services like communication, banking and document storage. The app is part of a long-standing push to rely on Russia&#39;s tech industry rather than foreign companies, and could potentially give the Russian government an easier method for surveilling its citizens, The New York Times reports.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/russia-reportedly-bans-snapchat-and-facetime-194906404.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcreatr-images%2F2019-04%2F96bcf060-6529-11e9-bf9f-25ab9c35286c&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=392fe962ecc19fc6997a5e698b33a19d02f1676f,https://www.engadget.com/apps/russia-reportedly-bans-snapchat-and-facetime-194906404.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-04T19:49:06Z,8,Tech
FBI Says DC Pipe Bomb Suspect Brian Cole Kept Buying Bomb Parts After January 6,"The 30-year-old Virginia resident evaded capture for years after authorities discovered pipe bombs planted near buildings in Washington, DC, the day before the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack.",,https://www.wired.com/story/fbi-says-dc-pipe-bomb-suspect-brian-cole-kept-buying-bomb-parts-after-jan-6/,https://www.wired.com/feed/category/security/latest/rss,2025-12-04T19:42:18Z,3,Cybersecurity
Amazon reportedly considering ending ties with the US Postal Service,"Amazon is reportedly considering discontinuing use of the US Postal Service and building out its own shipping network to rival it, according to The Washington Post. The e-commerce behemoth spends more than $6 billion a year on the public mail carrier, representing just shy of 8 percent of the service&#39;s total revenues. That&#39;s up from just shy of $4 billion in 2019, and Amazon continues to grow.
However, it sounds like that split might be due to a breakdown in negotiations between Amazon and the USPS rather than Amazon proactively pullings its business. Amazon provided Engadget with the following statement regarding the Post&#39;s reporting and its negotiations with the USPS: 
&#34;The USPS is a longstanding and trusted partner and we remain committed to working together. We’ve continued to discuss ways to extend our partnership that would increase our spend with them, and we look forward to hearing more from them soon — with the goal of extending our relationship that started more than 30 years ago. We were surprised to hear they want to run an auction after nearly a year of negotiations, so we still have a lot to work through. Given the change of direction and the uncertainty it adds to our delivery network, we&#39;re evaluating all of our options that would ensure we can continue to deliver for our customers.&#34;
The auction Amazon is referring to would be a &#34;reverse auction,&#34; according to the Post. The USPS would be offering its mailing capabilities to the highest bidder, essentially making Amazon and other high-volume shippers compete for USPS resources. This move would reportedly be a result of the breakdown in talks between Amazon and the USPS. 
Over the past decade, Amazon has invested heavily in shipping logistics, buying its own Boeing planes, debuting electric delivery vans and slowly building out a drone delivery network. Last year, Amazon handled over 6.3 billion parcels, a 7 percent increase over the previous year, according to the Pitney Bowes parcel shipping index. USPS, for its part, handled roughly 6.9 billion, just a 3 percent increase over 2023. That is to say that Amazon&#39;s shipping network can already handle over 90 percent of the volume of the US Postal Service (at least by sheer numbers).
The USPS has been in dire financial condition for some time, losing billions of dollars a year. Negotiations between Amazon and the public carrier have reportedly stalled, which, together with the agency&#39;s need to keep raising its prices, may create more urgency for the company to eliminate its reliance on the service altogether.
The Postal Service has struggled to modernize and adapt (its attempt to electrify the truck fleet was a bust) in a market where the likes of Amazon and Walmart are investing billions in delivering packages around the country at lightning speed. The ever-accelerating digitization of communication and heavy investment in privately owned shipping operations threatens the very existence of one of the country&#39;s greatest public goods.
Update, December 4, 2025, 2:24PM ET: This story has been updated with a statement from Amazon and more details about the &#34;reverse auction&#34; the USPS reportedly wants to conduct if it no longer works with Amazon.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/amazon-reportedly-considering-ending-ties-with-the-us-postal-service-144555021.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2023-03%2Fae61c1f0-c740-11ed-afbf-7073debeb38d&resize=1400%2C1050&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=ee38d6bea806265d0002af32aaddf731ae4c143a,https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/amazon-reportedly-considering-ending-ties-with-the-us-postal-service-144555021.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-04T19:24:34Z,8,Tech

"Meta says it's fixing its broken support system, with the help of AI","If you&#39;ve ever had something go wrong with your Facebook or Instagram account, then you probably have a good idea of just how frustrating the support process can be. The company&#39;s automated processes are so broken that some people have found that suing Meta in small claims court can be a more reliable way of getting help from the company.Now, Meta says it&#39;s trying to address some of these longstanding issues. In an update, the company acknowledged that its &#34;support hasn’t always met expectations&#34; but that a series of AI-powered updates should make it easier for people to get help. The company is rolling out a new &#34;support hub&#34; on Facebook and Instagram that is meant to bring all of its support features into one place. The hub will also have a new AI chat feature so users can ask questions about account issues or Meta&#39;s policies. An in-app support hub might not be that helpful if you can&#39;t access your account, though. A Meta spokesperson pointed to its external account recovery tool, which is meant to help people get back into their accounts. Recovering hacked accounts has long been a pain point for Facebook and Instagram users. But Meta says that it&#39;s now improved the process with better email and text alerts. AI has also helped the company&#39;s systems detect devices and locations you&#39;ve frequently used in the past. &#34;Our new account recovery experience adjusts to your particular situation with clearer guidance and simpler verification,&#34; Meta writes. &#34;We’ve also expanded recovery methods to include taking an optional selfie video to further verify your identity.&#34;Meta is also starting to test a new &#34;AI support assistant&#34; on Facebook that can provide &#34;instant, personalized help&#34; for issues like account recovery or managing your profile. It&#39;s not clear how this will work, or if it will enable people to talk to an actual person who works for Meta. For now, the most reliable way to access live support is via a Meta Verified subscription, though many users report that the chat-based service isn&#39;t able to help with more complex issues.A Meta spokesperson said that the assistant is in the &#34;early stages of testing&#34; and is currently only available to some Facebook users globally. Those who are part of the test can find it via the app&#39;s new support hub. According to Meta, these improvements have already shown some success in helping people get back into hacked accounts. The company says that this year it has &#34;increased the relative success rate of hacked account recovery by more than 30% in the US and Canada.&#34;This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-says-its-fixing-its-broken-support-system-with-the-help-of-ai-185348328.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2Ffb_support_hub.jpg&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=1c63b596f35076dd35bc863a5845c041a7ea3cff,https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-says-its-fixing-its-broken-support-system-with-the-help-of-ai-185348328.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-04T18:53:48Z,8,Tech

The Nintendo Switch 2 Mario Kart World bundle is still on sale for $50 off right now,"Cyber Monday may be long gone, but there are still some deals floating around on the internet today. One deal that wasn&#39;t available on Black Friday but made an appearance on Cyber Monday was a discount on the Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundle. It&#39;s back again today at both Amazon and Walmart — you can get the bundle for $50 off, bringing the final price down to $449. 
For Amazon, you have to add the bundle to your cart to see the discounted price. For Walmart, you&#39;ll need to be signed in to a Walmart account (which is free to make) and add the bundle to your cart to see the sale price. 

  

  
The long-awaited Nintendo Switch 2 came out in June and somehow beat our expectations. We gave it a 93 in our review thanks to features like its larger 7.9-inch LCD screen with HCR and very polished design. We were also impressed by its 256GB of base storage, magnetic Joy-Con and overall much improved performance.  
Nintendo introduced Mario Kart World alongside the new Switch and we&#39;re big fans. It brings wall riding and rail grinds to the Mario Kart franchise in a bright, colorful space. The game is extremely replayable and a great option for anyone looking to quickly pass the time during their travels this holiday season. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-bundle-is-still-on-sale-for-50-off-right-now-150612988.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-04%2Fab91a850-103b-11f0-bffb-9fd894c6d274&resize=1400%2C840&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=46051511a82cf3d3b0ba1ac35576251d49be2e59,https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-bundle-is-still-on-sale-for-50-off-right-now-150612988.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-04T18:32:35Z,8,Tech

Amazon's Kindle Scribe Colorsoft finally has a release date: December 10,"When it announced the latest series of Kindle Scribe writing tablets in October, Amazon didn’t have a specific release date to share beyond “later this year.” And now that we’re approaching the final weeks of 2025, the company is meeting its own deadline by sharing that it will be available on December 10. That detail is now posted on the Amazon product page for the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft, if you’d like to see the date for yourself. 
As a refresher, this is the third generation of the Kindle Scribe line of E Ink writing tablets. This year was the first time Amazon made three different versions of the Scribe, turning it into a series of products. At the entry-level, the Scribe without a front light will start at $430, while the model with a front light starts at $480. The Kindle Scribe Colorsoft, which, as it name suggests, can render colors, will start at $630.
All three flavors will feature the updated hardware and design that’s a bit more symmetrical than previous generations, which had a thicker bezel on one side. They’re also thinner than older Scribes and come with redesigned Kindle software that can help make note-taking a bit more efficient. Based on my hands-on with the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft, it also seemed to render colors more vividly than competing devices like the reMarkable Paper Pro, though I’ll definitely need to get a review unit in for better comparison. 
For now, check out our hands on of the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft and review of the reMarkable Paper Pro and even of the last-gen Kindle Scribe to see if this is something you might want. While December 10 is cutting it pretty close to the holiday gifting season, it’s still weeks ahead of Christmas, so it might still be worth keeping an eye on.

Meta is reportedly going to slash spending on the metaverse,"Meta is reportedly planning steep cuts to its metaverse division, according to Bloomberg. This is happening just a few years after the company changed its name from Facebook to reflect its renewed interest in that same metaverse.
Bloomberg notes that the metaverse department could get hit with significant budget cuts in the near future, with layoffs potentially occurring early next year. The budget cuts could go as high as 30 percent and will likely impact the virtual worlds product Meta Horizon Worlds and the Quest virtual reality headset. The publication did note that this isn&#39;t a done deal just yet.
Company insiders say this is all part of Meta&#39;s annual budget planning for 2026 and that the cuts were discussed at a series of meetings at CEO Mark Zuckerberg&#39;s compound in Hawaii. The metaverse team was reportedly asked for deeper-than-average cuts because the technology hasn&#39;t exactly taken the world by storm.
As a matter of fact, the whole metaverse idea has been a dud with investors, who see it as a drain on resources. Consumers aren&#39;t exactly keen on the idea either, even if they still buy VR headsets and traditional games. It&#39;s one thing to throw on a headset to shoot bad guys for 20 minutes but it&#39;s a whole other thing to, well, wander around a fake Abercrombie &amp; Fitch for hours looking to spend real money on fake clothing for an avatar.

The report does suggest that Zuckerberg still believes that people will one day spend the majority of their time in virtual worlds, but these cuts signal that he understands that this idea is still years or decades away from fruition. The metaverse sits within a company division called Reality Labs that has lost more than $70 billion since 2021. Zuckerberg has also largely refrained from mentioning the metaverse in public and in earnings calls.
So what will Meta be spending money on instead? It&#39;s reportedly focused on further developing large AI models and chatbots, in addition to hardware products linked to AI experiences like those Ray-Ban smart display glasses.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/meta-is-reportedly-going-to-slash-spending-on-the-metaverse-164547153.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2021-09%2F7c801b30-165e-11ec-be3c-a1e8c6d94899&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=57407159f01c4ce12838d91cca1335d511a45517,https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/meta-is-reportedly-going-to-slash-spending-on-the-metaverse-164547153.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-04T16:45:47Z,11,Tech

From feeds to flows: Using a unified linkage model to operationalize threat intelligence,"
		
					  
						




The problem: Static intelligence in a dynamic world



Every CISO knows the fatigue that comes with modern threat intelligence. Dozens of vendor feeds pour in daily — STIX packages, IP blocklists, domain indicators, malware hashes — all claiming to help your organization stay one step ahead.



Yet most threat feeds still behave like spreadsheets of badness. They tell you what to watch for, but not why it matters or how it moves through your environment.



The result is a paradox of abundance: CISOs have more data than ever before, but less operational clarity. Analysts are overwhelmed by indicators disconnected from context or mission relevance.



Each feed represents a snapshot of a potential threat, but it does not capture the dynamic pathway through which that threat could exploit relationships within the enterprise.



Traditional intelligence products describe discrete artifacts; real-world attacks exploit linkages amongst users and cloud services, between supply-chain vendors and data repositories, between identity providers and DevOps pipelines.



The shift from threat feeds to threat flows requires a model that can describe those linkages, quantify their trustworthiness and prioritize risk based on how threats actually travel.



That’s where the Unified Linkage Model (ULM) comes in.



Rhizomatic networks and the modern attack surface



Classical network defense models assume hierarchical systems — servers at the core, clients at the edge and clear boundaries in between. But digital enterprises no longer look like trees; they behave more like rhizomes — living systems of lateral, recursive connections.



A rhizomatic network, a term from Deleuze and Guattari’s A Thousand Plateaus and explored in this context elsewhere, is one where any node can seemingly connect to almost any other, directly or indirectly, through APIs, shared identity layers or multi-cloud infrastructure. In these environments, roots have become less permanent and topologies have become less predictable. Within this landscape, dependencies emerge dynamically and relationships evolve faster than documentation can keep up. This shift from hierarchy to rhizome changes the way we know how threats propagate. A compromise in one SaaS tenant can ripple laterally through adjacent cloud accounts, CI/CD pipelines or shared identity providers with surprising speed.



Attackers no longer exploit static perimeters — they weaponize relationships.



The ULM provides a structured way to visualize this chaos. By mapping three core linkage types — adjacency, inheritance and trustworthiness — the ULM reveals how risk moves rhizomatically through complex ecosystems. It transforms modern network entanglement into something quantifiable, allowing CISOs to reason about propagation rather than static exposure.



The unified linkage model (ULM)



The ULM was conceived initially to describe how cyber risk propagates through interdependent systems — not merely by asset or vulnerability, but by relationship. Instead of seeing networks as linear hierarchies, ULM views them as living ecosystems where risk flows along three primary linkage types:




Adjacency linkages: Proximity or shared interfaces between systems, such as network segments, APIs or shared infrastructure.



Inheritance linkages: Dependencies and configuration flows, such as a compromised library in a build pipeline or inherited IAM policies.



Trustworthiness linkages: Human or contractual relationships, such as vendor access, federated identities or service-to-service tokens.




Each linkage represents a potential path of exploitation. Rather than treating each threat artifact in isolation, ULM maps how those artifacts connect — showing how an attacker could traverse from an initial compromise point to an ultimate target through adjacency, inheritance and trust.



This concept reframes threat intelligence from collection to connection. In the ULM view, the organization’s environment is not simply a list of assets but a graph of interactions. Threats are not isolated incidents but flow across linkages.



From feeds to flows: Building a living threat graph



Imagine receiving a feed that reports a malicious IP address associated with a phishing campaign. In most SOCs, that indicator enters a SIEM rule or firewall blocklist — a transactional act of defense. The intelligence stops there.



Now apply ULM thinking:




The malicious IP is associated with a compromised third-party marketing tool.



That tool has API keys embedded in your marketing automation system.



The automation platform uses OAuth tokens that connect to your corporate CRM.



The CRM is integrated with your cloud identity provider.




Each linkage forms part of a threat flow — a connected chain of potential exploitation that moves laterally through business processes, not just through ports and protocols.



By mapping linkages, the CISO can see that the “malicious IP” is not an isolated data point; it’s the first observable in a multi-stage flow that touches customer data, credentials and identity infrastructure.



When threat intelligence is structured as linkages, not lists, analysts can:




Correlate faster: Identify shared infrastructure or behavior patterns across feeds.



Prioritize better: Focus on threats that intersect with high-value or high-trust linkages.



Predict earlier by anticipating propagation through modeling adjacent or inherited dependencies.




In other words, threat feeds become threat flows — intelligence with direction, momentum and consequence.



Operationalizing ULM in threat intelligence pipelines



1. Ingest and normalize



ULM begins by ingesting diverse threat feeds — commercial, open-source, government and internal telemetry. Each artifact (IP, domain, hash, tactic or technique) becomes a node in the linkage model, enriched with metadata such as MITRE ATT&amp;CK techniques, timestamps or confidence scores.



2. Establish linkages



The system identifies relationships between nodes using multiple criteria:




Adjacency: Shared IP ranges, ASN or cloud hosting; shared libraries or API keys.



Inheritance: Supply-chain dependencies, build-system components or configuration drift.



Trustworthiness: Credential sharing, federated SSO connections, vendor contracts or known trust relationships.




Linkages are scored for strength and directionality — similar to weights in a graph — producing a threat-linkage graph showing how a compromise could cascade across systems.



3. Integrate with MITRE ATT&amp;CK and TIPs and FAIR



ULM aligns naturally with MITRE ATT&amp;CK’s technique-level data.Each linkage can be annotated with the ATT&amp;CK tactics it enables — from Initial Access to Impact. Integration with Threat Intelligence Platforms such as MISP or ThreatConnect allows ULM graphs to update dynamically as new indicators appear.



A previously benign linkage can instantly become high-risk when connected to a newly malicious node, turning static intel into a living, breathing operational map.



Similarly, the ULM bridges quantitative risk frameworks like FAIR and FAIR-CAM by embedding linkage dynamics into loss-event modeling, thereby enabling risk assessments not only of the magnitude of loss but of the pathway through which loss may propagate.



4. Visualize threat flows



Visualization is key. And in the emerging environment of AI/ML models and cloud-based resources, this visualization can occur. Using ULM, CISOs can see attack pathways as flow diagrams rather than spreadsheets.



For instance:



A connection to a compromised supplier’s GitHub repo (inheritance linkage)



→ injects code into a shared container image (adjacency linkage)



→ which is deployed into production through an automated pipeline (trust linkage).



Such visualizations reveal choke points where a single control — code-signing enforcement or identity segmentation — can break multiple flow paths at once.



ULM as a bridge between intelligence and authorization



One of the persistent frustrations in enterprise security is the divide between intelligence and governance. Threat feeds inform SOCs; frameworks like NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2, ISO/IEC 27001:2022 or the CMMC 2.0 Model govern compliance. The two rarely meet.



ULM provides the connective tissue.



Because ULM formalizes relationships between systems, it can feed directly into risk management frameworks:




NIST RMF Step 1–2 (Categorize/Select controls): Use ULM to identify linkage-dense areas where compromise would have the highest propagation potential.



Step 3–4 (Implement/Assess): Validate that controls exist along key linkages — authentication boundaries, code-inheritance chains, vendor access.



Step 6 (Monitor): Continuously refresh linkages with new threat intel, transforming continuous monitoring into continuous linkage validation.




In compliance contexts, ULM metrics — such as linkage density, trustworthiness scores and adjacency exposures — become measurable inputs for CMMC maturity, ISO 27001 risk registers or Zero Trust Architecture (SP 800-207) policy enforcement.



A threat flow, therefore, is not only a technical visualization but an auditable artifact of due diligence.



Zero trust and the flow perspective



Zero trust architecture (ZTA) is often summarized as “never trust, always verify,” as formalized in NIST SP 800-207. ULM adds nuance by showing what to verify and where trust actually exists. Every trust boundary in a zero-trust design corresponds to one or more linkages in ULM:




A user authenticating through an identity provider — a trustworthiness linkage.



A microservice calling another via API — an adjacency linkage.



A software update pipeline pulling from a third-party repo — an inheritance linkage.




When threat intelligence is mapped onto those linkages, the CISO gains real-time visibility into which trust paths are under active threat.



Instead of treating zero trust as a static segmentation map, ULM enables a dynamic trust model — continuously updated by threat-flow data.



This approach converts zero trust from an architectural goal to an operational feedback system. Each linkage is verified not only against access policies but also against active threat flows.



CISO use case: Prioritizing by linkage impact



Consider two simultaneous alerts:




A phishing domain targeting the finance department.



A compromised API key in a DevOps integration.




Both seem essential, but which deserves immediate attention?



A traditional feed-based approach might treat them equally. The ULM view quickly shows that the API key sits on a high-trust, high-inheritance linkage — it connects the build system to production containers and those containers share adjacency with customer data stores.



The phishing domain, by contrast, leads to isolated user inboxes with strong controls. By quantifying the linkage weight, the CISO can prioritize the DevOps compromise, knowing that its flow potential — the ability to move from one system to another — is far higher. This is attack-path prioritization, not just vulnerability management. It is the difference between chasing every indicator and focusing on the flows that matter.



Toward a flow-based defense



Security teams often describe their posture in terms of perimeters, boundaries, endpoints or controls. But adversaries don’t think in boxes — they believe in flows. They exploit the connective tissue: the forgotten trust token, the unmonitored CI/CD handoff, the shared SaaS credential.



The ULM provides a way to think and act like an attacker while maintaining the analytical rigor of a defender. By modeling linkages, CISOs can:




Visualize attack surfaces: Understand not just what assets exist, but how they relate to each other.



Quantify propagation risk: Measure how fast and far a compromise could move.



Operationalize threat intel: Feed dynamic linkage updates into monitoring and response playbooks.



Align intelligence with compliance: Demonstrate to auditors and boards that risk is understood in context.




In practice, adopting ULM doesn’t require replacing existing tools. Most organizations already possess the data — network maps, identity graphs, vulnerability scanners and threat feeds.



ULM unifies them into a linkage framework, transforming siloed outputs into a coherent risk narrative.



The CISO’s call to action



For decades, we have been trained to collect — logs, indicators, feeds. The next era of cybersecurity requires that we understand connections: how elements interact, inherit and propagate.



By adopting a linkage mindset, CISOs can elevate threat intelligence from reactive to predictive. The ULM provides the analytical bridge between static data and dynamic defense — a means to see threats not as isolated alerts but as flows of intent moving through digital ecosystems.



The message is simple but powerful:



Stop simply reading threat feeds.



Start mapping threat flows.



That is how you operationalize threat intelligence in the age of rhizomatic, interconnected systems — and how CISOs finally gain the visibility to act, not just react.

A shaky year for American EVs could set the tone for 2026,"If you like both electric vehicles and emotional roller coasters, 2025 was an excellent year. However, for those of us whose nerves are already sufficiently frazzled, the highs and lows of the last 12 months were a bit hard to stomach.In 2025, we saw the introduction of new, compelling models like the Lucid Gravity and refreshed Nissan Leaf, the latter available at a price on par with its internally combusted competition. From a product availability standpoint, 2025 was the year the EV market started feeling more mature and less manic.But 2025 also saw new heights of anti-EV vitriol stirred up during a particularly traumatic election cycle. The means of propulsion or badge on the hood of your commuter machine suddenly became an indicator of your political affiliations. Put simply, the car you drive is now a political statement, and it’s the latest unprecedented situation in an exhaustingly long and dire string of unprecedented situations. Yes, it&#39;s been a long year, and the pessimism of 2025 will surely carry us well into 2026, but not all hope is lost for EVs.Tesla and the DOGE effectElon Musk flashes his T-shirt that reads &#34;DOGE&#34; to the media as he walks on South Lawn of the White House, in Washington, March 9, 2025.ASSOCIATED PRESSWe&#39;ve certainly seen some civic-minded CEOs in the past as auto executives have a long history of mixing their corporate interests with their political panderings. Chrysler CEO Lee Iacocca was even considered a potential presidential candidate once upon a time. However, we have never seen the kind of ass kissing and cronyism we were privy to in this year&#39;s fickle friendship between Elon Musk and President Trump.Musk was (hyper) active on the Trump campaign trail, and wasted no time digging into what he described as government overspending. While the Department of Government Efficiency&#39;s efficacy is debatable, it certainly proved quite effective at decimating the accounts of Tesla investors. Between January and March, Tesla&#39;s stock price dropped by nearly half. Things didn&#39;t turn around until Musk left DOGE in May. Since then, Tesla&#39;s price has returned to its highs before the DOGE debacle. Its sales, however, have not. Q1 deliveries declined by 13 percent, then 14 percent in Q2. Deliveries bounced back 7 percent in Q3 as everyone scrambled to buy before the EV credits expired, but profits plunged 37 percent. Tesla&#39;s market share in the US electric vehicle space has halved, leading perennial pitchman Musk to start hawking everything from AI agents to spandex-clad robots — anything to distract from the numbers.And it&#39;s apparently working. Musk&#39;s $1 trillion pay package was approved by Tesla’s shareholders without much worry. This could make him the world&#39;s first trillionaire, but only if he meets a series of aggressive targets and deadlines for sales, an area where the man has struggled in the past.The big, beautiful sales spikeA Tesla with a sticker referring to the car&#39;s purchase is shown on Sunday, Dec. 15, 2024 in Concord, Mass.ASSOCIATED PRESSElon Musk and Donald Trump&#39;s bromance wasn&#39;t the only fallout from the latter&#39;s second term. So, too, died the $7,500 federal EV incentive, which expired in September as part of President Trump&#39;s &#34;Big Beautiful Bill.&#34; That actually spurred a short-term sales spike ahead of the deadline. Many manufacturers even set new EV sales records riding that wave, but there&#39;s a disconcerting trough to come.We still need to wait a bit to see just how bad Q4 EV sales are going to be, but early indications are not looking good. J.D. Power&#39;s October report says that EV sales in September were a record high, making up 12.9 percent of new vehicle sales in the US. In October, after the credit expired, they fell to a mere 5.2 percent. That&#39;s a worrying drop, and it&#39;s already affecting product planning. Cuts in EV productionHonda&#39;s Super-One Prototype isn&#39;t coming to the US. Tim Stevens for EngadgetWhen I was in Japan last month, getting an early look at some next-gen hybrids from Honda, I wasn&#39;t expecting to hear talk of midterm American elections from the company&#39;s executives. But that&#39;s what was on CEO Toshihiro Mibe&#39;s mind. He&#39;s watching American voting trends closely to determine the nature of the company&#39;s upcoming releases.Mibe said that Honda has already canceled plans for some EVs here in America, instead focusing on a broader selection of hybrid models. It&#39;s not the only company to do so. Ram also canceled its 1500 EV truck, but the hybrid version is still supposedly on the way. Scout Motors, too, has been focusing more on its extended-range hybrid offerings. The company&#39;s initial pitch was purely electric trucks and SUVs. Lately, it&#39;s been prioritizing its extended-range EV options based on the feedback from its 130,000 pre-orderers. 80 percent of them want the onboard generator, an add-on that may prove a saving grace for this EV startup.There is reason for optimismSome manufacturers may be throttling back on their EV aspirations, but others are forging ahead. There&#39;s a delightful collection of battery-powered machines coming next year, and that&#39;s worth getting excited about.Again, the 2026 Nissan Leaf should be a hugely popular choice as its production ramps up. It&#39;s already hitting dealerships now, and with a starting price under $30,000, it&#39;ll be hard to beat. But, Chevrolet is going to try with a refreshed Bolt EV for similar money.If you&#39;ve got more to spend, you&#39;ve got more options. BMW&#39;s stellar iX3 crossover SUV is due soon, as are both the electric CLA sedan and GLC SUV. The most anticipated EV of the year, though, might just be the Rivian R2. This electric SUV will join the stellar R1S and R1T, expanding Rivian&#39;s segment footprint while also hopefully expanding its market reach. A $45,000 starting price makes it far more attainable than any of the company&#39;s previous offerings. A photograph of the Rivian factory producing the company&#39;s R1 SUV variant.Nathan Heleine / RivianIf the prospect of a fun, affordable SUV from Rivian doesn&#39;t have you excited for the upcoming year in EVs, maybe some promising news from Europe will. After cutting its own EV incentive program in 2023, Germany&#39;s EV sales fell off a cliff, dropping 28 percent in 2024. Cue the predictions of the demise of EVs by many local pundits.Since then, though, EV sales slowly climbed back up, and lately they&#39;ve been booming, with German road traffic agency KBA saying the total number of newly registered electric vehicles increased by nearly 50 percent in October (year over year). Electric cars now make up 19 percent of the market there, and that&#39;s despite Tesla&#39;s sales cratering.There&#39;s no guarantee that the American market will follow a similar rebound, especially if the anti-EV political messaging continues. Me, though, I&#39;ve decided I&#39;m staying optimistic, as exhausting as that can be these days.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/a-shaky-year-for-american-evs-could-set-the-tone-for-2026-153000210.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-08%2F8532d0d0-7c60-11f0-b5f5-aa9ed72fa30d&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=2a8f3e3e450a472e39146f103f456044d01c51bd,https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/a-shaky-year-for-american-evs-could-set-the-tone-for-2026-153000210.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-04T15:30:00Z,10,Tech
Windows shortcuts’ use as a vector for malware may be cut short,"
		
					  
						




A longstanding problem with the way Windows handles LNK shortcut files, which attackers have been abusing for years to hide malicious commands in plain sight, may finally have been fixed, with more than one patch now available to users.



The problem was that threat actors could mask a harmful payload in the Target field of an LNK file downloaded from the internet, adding whitespace padding so the payload was hidden from anyone inspecting the field.



Microsoft has been reluctant to classify the issue as a vulnerability.



“We have investigated this report and determined that it does not meet the bar for classification as a vulnerability,” Microsoft said in a November 2025 advisory. “Microsoft Defender has detections in place to detect and block this threat activity, and the Smart App Control provides an extra layer of protection by blocking malicious files from the internet.”



However, third-party patch provider 0patch noted in a blog post that a recent Windows update quietly addressed the issue by forcing the Target field to display all arguments. Even so, the company said, the exploit can still succeed. It said its own micropatch offers a more effective solution.



The two fixes land after years of reported LNK file exploitation by APT groups from North Korea, Iran, Russia, and most recently by a China-linked campaign against European diplomats. 



Microsoft’s patch



Windows shortcut files (.lnk) have long been a convenient hiding place for attackers because Windows Explorer only displayed the first 260 characters of the command in a shortcut’s properties. Anything appended after a long string of spaces stayed invisible to the user.



The issue is tracked as CVE-2025-9491, with security analysts assigning a high-severity CVSS rating of 7.0.



“A .lnk file structure allows the target arguments to be a very long string (tens of thousands of characters), but the ‘Properties’ dialog only shows the first 260 characters, silently cutting off the rest,” 0patch researchers said. “So it is possible to construct a .lnk file that runs a really long PowerShell or BAT script, but only the first 260 characters of it would be shown to the user who viewed its properties.” These shown characters can be mostly whitespaces, pushing the malicious element entirely out of sight.



To the victim, the .lnk file looked like it opened a folder or launched a trusted application, but in reality, it could execute an arbitrary script, a dropper, or living-off-the land command.



0patch researchers confirm the issue to have been somewhat resolved after Microsoft quietly” bundled a fix into its November Windows Updates. “There was no mention of anything remotely akin to this issue among its 63 patched vulnerabilities,” the researchers said, adding the fix was likely applied under the guise of a functional bug rather than a security vulnerability.



“Now, the ‘Properties’ dialog of a .lnk file shows the entire Target command with arguments, no matter how long it is,” the researchers added. Microsoft did not immediately respond to CSO’s request for comments.



0patch claims its patch is better



0patch has a problem with Microsoft’s patch, which it says fixes only the user-interface (visibility) part and not the underlying Windows behavior (executing a malicious command). The assumption behind Microsoft’s patch is that users can manually spot malicious commands in longer .lnk Target fields once they are fully displayed.



0patch argues it is likely to fail on two counts. First, only experienced IT users can tell if the Target field carries malicious executables by just looking at them. And second, in most legitimate cases, .lnk files with Target fields longer than 260 characters are created programmatically (using Windows API) and are defaulted to be automatically processed by Windows Explorer and not manually.



So, Microsoft’s patch still allows a hidden malicious script to execute if the user fails to recognize and block it.



To solve this, 0patch proposes its own micropatch for versions of Windows from 7 through 11 22H2 and Windows Server from 2008 R2 through 2022. If a process opens a .lnk file through Windows Explorer and the Target field exceeds 260 characters, it simply truncates the Target to 260 characters and displays a warning that a suspicious shortcut was shortened. This both alerts the user and prevents malicious execution, and 0patch claims the fix successfully handled more than 1000 malicious shortcuts previously identified by Trend Micro.

PlayStation teams up with Bad Robot and the creator of Left 4 Dead for a co-op shooter,"Sony Interactive Entertainment has signed a deal to produce and publish a game from Bad Robot, JJ Abrams’ production company. The two sides are keeping most of the details close to their chest for now, but the game is a four-player co-op shooter for PlayStation 5 and PC directed by someone who knows a thing or two about that genre: Left 4 Dead creator Mike Booth.Bad Robot Games — which is a fully remote studio — was formed in 2018 with the help of Tencent. It has lent a hand on games including Weird West (as an investor and creative consultant) as well as interactive streaming series Silent Hill: Ascension. This new game is the first one that Bad Robot Games is developing in-house.A few months back, Booth dropped into the Left 4 Dead subreddit to say that he was working on a new co-op game “built on the foundations of what made L4D special. If you enjoyed the teamwork, tension and replayability of my past games, you’ll probably find this one interesting. It expands on the co-op formula in ways I’ve wanted to explore for a long time.” He added that, while the game was still in early development, Bad Robot was opening up a waitlist for access to playtests.According to a press release, “Bad Robot Games is a dedicated game studio working on new and existing transmedia franchises.” So, this project could well be part of an entirely new franchise, but the prospect of co-op shooter from the designer of Left 4 Dead that’s set in the Cloverfield universe is pretty darn intriguing.

Antigravity A1 drone review: FPV flying unlike anything else,"The Antigravity A1 is what happens when Insta360’s 360-degree cameras are given wings and flying feels like a video game. Spinning out as its own brand, Antigravity’s debut drone is a big swing: a three-piece set with a drone that captures 8K 360-degree video, FPV goggles and a motion controller.Challenging the dominance of DJI’s (many!) consumer drones is a big ask. Antigravity’s approach is to play to its strengths in 360-degree video and smartphone-first editing. A lot of the appeal comes from how the A1 captures 8K video in all directions, meaning you can edit, cut and swap around your footage — and hopefully rarely miss a moment you’re trying to document. It’s a lot of fun, too, if you can get through the early teething issues, updates and the learning curve.The droneAntigravity A1 drone reviewImage by Mat Smith for EngadgetThe A1 drone is just 249 grams (0.548 lbs). This helps it bypass some drone regulations, though flying permissions vary by region. The pair of cameras mounted on the top and bottom of the drone&#39;s body is one of its unique features. It’s difficult to directly compare the A1 against competitor drones, as it offers a mix of features found across different categories and some unique tools of its own.The A1 can capture 360-degree video at up to 8K resolution, and thanks to Insta360’s action cam experience, it can magically remove the drone body from video. This means you can capture video and never see propellers or, well, any part of the drone itself.Along the base of the drone, two landing gears automatically lower when you attempt to land the A1, although you will have to manually retract them when you’re looking to launch the drone. You can also lower the landing gear from one of the controller’s many buttons.The removable battery has a handy one-touch gauge to monitor levels and provides over 20 minutes of flight time, depending on conditions and whether you’re recording video. Antigravity suggests it should last up to 24 minutes during normal filming use. My review device came with two spare batteries and a charging dock. It’s very easy to swap out the batteries, and the charging dock can fully charge a single cell in 45 minutes and even charge all three slots at once. There’s a microSD card slot on the rear of the drone, alongside a USB-C port for (slowly) charging the battery.Antigravity A1 drone reviewImage by Mat Smith for EngadgetThe cameras have a 1/1.28-inch sensor, f/2.2 lens aperture and an ISO range from 100 to 6,400. To adjust those settings beyond auto, you’ll have to dive into the menu inside the goggles, which can be laborious to navigate with a gesture-based controller. Fortunately, auto ISO and white balance are usually good enough. Pro-level content creators might want to tinker with levels here, and there’s a histogram you can toggle on or even a zebra pattern to highlight overexposed shots and areas. and the A1 can record 8K video at up to 30fps or 4K at up to 100fps. You can also meet in the middle, with a 5.2k recording mode.There are also three different flying modes, which are easy to select on the controller. Alongside Normal mode, Sport mode increases the maximum flight speed and offers “enhanced flight performance,” improves control sensitivity and turns off obstacle avoidance. Sport mode offers a tangible difference when flying the A1: it doubles the horizontal flight speed compared to Normal mode. There’s also a Cinematic (C) mode, with a lower max speed for smoother video footage.The controller and gogglesAntigravity A1 drone reviewImage by Mat Smith for EngadgetThe flight mode switcher is one of many controls, wheels, buttons and sliders that pepper the surface of the A1’s grip controller. Intriguingly, though, the main way to control the A1 drone is through gestures, not joysticks or buttons. Instead of pitching control sticks to the left and right, up and down, it’s more akin to a video game, where you point the controller where you want to go, shown with a reticle, and pull the trigger. The A1 then shoots off in that direction.The crucial part is that this doesn’t have to be where you’re “looking” from the drone’s POV. This means you can strafe and fly in any direction without your view being constrained by static cameras. It’s a sensation unlike any other drone I’ve flown. It feels more like playing a video game — like piloting a helicopter in GTA 5. You’re able to look in any direction, both while in motion and while hovering stationary.There are controls for recording video, controlling vertical flight and rotating your POV without turning your head. There’s even a RTH (return to home) function that can be accessed by long-pressing the emergency brake button.The included goggles deliver a crisp view of everything, with a pair of 1.03-inch micro-OLED displays with a resolution of 2,560 × 2,560 and a 72Hz refresh rate. Other FPV drone goggles typically offer 100Hz refresh rates, but it wasn’t a dealbreaker for me. I feared that latency hiccups could make airsickness an issue while flying the A1, but I didn’t experience it. My take is that being able to fully control your view makes nausea less of an issue.Another nice touch, especially if you’re flying with friends, is a circular outer display on the goggles, so everyone can see what the A1 sees. Naturally, it can’t encompass the entire view of the drone pilot, but there’s also nothing duller than watching someone else fly a drone. This offers a mild respite. The other eyepiece is a touchpad for steering through menus inside the goggles without having to point and click with the controller.PerformanceAntigravity A1 drone reviewImage by Mat Smith for EngadgetWhile the Antigravity A1 may offer a more immersive drone-flying experience, in pure numerical terms, it lags behind some competitors. For example, even in Sport mode, the A1 tops out at a maximum speed of just under 36 mph, falling behind the likes of DJI’s Avata 2 (60 mph).I was still pleasantly surprised by how responsive the A1 felt, especially in Sport mode. An additional FPV mode (accessible from the goggles) adds more sensitive controls, although I haven’t been able to test it much since it was introduced in a recent firmware update.For someone with more gaming experience than drone piloting hours, Antigravity’s central control system fits like a glove. I could fly where I wanted, confident in the controls and in the knowledge that I would capture what I wanted to. According to Antigravity, you can fly the A1 within a 10km transmission range, although I didn’t manage to test that limit in central London.The experience of starting with the drone felt, at times, unnecessarily arduous. Pairing everything together has to be done in a specific order: power up drone, power up goggles, power up controller. And turning off each item isn’t a typical long press of the power button. Instead, you use a press-once-press-it-again-and-hold method that I forget pretty much every time.Downloading video from the A1 to your phone is also laborious, but that’s not a flaw specific to this drone. Antigravity has attempted some shortcuts, including a microSD card quick reader that connects to your phone or PC via USB-C.However, at the time of testing, manually connecting the microSD is less of an option and more of a necessity. The drone repeatedly failed to connect to the companion app and reliably transfer video files. Some video files recorded seemingly evaporated between firmware updates, only to reappear later. Another file had been converted to two separate circular views, one from each camera, which made it essentially unusable. Hopefully these intial teething problems have been solved by firmware updates and won&#39;t be in retail devices.It’s a shame everything isn’t more stable, especially when both flying the A1 and using Antigravity’s editing software are bothis so beginner-friendly. It&#39;s something I’ve mentioned before with the parent company’s action cams, but the ability to create barrel rolls, tilt rotations with just one tap or click is, again, just fun. And because you can reframe and tinker with video warping, create tiny planet effects or simply crop to a more traditional, cinematic camera view, Antigravity’s software offers almost infinite ways to present your drone footage. Deeptracking can be done both during recording and editing in post, keeping a moving subject or point of interest centered as the A1 zips around.There are also AI-powered video editing features to chop up your 20 minutes of flying footage into something digestible and engaging with minimal effort. Because it’s a 360-degree video, the footage can be easily cropped to suit both horizontal and vertical formats.However, with a smaller sensor and 8K resolution spread across a 360-degree view, the A1 is not the best video drone. The video is pleasingly crisp and clear, and while the footage is best recorded in bright daylight or other well-lit locations, murky British November days didn’t affect it much. As the A1 has to stitch together its two sensors, there’s often a visible seam to your video, but it’s usually a very subtle glitch. It might stop some video creators from tapping it for their most polished aerial shots though. Recording video later in the day resulted in more noise and less detail. This is when the A1’s Cinematic mode (and generally slower flying) is a good idea, but it still won’t make up for the fact that this drone’s sensors are covering such wide angles. More video-centric drones will deliver cleaner video and better performance in less-than-ideal lighting conditions.Wrap-upAntigravity A1 drone reviewImage by Mat Smith for EngadgetThe Antigravity A1 is available now, with a standard bundle including the drone, controller and goggles for $1,599. The Infinity Bundle ($1,999) adds two extra batteries, quick reader dongle, sling bag and a charging dock. That does make it substantially more expensive than rival FPV drones like the DJI Avata 2, but the A1 is also a very different kind of drone.The intuitive controls and ability to look all around you make it unlike anything else currently available. It’s a delightful introduction to drones, FPV or otherwise, but a shame that software issues marred my tests. Plus, pairing all the devices can be convoluted and frustrating at times.If Antigravity is thinking about what to do next, I’d be intrigued to see a version with the camera bonafides to take on similarly priced DJI drones. But that shouldn’t detract from the company’s debut model since the A1 is arguably the most intriguing consumer drone since the Mavic Pro.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/antigravity-a1-drone-review-140026021.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F8ed5d600-d0fc-11f0-aafb-4a3d4e1199d3&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=5c546b75a1bfc02e6134178e0da99952f5b801b6,https://www.engadget.com/cameras/antigravity-a1-drone-review-140026021.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-04T14:20:07Z,10,Tech
Apple's AirPods 4 with ANC are back on sale for $99,"If you missed the Black Friday sale on Apple&#39;s AirPods 4 with ANC, you&#39;re in luck — they&#39;re back on sale at the same $99 price for a substantial $80 savings (45 percent). What&#39;s more, if you&#39;re one who frets about damaging your gear, you can grab them with AppleCare+ for $118, saving 43 percent from the normal price.  
We think that the AirPods Pro 2 are the best AirPods overall, but the ANC-enabled AirPods 4 are also a solid choice, especially at this price. We gave them a score of 86 in our review. 

  
 
Apple&#39;s AirPods 4 come in two variants, with and without ANC. Though the base model is solid, the version on sale here with ANC offers a number of advantages like Conversation Awareness, Adaptive Audio and Transparency mode. They also have a charging case that supports MagSafe and Qi-compatible wireless charging, along with a built-in speaker that emits beeps when you activate Find My. And as Apple recently announced, AirPods 4 with ANC supports the company&#39;s Live Translation feature.  
Our main reservation with the AirPods 4 with ANC is that the Airpods Pro 2 are a better noise-cancellation option when they go on sale. At this price, though, the AirPods 4 with ANC are a real bargain if you&#39;re looking for new buds — especially if you prefer the open-ears type. As mentioned, for extra peace of mind you can also get the Airpods 4 with ANC plus AppleCare+ protection for $118, or 43 percent off.

UK fines porn company £1 million for weak age checks,"The UK has fined a porn operator called AVS Group £1 million ($1.33 million) for failing to have strong enough age checks, regulator Ofcom announced. The company which was also hit with an additional £50,000 fine for its failure to respond to information request and now has 72 hours to introduce effective age checks or face a further penalty of £1,000 a day. 
In July, the UK government announced it would start checking compliance by websites that publish or display pornographic content to implement a system for &#34;highly effective age checks.&#34; Methods approved by Ofcom include credit card checks, photo ID matching and even estimating a user&#39;s age with a provided selfie. However, users have been circumventing the age checks via methods like using a VPN and providing a fake ChatGPT-generated photo ID. 
The fine is the third such penalty arising from the UK&#39;s Online Safety Act designed to protect children and adults from harmful content. In October, 4Chan was also hit with a £20,000 ($26,700) fine for failing to comply with the internet and telecommunications regulator&#39;s request for information under the same law.
The UK isn&#39;t the only region to have implemented age checks. Around half of US states now require it, as do France, Italy, Australia and China. Australia took things a step further by banning social media use by children under 16, including sites popular with young people like Twitch and YouTube.
Ofcom&#39;s safety director, Oliver Griffiths, said the crackdown on weak age verification for adult sites would continue. &#34;The tide on online safety is beginning to turn for the better. But we need to see much more from tech companies next year and we’ll use our full powers if they fall short.&#34;This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/general/uk-fines-porn-company-%C2%A31-million-for-weak-age-checks-130056578.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-12%2F1d8636c0-d0f7-11f0-9be5-e37f4a3063b5&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=75f4c0e79c313a7091158dca0391dc4f0f65a81a,https://www.engadget.com/general/uk-fines-porn-company-%C2%A31-million-for-weak-age-checks-130056578.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-12-04T13:00:56Z,7,Tech

Submarine cable cybersecurity: protecting critical infrastructure,"
		
					  
						




Between 95 and 99% of the world’s data traffic travels through submarine cables. An extensive network of more than 1.3 million kilometers, which travels across the seas and oceans, from shore to shore. According to TeleGeography, there are 650 of these infrastructures in operation or in the pipeline, mainly operated by private companies. Whether we can connect to the internet, back up our computer files, make a bank transaction with our cell phone or communicate with other people depends to a large extent on whether nothing happens to the submarine cables that cross the world from one coast to another.



In recent times, numerous incidents where the breakage of a cable leaves a territory without connectivity are proof that despite their critical nature. They are not always properly protected: in the Baltic Sea alone, between 2022 and July 2025, ten cases of submarine cable breakage were recorded, seven between November 2024 and January 2025. In most of these incidents, international governments interests were suspected to be behind them, with Chinese or Russian involvement. In a complicated geopolitical context, these types of events, in which there remains some doubt as to whether they are accidental or intentional, put the focus on the need to ensure protection. Both at the physical and cybersecurity levels.



The US think tank Atlantic Council identifies several trends that threaten the security of submarine cables. On the one hand, linked to the geostrategic issue, the presence of authoritarian governments are reshaping the internet’s physical layout through companies that control internet infrastructure, to route data more favorably, interrupting the provision of services or taking advantage of infrastructures for espionage. In addition, network management centers have moved from locations close to cable entry points to remote ones, which adds new levels of risk. Finally, with the rise of technologies such as cloud computing, 5G or IoT, the volume of data transmitted over these cables has increased, but also their sensitivity, as more and more sectors depend on these tools for their performance. Once again, these are added factors for which cybersecurity and security policies for these critical infrastructures need to be reviewed. In fact, the European Union is taking action, with a Cable Security Action Plan published in February 2025 that alludes not only to the physical challenges, but also to the need for cyber protection. But with the vast majority of cables in the hands of private companies, the approach they take is critical.



Dealing with the cybersecurity of submarine cables



In this new scenario, big technology companies are becoming major players thanks to their growing presence as a project developer: in a decade, Google, Meta, Amazon and Microsoft have gone from having 10% of international capacity to 71%. Asked how they address issues of infrastructure protection and cybersecurity, Google says they focus on the physical aspect. “Security is a key factor in all our infrastructure investments. Routes are deliberately chosen with many factors in mind, and methods such as shielding and cable burial are used to protect submarine cables.” Google says fishing boats and ship anchors as the greatest physical risk, and notes that “the best protection against these risks and any other physical damage is to build a network infrastructure that achieves resilience, in part, through multiple diverse network routes. Our philosophy is to create sufficient concurrent network paths at metropolitan, regional and global levels, along with a scalable software control plane, to support traffic redistribution and minimize network congestion. When physical damage occurs, redundant network paths can reroute traffic to minimize service disruption for customers and users.”



One of the Spanish companies most involved in this global network is Telxius, a subsidiary of Telefónica. The company stresses that “submarine cables are more than just infrastructure; they are the backbone of the global digital ecosystem. In a hyperconnected world, submarine cables are essential and are part of a broader digital ecosystem that goes beyond the coast to key data centers,” the company says. Regarding the physical protection of this type of critical infrastructure, the company points to a significant improvement in recent times. “Physical accessibility is limited, so redundancy and resilience are still essential to guarantee continuity in the event of accidental damage caused by fishing, anchoring or natural phenomena such as earthquakes or landslides which, in the absence of redundancy, could affect service continuity”. In terms of cybersecurity, there is a twofold perspective. On the one hand, “it guarantees diversity and redundancy in all our terrestrial and submarine routes, which allows us to maintain service continuity with high availability even in the event of outages”. They exemplify this with the case of its transatlantic route, where Telxius offers what they call redundant connectivity through its two state-of-the-art submarine cables: Marea and Dunant.



In addition, from the Telefónica subsidiary they talk about protecting the infrastructure through a comprehensive security model. “In terms of cybersecurity, Telxius adopts, for its IT systems, networks and devices, a multi-layered approach and leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning for real-time threat detection.” This comprehensive model would thus combine different elements including physical measures and cybersecurity in the mooring stations, periodic audits and continuous evaluation, continuity and disaster recovery plans, periodic testing and clear protocols for crisis action, training and awareness to reduce social engineering risks and the use of AI and machine learning for proactive detection and risk mitigation. “And all this from regulatory compliance in key areas: business continuity, information security, environmental management and energy efficiency,” they summarize. A necessary framework to ensure the continuity of an infrastructure on which much of modern life depends.

"The best VPN deals: Up to 88 percent off ProtonVPN, Surfshark, ExpressVPN, NordVPN and more","With a good virtual private network (VPN), you can stream TV shows and events from all over the world, protect your information from hackers and thwart those online trackers that watch you sleep and show you weird personalized ads. Although we strongly recommend using a VPN, you shouldn&#39;t jump on just any deal — a bit of comparison shopping goes a long way in this market. The pricing you see on VPN websites is often not an accurate portrayal of what you&#39;ll actually pay.
Even so, there are some great bargains on the table. Most VPNs now have their Black Friday deals live, and you can save anywhere from 67 to 88 percent on annual subscriptions to the best VPNs. Most of these discounts only apply if you sign up for a year or more, but committing is not a bad idea — while you pay more at the start, if you divide the cost by the months of service, it&#39;s significantly cheaper over time.
Most of the deals we highlight below follow that pattern, so make sure you&#39;re comfortable with a longer commitment before you take the plunge. If you&#39;ve been thinking about subscribing to a VPN service, read on for the best VPN deals we could find right now.
Best VPN deals


ExpressVPN Basic — $68.40 for a two-year subscription with four months free (81 percent off): This is one of the best VPNs, especially for new users, who will find its apps and website headache-free on all platforms. In tests for my ExpressVPN review, it dropped my download speeds by less than 7 percent and successfully changed my virtual location 14 out of 15 times. In short, it&#39;s an all-around excellent service that only suffers from being a little overpriced — which is why I&#39;m so excited whenever I find it offering a decent deal. This Cyber Monday deal, which gets you 28 months of ExpressVPN service, represents an 81 percent savings. Be aware, though, that it&#39;ll renew at the $99.95 per year price.
ExpressVPN Advanced — $88 for a two-year subscription with four months free (77 percent off): ExpressVPN recently split its pricing into multiple tiers, but they all still come with similar discounts for going long. In addition to top-tier VPN service, advanced users get two additional simultaneous connections (for a total of 12), the ExpressVPN Keys password manager, advanced ad and tracker blocking, ID protection features and a 50 percent discount on an AirCove router. It&#39;s rare to see ExpressVPN doing anything for Cyber Monday, so give this deal some serious thought. As above, note that it renews at $119.95 annually.
NordVPN Basic — $80.73 for a two-year subscription with three months free (74 percent off): NordVPN gets the most important parts of a VPN right. It&#39;s fast, it doesn&#39;t leak any of your data and it&#39;s great at changing your virtual location. I noted in my NordVPN review that it always connects quickly and includes a support page that makes it easy to get live help. NordVPN includes a lot of cool features, like servers that instantly connect you to Tor. This early Black Friday deal gives you 74 percent off the two-year plan, which also comes with three extra months.
NordVPN Plus — $105.03 for a two-year subscription with three months free (74 percent off): In another early Black Friday discount, NordVPN has also taken 74 percent off its Plus subscription. For only a little more, you get a powerful ad and tracker blocker that can also catch malware downloads, plus access to the NordPass password manager. A Plus plan also adds a data breach scanner that checks the dark web for your sensitive information.
Surfshark Starter — $53.73 for a two-year subscription with three months free (87 percent off): This is the &#34;basic&#34; level of Surfshark, but it includes the entire VPN; everything on Surfshark One is an extra perk. With this subscription, you&#39;ll get some of the most envelope-pushing features in the VPN world right now. Surfshark can rotate your IP constantly to help you evade detection — it even lets you choose your own entry and exit nodes for a double-hop connection. That all comes with a near-invisible impact on download speeds. With this year-round deal, you can save 87 percent on 27 months of Surfshark.
Surfshark One — $61.83 for a two-year subscription with three months free (88 percent off): A VPN is great, but it&#39;s not enough to protect your data all on its own. Surfshark One adds several apps that boost your security beyond just VPN service, including Surfshark Antivirus (scans devices and downloads for malware) and Surfshark Alert (alerts you whenever your sensitive information shows up in a data breach), plus Surfshark Search and Alternative ID from the tier below. This extra-low deal gives you 88 percent off all those features. If you bump up to Surfshark One+, you&#39;ll also get data removal through Incogni, but the price jumps enough that it&#39;s not quite worthwhile in my eyes.
CyberGhost — $56.94 for a two-year subscription with two months free (83 percent off): CyberGhost has some of the best automation you&#39;ll see on any VPN. With its Smart Rules system, you can determine how its apps respond to different types of Wi-Fi networks, with exceptions for specific networks you know by name. Typically, you can set it to auto-connect, disconnect or send you a message asking what to do. CyberGhost&#39;s other best feature is its streaming servers — I&#39;ve found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites. Currently, you can get 26 months of CyberGhost for 83 percent off the usual price.
hide.me — $69.95 for a two-year subscription with four months free (75 percent off): Hide.me is an excellent free VPN — in fact, it&#39;s my favorite on the market, even with EventVPN and the free version of Proton VPN as competition. If you do want to upgrade to its paid plan, though, the two-year subscription offers great savings. Hide.me works well as a no-frills beginner VPN, with apps and a server network it should frankly be charging more for.
Private Internet Access — $79 for a three-year subscription with four months free (83 percent off): With this deal, you can get 40 months of Private Internet Access (PIA) for a little bit under $2 per month — an 83 percent discount on its monthly price. Despite being so cheap, PIA has plenty of features, coming with its own DNS servers, a built-in ad blocker and automation powers to rival CyberGhost. However, internet speeds can fluctuate while you&#39;re connected.
What makes a good VPN deal
Practically every VPN heavily discounts its long-term subscriptions year-round, with even sharper discounts around occasions like Black Friday/Cyber Monday. The only noteworthy exception is Mullvad, the Costco hot dog of VPNs (that&#39;s a compliment, to be clear). When there&#39;s constantly a huge discount going on, it can be hard to tell when you&#39;re actually getting a good deal. The best way to squeeze out more savings is to look for seasonal deals, student discounts or exclusive sales like Proton VPN&#39;s coupon for Engadget readers.
One trick VPNs often use is to add extra months onto an introductory deal, pushing the average monthly price even lower. When it comes time to renew, you usually can&#39;t get these extra months again. You often can&#39;t even renew for the same basic period of time — for example, you may only be able to renew a two-year subscription for one year. If you&#39;re planning to hold onto a VPN indefinitely, check the fine print to see how much it will cost per month after the first renewal, and ensure that fits into your budget.

Best white elephant gift ideas 

  
According to legend, the King of Siam would give a white elephant to courtiers who had upset them. The recipient had no choice but to simply thank the king for such an opulent gift, knowing that they likely could not afford the upkeep for such an animal. It would inevitably lead them to financial ruin. This story is almost certainly untrue, but it has led to a modern holiday staple: the white elephant gift exchange. These gift ideas will not only get you a few chuckles, but will also make your recipient feel (slightly) burdened.

The best microSD cards for the Nintendo Switch 2,"The Nintendo Switch 2 is here, and that means lots of people will have to buy a new microSD card. While the device comes with 256GB of storage built in, some new games chew up a ton of space. Cyberpunk 2077 is a 60GB download, for instance, while Split Fiction checks in at 69GB. Other titles aren’t nearly as big, but it’s easy to see how you could wind up deleting and redownloading games within a couple months.When you do want to add room, you’ll need a microSD Express card. The “Express” part is important: These are not the same as the old reliable microSD cards you may have bought for the original Switch or other gaming handhelds — they’re newer, faster and significantly more expensive. They’re also your only choice. If you’re looking for the best microSD card for the Switch 2 today, we’ve broken down what you should know before you buy. 
The best microSD cards for the Switch 2 (aren&#39;t all that important) 

 
 
 
  Jeff Dunn for Engadget
 
 
The Switch 2 is the first mainstream device to require microSD Express for storage expansion, so there aren’t many options available to buy just yet. Of the handful of compatible models released thus far, we’ve tested six: the SanDisk microSD Express Card (aka the “SanDisk GamePlay microSD Express Card” at Walmart), the Lexar Play Pro, the Samsung microSD Card for Nintendo Switch 2, the PNY microSD Express Card, the GameStop Express microSD Card for Nintendo Switch 2 and the Onn microSD Express Card. The first four are made by genuine storage manufacturers, while the GameStop and Onn cards appear to be rebadged versions of other models. We used the 256GB version of every card except for Lexar Play Pro, which was 1TB. 
After timing these microSD Express cards across a range of Switch 2 games, our advice is simple: Get whichever one is in stock for the lowest price in the capacity you want. They aren’t identically fast, especially if you want to move a game to the card from the console’s internal storage (or vice versa). But the differences in load times and overall performance within actual games are tough to notice unless you have a stopwatch handy. 
All five cards loaded up the digital version of Mario Kart World, for instance, between 18 and 20 seconds. Each loaded the first Grand Prix race in about 6.5 seconds. Getting to the start screen of Cyberpunk 2077 took about 38 or 39 seconds in each case. Loading a save in a particularly asset-heavy area (Jig-Jig Street) then took between 26 and 29 seconds, depending on the card. (The one exception was with the Onn card, which averaged closer to 31 seconds with that particular task, though that’s also the cheapest choice.) 
With Fast Fusion, a smaller native Switch 2 game, the initial load always took six to seven seconds, while each card loaded the first championship race in roughly 4 seconds. It was a similar situation with the Switch 2 upgrade for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (using a Switch 1 cartridge): Each card took just over six seconds to get to the start screen, between 19 and 20 seconds to load a save just before the final boss, about 16 seconds to fast travel between Kakariko Village and Korok Forest, and so on. We saw no significant issues with in-game loads when playing each game, either. 

 
 
  The SanDisk microSD Express Card and Lexar Play Pro.
 
 
  Jeff Dunn for Engadget
 
 
All of this suggests that the Switch 2 has a relatively specific target for these cards to hit, and that there may not be much room for one model to leap too far out in front of the others. We’ll also note that the console’s built-in storage was consistently faster than any external option: The gap wasn’t always big, but no card truly outpaced it in any of our tests. Loading that demanding area in Cyberpunk, for example, took about 22.5 seconds on average. So if you want the absolute fastest load times, don’t put your game on a card at all. 
If you need the mental comfort of knowing you technically have the best card available, get the SanDisk microSD Express Card. It had no outliers across our many game loading tests, and it was consistently right near the top when it came to moving games to and from system storage, which means it offers strong sequential read and write performance. Benchmark testing on PC with tools like CrystalDiskMark backed this up, as noted in our broader microSD card buying guide. 

  
Putting Mario Kart (a 21.9GB file) on that card took four minutes and 39 seconds on average, which was only second to the Lexar Play Pro by six seconds. It was the fastest to write Fast Fusion (3.5GB), taking an average of 27 seconds across three runs. Only PNY’s card was faster to move games back to the console’s storage, but that one was far slower at writing games to the card — getting Mario Kart on there took seven minutes and 11 seconds on average. Just note that the 128GB version of SanDisk’s card has slower sequential writes than the larger versions, including much slower sustained write speeds (100 MB/s vs 210-220 MB/s). So transferring a game to that particular model will take much longer. The Onn card was also slower to move games back to system storage, taking about 50 seconds more than the SanDisk with Mario Kart and nearly three minutes longer with Cyberpunk. 
Practically speaking, though, speed differences aren’t as important in this case as having lots of space to hold games at a price you can live with. To make things easy, we’ve listed every Express card we’ve seen at retailers at the time of writing below. Remember: You want microSD Express, not “Extreme,” like the branding SanDisk uses for some conventional microSD cards. A microSD Express card will have a big “EX” logo printed on it.

As you can see, while the SanDisk card is fast, it’s also the most expensive of an already-pricey bunch. Is it worth an extra $10-20 to shave a couple seconds off certain loads in certain games, or a couple minutes when moving a game to external storage? Probably not for most people. 
But stock for all of these cards has been a bit patchy since the Switch 2 landed, especially for the Walmart Onn model, which is by far the cheapest choice. If only one card is actually available by the time you read this — and you must have it today — it’s safe to just get it. You won’t lose or gain all that much when it comes to real-world performance. 
Ultimately, though, we still advise holding off on buying a microSD Express card for as long as you can. President Trump’s ongoing tariff shenanigans could spike prices a little higher in the short term, but we&#39;ve only just started to see a few small discounts in recent weeks, and in general, all of these cards should only fall further over time. And compared to traditional microSD options, they are still pricey: The Samsung Pro Plus, for example, costs $17 for 128GB, $27 for 256GB, $50 for 512GB and $95 for 1TB as of this writing. 
The Switch 2 is extremely popular, so more microSD Express cards will need to be made and prices will (eventually) come down. Ideally, we’ll see more high-capacity options as well: Nintendo says the Switch 2 technically supports cards up to 2TB, but so far only a couple even go up to 1TB. All of this means you should try to use all 256GB baked into the Switch 2 first, even if it means having to delete a game or two. But if you absolutely need more space right away, the cards above should be fine. 
What are microSD Express cards?

Most microSD cards are based on a standard called Ultra High Speed (UHS), of which there are three versions: UHS-I, UHS-II and UHS-III. The vast majority of cards you may have bought in the past utilize UHS-I. These have one row of pins in the back and a theoretical maximum data transfer speed of 104 megabytes per second (MB/s). (Though many cards are able to surpass that limit with proprietary tech and card readers.) The original Switch has a UHS-I microSD slot, as do most other gaming handhelds like Valve’s Steam Deck. 
UHS-II cards add a second row of pins and can reach up to 312 MB/s. These are pricier and much less common than cards based on UHS-I, but they’re supported by some cameras and higher-power handhelds like the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X. UHS-III, meanwhile, is twice as fast as UHS-II in theory (624 MB/s), but no microSD cards have actually used it. 
UHS-I cards have held on over the years because they’re cheap, widely supported and fast enough for the things most people need them to do: record 4K video, stash photos and so on. But with the Switch 2, Nintendo needs more. The new console is dramatically more powerful, which allows it to run demanding games that may have originally been built for stronger hardware like the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X or gaming PCs. The device also uses UFS 3.1 storage internally, which is much speedier than the eMMC storage used by the original Switch. (A custom file decompression engine helps improve load times as well.) So if the Switch 2 is going to accept microSD cards, it needs ones that won’t bring a serious drop-off in performance and can hold up with modern games.

Hence, SD Express. This standard has technically been around since 2018 but mostly went nowhere until the Switch 2 came along. It also uses a second row of pins, but it lets microSD cards take advantage of the PCI Express (PCIe)/NVMe interface, which is the same underlying tech used by modern SSDs. As a result, it can produce considerably faster read and write speeds, with a current theoretical maximum of 985 MB/s. 
As noted above, real-world performance won’t be quite that fast. Even if it was, the best microSD Express cards would still be much slower than the NVMe SSDs used by the PS5 and Xbox. (Sony recommends SSDs with sequential read speeds of at least 5,500 MB/s.) And they’ll fall well below their peak speeds under sustained loads: SanDisk, for instance, says sustained write speeds for its 128GB Express card can drop as low as 100 MB/s. 
But they’re still a marked improvement over old UHS-I cards, and in theory, they should be quicker than some older SATA-based SSDs when it comes loading game levels, asset streaming, retrieving saves or copying games to external storage. Whereas SanDisk’s microSD Express card can produce sequential read speeds around 900 MB/s, Lexar’s Professional Silver Plus — the top UHS-I pick in our general microSD card guide — topped out just over 200 MB/s, and that’s with a proprietary reader. (On the first Switch, it’d be closer to 100 MB/s.) Sequential writes and random speeds were three to four times better as well, and sometimes even more depending on the benchmark we used. 
It remains to be seen how well these Express cards will hold up with years of use, and there’s no way to know exactly when their sky-high prices will drop. Non-Switch 2 devices that support microSD Express are still exceedingly rare, and the standard itself isn’t backwards compatible with UHS-II, so you’ll be limited to UHS-I speeds if you want to use your card with another device (unless you buy a pricey external reader). Still, while the increased costs and limited selection are annoying, the tech itself is worthy of a next-gen Switch. 
How we test microSD Express cards 

 
 
 
  Jeff Dunn for Engadget
 
 
We put our microSD Express cards through a series of tests meant to simulate how people would use each card on the Switch 2 in the real world. We mainly worked with four games: a mid-sized title in Mario Kart World, a small one in Fast Fusion, a relatively large one in Cyberpunk 2077 and a hybrid in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, which ran off a Switch 1 cartridge but used a roughly 10GB Switch 2 upgrade pack that was downloaded and installed digitally. 
We first timed how long it took to move each game from the system’s internal storage to the card in question, and vice versa. We then timed how long it took to load each game when installed to a given card. After that, we measured how quickly the cards could load certain in-game scenarios: the first Grand Prix race in Mario Kart; the first championship race in Fast Fusion; fast traveling between the Jig-Jig Street, Embers and Downtown Central areas in Cyberpunk and fast traveling between the Kakariko Village, Korok Forest and the Hyrule Castle Town Ruins areas in Zelda. (We chose those places in the latter two games because they’re more taxing than other regions.) With Cyberpunk and Zelda, we also timed how long it took to load up different save files in those locations. 
With each test, we completed three to five runs to account for any irregularities and marked down the average time taken between them. We did each test in airplane mode, with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth off, to minimize any performance drain that could arise from background downloads. Between each test, we also spent at least an hour playing the games off each card to ensure there were no significant drop-offs compared to the console’s built-in storage. 
Recent updates 
November 2025: We’ve tested the 256GB version of Walmart’s Onn microSD Express card and edited our guide accordingly. It’s generally slower than most of the other options we’ve tried, especially when moving games to and from system storage, and in synthetic benchmark tests on a PC. But the performance drop-off isn’t particularly noticeable in actual Switch 2 games, so if you see it in stock and just want to pay as little as possible, it’s a decent buy. 
September 2025: We’ve taken another pass through this guide to confirm our advice is still accurate. We’ve also noted a new 512GB version of PNY’s microSD Express card and confirmed that a “SanDisk GamePlay” Express card sold at Walmart has the same performance as the standard SanDisk model we recommend above, just with a different name.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/best-microsd-cards-for-nintendo-switch-2-160052947.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-08%2Fc9ead4f0-7217-11f0-b36b-85ce05100f66&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=9601a6098ebed7034876477898ee1ab1a01aaa4d,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/best-microsd-cards-for-nintendo-switch-2-160052947.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-11-03T08:00:38Z,13,Tech

The best budgeting apps for 2025,"As a former Mint user, I had to find a new budgeting app not too long ago. Intuit, parent company of Mint, shut down the service in March 2024, and prompted users to transition to its other financial app, Credit Karma. However, after testing Credit Karma myself, I found it to be a poor Mint replacement — that meant I needed to branch out and look elsewhere for a trusted app to track all of my financial accounts, monitor my credit score, follow a monthly spending plan and set goals like building a rainy-day fund and paying down my mortgage faster. I tried out Mint&#39;s top competitors in the hopes that I&#39;d be able to find a new budgeting app that could handle all of my financial needs. Hopefully my journey can help you find the best budgeting app for you and your money as well. 
Best budget apps of 2025 

  

  

  

  

  
Other budgeting apps we tested 
PocketGuard 
PocketGuard used to be a solid free budget tracker, but the company has since limited its “free” version to just a free seven-day trial. Now, you’ll have to choose between two plans once the trial is over: a $13 monthly plan or a $75 annual plan. When I first tested it, I found it to be more restricted than NerdWallet, but still a decent option. The main overview screen shows you your net worth, total assets and debts; net income and total spending for the month; upcoming bills; a handy reminder of when your next paycheck lands; any debt payoff plan you have; and any goals. Like some other apps, including Quicken Simplifi, PocketGuard promotes an “after bills” approach, where you enter all of your recurring bills, and then PocketGuard shows you what’s left, and that’s what you’re supposed to be budgeting: your disposable income. 
Although PocketGuard’s UI is easy enough to understand, it lacks polish. The “accounts” tab is a little busy, and doesn’t show totals for categories like cash or investments. Seemingly small details like weirdly phrased or punctuated copy occasionally make the app feel janky. More than once, it prompted me to update the app when no updates were available. The web version, meanwhile, feels like the mobile app blown up to a larger format and doesn’t take advantage of the extra screen real estate. Ultimately, now that the free tier is gone, it just doesn’t present the same value proposition as it once did. 
How we test budgeting apps 
Before I dove in and started testing out budgeting apps, I had to do some research. To find a list of apps to try out, I consulted trusty ol’ Google (and even trustier Reddit); read reviews of popular apps on the App Store; and also asked friends and colleagues what budget tracking apps (or other budgeting methods) they might be using for money management. Some of the apps I found were free and these, of course, show loads of ads (excuse me, “offers”) to stay in business. But most of the available apps require paid subscriptions, with prices typically topping out around $100 a year, or $15 a month. (Spoiler: My top pick is cheaper than that.) 
All of the services I chose to test needed to do several things: import all of your account data into one place; offer budgeting tools; and track your spending, net worth and credit score. Except where noted, all of these apps are available for iOS, Android and on the web. 
Once I had my shortlist of six apps, I got to work setting them up. For the sake of thoroughly testing these apps, I made a point of adding every account to every budgeting app, no matter how small or immaterial the balance. What ensued was a veritable Groundhog Day of two-factor authentication. Just hours of entering passwords and one-time passcodes, for the same banks half a dozen times over. Hopefully, you only have to do this once. 
Budgeting app FAQs 
What is Plaid and how does it work? 
Each of the apps I tested uses the same underlying network, called Plaid, to pull in financial data, so it’s worth explaining what it is and how it works. Plaid was founded as a fintech startup in 2013 and is today the industry standard in connecting banks with third-party apps. Plaid works with over 12,000 financial institutions across the US, Canada and Europe. Additionally, more than 8,000 third-party apps and services rely on Plaid, the company claims. 
To be clear, you don’t need a dedicated Plaid app to use it; the technology is baked into a wide array of apps, including all of the budgeting apps listed in this guide. Once you find the “add an account” option in whichever one you’re using, you’ll see a menu of commonly used banks. There’s also a search field you can use to look yours up directly. Once you find yours, you’ll be prompted to enter your login credentials. If you have two-factor authentication set up, you’ll need to enter a one-time passcode as well. 
As the middleman, Plaid is a passthrough for information that may include your account balances, transaction history, account type and routing or account number. Plaid uses encryption, and says it has a policy of not selling or renting customer data to other companies. However, I would not be doing my job if I didn’t note that in 2022 Plaid was forced to pay $58 million to consumers in a class action suit for collecting “more financial data than was needed.” As part of the settlement, Plaid was compelled to change some of its business practices. 
In a statement provided to Engadget, a Plaid spokesperson said the company continues to deny the allegations underpinning the lawsuit and that “the crux of the non-financial terms in the settlement are focused on us accelerating workstreams already underway related to giving people more transparency into Plaid’s role in connecting their accounts, and ensuring that our workstreams around data minimization remain on track.” 
Why did Mint shut down? 
When parent company Intuit announced in December 2023 that it would shut down Mint, it did not provide a reason why it made the decision to do so. It did say that Mint&#39;s millions of users would be funneled over to its other finance app, Credit Karma. &#34;Credit Karma is thrilled to invite all Minters to continue their financial journey on Credit Karma, where they will have access to Credit Karma’s suite of features, products, tools and services, including some of Mint’s most popular features,&#34; Mint wrote on its product blog. In our testing, we found that Credit Karma isn&#39;t an exact replacement for Mint — so if you&#39;re still looking for a Mint alternative, you have some decent options. 
What about Rocket Money? 
Rocket Money is another free financial app that tracks spending and supports things like balance alerts and account linking. If you pay for the premium tier, the service can also help you cancel unwanted subscriptions. We did not test it for this guide, but we&#39;ll consider it in future updates.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/best-budgeting-apps-120036303.html?src=rss",https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2024-12%2Fc68868f0-b7ef-11ef-ba7f-d3c50de0f3d8&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=c86b67a591e4cc8b4a9cf5947d2783382f11c2c7,https://www.engadget.com/apps/best-budgeting-apps-120036303.html?src=rss,http://www.engadget.com/rss-full.xml,2025-09-16T09:00:35Z,13,Tech

Introducing Signal Secure Backups,"

In the past, if you broke or lost your phone, your Signal message history was gone. This has been a challenge for people whose most important conversations happen on Signal. Think family photos, sweet messages, important documents, or anything else you don’t want to lose forever. This explains why the most common feature request has been backups; a way for people to get Signal messages back even if their phone is lost or damaged.

After careful design and development, we are now starting to roll out secure backups, an opt-in feature. This first phase is available in the latest beta release for Android. This will let us further test this feature in a limited setting, before it rolls out to iOS and Desktop in the near future.

"Privacy is Priceless, but Signal is Expensive","

Signal is the world’s most widely used truly private messaging app, and our cryptographic technologies provide extra layers of privacy beyond the Signal app itself. Since launching in 2013, the Signal Protocol—our end-to-end encryption technology—has become the de facto standard for private communication, protecting the contents of billions of conversations in WhatsApp, Google Messages, and many others. Signal also continues to invest in research and development in the pursuit of extending communications privacy. This commitment underlies our recent work to add a layer of quantum resistance to the Signal Protocol, and our previous work on metadata protection technologies that help keep personal details like your contact list, group membership, profile name, and other intimate information secure. This singular focus on preserving the ability to communicate privately is one reason that we work in the open, documenting our thinking and making our code open source and open to scrutiny—so you don’t have to take our word for it.

New Features Roll Call: Fall 2023,"

You should be able to communicate without worrying that every gossip tidbit, meme, or joke you share and who you share it with will get churned up into fodder for targeted ads or used to train an AI model. You also shouldn’t have to strip your communications down to the barest and most utilitarian version of relaying information.

This is why Signal is dedicated to providing a truly private messaging app, and why we work to constantly make the experience better for everyone who uses it.

We want you to know about the improvements we’re making in Signal, even the smaller ones that simply make the app nicer to use. So, starting here we’re publishing a periodic New Features Roll Call, reviewing multiple new features and quality of life improvements in one place.

Quantum Resistance and the Signal Protocol,"

The Signal Protocol is a set of cryptographic specifications that provides
end-to-end encryption for private communications exchanged daily by billions of
people around the world. After its publication in 2013, the Signal Protocol was
adopted not only by Signal but well beyond. Technical information on the Signal
Protocol can be found in the specifications section of our docs site.

Today we are happy to announce the first step in advancing quantum resistance
for the Signal Protocol: an upgrade to the X3DH specification which we
are calling PQXDH. With this upgrade, we are adding a layer of
protection against the threat of a quantum computer being built in the future
that is powerful enough to break current encryption standards.

This post is written to introduce this work to non-experts, and will review what
quantum computing is and the challenges it presents for current cryptographic
algorithms, before providing a high level overview of how we are adapting our
specifications to answer these challenges. If you would like to skip this
summary and explore our PQXDH specification in depth, you can read our technical
whitepaper here.

Standing firm against threats to private and safe communication,"

Signal exists to provide people everywhere with a tool for real private communication. That’s our only goal, and we take it very seriously. We’re structured as a nonprofit to ensure that market forces can never put profit or expediency over the safety of those who rely on us. Our work also resonates beyond the Signal app. The Signal Protocol has become the foundation for end-to-end encryption technology that is used and trusted by many private messaging services to protect billions of messages every day.

We recognize that privacy is a human right and that free expression and the ability to dissent are fundamental to a safe and vibrant society. But the current state of the Online Safety Bill in the UK puts the future of privacy and expression in grave jeopardy.

"Signal is for everyone, and everyone is different","

The tech industry–its products, conceptual frameworks, linguistic conventions, and cultural norms–is largely centered in the US (and, increasingly, China. But we’re focused here on the US, where Signal is based). This is not because the US has better programmers or more visionary entrepreneurs, but due primarily to historical material conditions. For example, early investments in networked computation from the US military, which happened around the same time that the US was becoming a global superpower, which was followed by the privatization and then commercialization of networked computation, then the dot com boom, etc. etc., and here we are.

Removing SMS support from Signal Android (soon),"For many years, the Signal app on Android has supported sending and receiving plaintext SMS and MMS messages in addition to Signal messages. SMS and MMS are standardized communication protocols that allow mobile devices to send and transmit messages, and most people picking up their phone to text or share memes don’t really think about them.

To give some context, when we started supporting SMS, Signal didn’t exist yet. Our Android app was called TextSecure and the Signal encryption protocol was called Axolotl. Almost a decade has passed since then, and a lot has changed.

position created in collaboration with Signal’s leadership. I am thrilled, and I
can’t think of a more meaningful use of my time, or a greater honor. I’ve been a
friend, admirer, and champion of Signal since it was RedPhone and TextSecure,

Signal is more important now than ever, and I expect this to stay true well into
the future. As President I will dedicate myself to helping Signal build a long
taproot so it can grow and thrive in dynamic climates. In this role I will be

Technology Deep Dive: Building a Faster ORAM Layer for Enclaves,"

Private doesn’t mean lonely. Signal’s mission is to help you connect with people
in a secure way. This means that you need to know which of your contacts are
also on Signal. This is called “contact discovery” and it’s an essential part of
any messaging app.

Most other communications apps enable contact discovery by maintaining their own
internal social graph or by uploading and storing your full address book on
their servers. But Signal enables you to find and connect with people in a
privacy-preserving way. In short, we let you see which of your friends use
Signal, but we don’t want to know who your friends are. Letting you know which
of your contacts are using Signal while preserving the privacy of your social
map requires some complex engineering choices on our end.

In this post, we’ll be diving into some new ways that improve our ability to
handle contacts in a private way. That’s right folks. We’re getting technical.
We’re talking enclaves and memory access patterns. [If you’ve never heard of an
enclave before, don’t worry. We’ll explain it soon.]

Our new method is faster and more efficient. It lays the groundwork for the
introduction of usernames and phone number privacy which will offer new privacy
controls around your phone number’s visibility on Signal.

Improving first impressions on Signal,"

The phenomenon of unsolicited and unwanted messaging dates back to the earliest communication platforms: from prehistoric cave graffiti and postal chain letters to popup ads and robocalls. To prevent spam, most online services rely on large-scale inspection of plaintext conversation content or detailed social-graph analysis to determine who is saying what to whom and whether or not that should be allowed. At Signal, we build on a foundation of privacy and do not have access to that type of data or metadata.

We build Signal in the open, with publicly available source code for our applications and servers. To keep Signal a free global communication service without spam, we must depart from our totally-open posture and develop one piece of the server in private: a system for detecting and disrupting spam campaigns. Unlike encryption protocols, which are designed to be provably secure even if everyone knows how they work, spam detection is an ongoing chore for which there is no concrete resolution and for which transparency is a major disadvantage. If we put this code on the Internet alongside everything else, spammers would just read it and adjust their tactics to gain an advantage in the cat-and-mouse game of keeping spam off the network. The Signal protocols, cryptography, and source code are peer reviewed, shared for independent inspection, and provably private by design. We are bound by these security guarantees, so that your conversations and contacts remain as private and protected as ever, even if we keep spam-fighting tools out of sight.

Embrace ephemerality with default disappearing messages,"

As the norms for how people connect have changed, much of the communication that once took place through the medium of coffee shops, bars, and parks now takes place through the medium of digital devices. One side effect of this shift from analog to digital is the conjoined shift from the ephemeral to the eternal: words once transiently spoken are now – more often than not – data stored forever.

We’ve designed Signal so that your data always stays in your hands. We think there’s something special about sharing a private fleeting moment between friends, so Signal also supports disappearing messages. Now, we’ve added the ability to preconfigure all conversations you initiate with a default disappearing messages timer.

Companies like Facebook aren’t building technology for you, they’re building technology for your data. They collect everything they can from FB, Instagram, and WhatsApp in order to sell visibility into people and their lives.

There are other contenders, such as regional online payments networks (like Venmo in the US), but the data story there is similar.

This is not a future we are particularly excited about. At Signal, we want to help build a different kind of tech – where software is built for you rather than for your data – so these are trends that we watch warily.

Help us test payments in Signal,"

The latest Signal betas are rolling out today. Inside, you’ll find performance enhancements, a slew of bug fixes, improvements to the mute settings, and if you’re in the United Kingdom, you’ll see support for Signal Payments – a new feature that enables you to send and receive privacy focused payments as easily as sending or receiving a message. This is a beta feature in a beta build, but for those in the United Kingdom living life on the edge, please help us test and give feedback.

Help users in Iran reconnect to Signal,"Just over a week ago, we announced that Iranian censors had started blocking all Signal traffic in the country. As an interim solution to help people in Iran get connected again, we’ve added support in Signal for a simple TLS proxy that is easy to set up, can be used to bypass the network block, and will securely route traffic to the Signal service.

This new connection method is supported in the latest Signal Android beta release, and will be rolling out to production users in a few days. Our hope is that this will help many people in Iran start sending and receiving messages again while we continue to explore additional censorship circumvention techniques that will work there.

Research on your terms,"

Signal has always benefitted from our engaged and supportive community, and wouldn’t be what it is without your input and feedback. As the number of people using Signal has grown, so have our efforts to keep pace with what people expect from a messaging app, and where we might find new opportunities for Signal.

Software companies typically overflow with data that explains the past and forecasts possible futures. They know exactly who is doing what with their products, how often, and where. While an abundance of data can contribute to their product and user experience decisions, these data collection practices are often rife with overreach and abuse. Signal doesn’t track you, collect your data, or measure which features you use. Anything and everything you do with Signal is your business. Which means that for us to dial in the features and experiences you expect calls for a respectful practice of research.

New Features Coming to Signal Groups,"





Whether it’s staying in touch with family and friends, planning a party, scheduling an event, getting work done, or organizing for change, group chats are an increasingly important part of Signal.

If you’re excited to try out these features now, you can create a new group to do so. These features will be coming soon to your existing Signal groups in a future update.

Signal groups are built on top of the new private group system technology we previewed last year, which gives you a modern group chat experience while keeping your groups private: the Signal service has no access to your group memberships, group titles, group avatars, or group attributes.

Technology Preview for secure value recovery,"At Signal, we want to make privacy simple. From the beginning, we’ve designed Signal so that your information is in your hands rather than ours. Technologies like Signal Protocol secure your messages so that they are never visible by anyone but you and the intended recipients. Technologies like private contact discovery, private groups, and sealed sender mean that we don’t have a plaintext record of your contacts, social graph, profile name, location, group memberships, groups titles, group avatars, group attributes, or who is messaging whom. Plaintext databases have never been our style. We don’t want to build a system where you trust us with your data; we want to build a system where you don’t have to.

We’ve been working on new techniques based on secure enclaves and key splitting that are designed to enhance and expand general capabilities for private cloud storage. Our aim is to unlock new possibilities and new functionality within Signal which require cross-platform long-term durable state, while verifiably keeping this state inaccessible to everyone but the user who created it.

Stickers are everywhere, and now they’re in Signal too. They’re a fun way to add a new layer of expression to your conversations – and just like every other Signal feature, they are also encrypted, private, and secure.

From: [redacted], [redacted] &lt;[redacted]@amazon.com&gt;
Subject: Notification of potential account suspension regarding AWS Service Terms


Moxie,


Yesterday AWS became aware of your GitHub and Hacker News/ycombinator posts describing how Signal plans to make its traffic look like traffic from another site, (popularly known as “domain fronting”) by using a domain owned by Amazon --  Souq.com.  You do not have permission from Amazon to use Souq.com for any purpose.  Any use of Souq.com or any other domain to masquerade as another entity without express permission of the domain owner is in clear violation of the AWS Service Terms (Amazon CloudFront, Sec. 2.1: “You must own or have all necessary rights to use any domain name or SSL certificate that you use in conjunction with Amazon CloudFront”).  It is also a violation of our Acceptable Use Policy by falsifying the origin of traffic and the unauthorized use of a domain.


We are happy for you to use AWS Services, but you must comply with our Service Terms.  We will immediately suspend your use of CloudFront if you use third party domains without their permission to masquerade as that third party.


Thank you,


[redacted]


General Manager, Amazon CloudFront

Signal Foundation,"Long before we knew that it would be called Signal, we knew what we wanted it to be. Instead of teaching the rest of the world cryptography,
we wanted to see if we could develop cryptography that worked for the rest of the world. At the time, the industry consensus was largely that
encryption and cryptography would remain unusable, but we started Signal with the idea that private communication could be simple.

Since then, we’ve made some progress. We’ve built a service used by millions, and software used by billions. The stories that make it back to
us and keep us going are the stories of people discovering each other in moments where they found they could speak freely over Signal, of people
falling in love over Signal, of people organizing ambitious plans over Signal. When we ask friends who at their workplace is on Signal and they
respond “every C-level executive, and the kitchen staff.” When we receive a subpoena for user data and have nothing to send back but a blank
sheet of paper. When we catch that glimpse of “Signal blue” on a metro commuter’s phone and smile.

Reflections: The ecosystem is moving,"At Open Whisper Systems, we’ve been developing open source “consumer-facing” software for
the past four years.  We want to share some of the things we’ve learned while doing it.

As a software developer, I envy writers, musicians, and filmmakers.  Unlike software, when
they create something, it is really done — forever.  A recorded album can be just the same 20 years
later, but software has to change.

Software exists as part of an ecosystem, and the ecosystem is moving.  The platform changes
out from under it, the networks evolve, security threats and countermeasures are in constant shift,
and the collective UX language rarely sits still.  As more money, time, and focus has gone into the
ecosystem, the faster the whole thing has begun to travel.

All of this means that the set of expectations users have for social and communication features
are evolving rapidly. Anyone building software today knows that it is not possible to stand still.

WhatsApp's Signal Protocol integration is now complete,"

At Open Whisper Systems, our goal is to make private communication simple.  A year ago, we announced
a partnership with WhatsApp and committed to
integrating the Signal Protocol into their product, moving towards full end-to-end encryption for all of their users by default.

Over the past year, we’ve been progressively rolling out Signal Protocol support for all WhatsApp
communication across all WhatsApp clients.  This includes chats, group chats, attachments,
voice notes, and voice calls across Android, iPhone, Windows Phone, Nokia S40, Nokia S60, Blackberry, and BB10.

As of today, the integration is fully complete. Users running the most
recent versions of WhatsApp on any platform now get full end-to-end encryption for every message they send
and every WhatsApp call they make when communicating with each other.  This includes all the benefits of the
Signal Protocol – a modern, open source, forward secure,
strong encryption protocol for asynchronous messaging
systems, designed to make end-to-end encrypted messaging as seamless as possible.

"Signal on the outside, Signal on the inside","A few months ago we completed the process of unifying all of our apps across Android, iOS,
and the Desktop under the name ‘Signal.’  This simplified the language around our apps and eliminated a lot of
confusion. Now we’re doing the same thing “inside” our apps by renaming Axolotl to Signal Protocol.

Axolotl has been the name of the cryptographic protocol that our apps use for end-to-end encryption, but it’s not
the easiest word to pronounce.  Sometimes people use ‘Axolotl’ to refer to just the base double ratchet
instead of the full messaging
protocol, so there has also been some confusion around what people mean when they say ‘Axolotl.’

To continue eliminating confusion and simplifying everything within the Signal ecosystem, we’re renaming
Axolotl to Signal Protocol. The implementations have been renamed, so there are open source Signal
Protocol libraries available for C, Objective C, Java, and JavaScript in our
GitHub repository, as before.  These have been making their
way into an increasing number of communication apps, and we’re excited for the future of the Signal Protocol

changed, and TextSecure now emphasizes the “TextSecure transport,” which uses data rather than SMS. While we remain
committed to supporting plaintext SMS/MMS in addition to the encrypted TextSecure transport so that the app can
function as a unified messenger, we are beginning the process of phasing out support for SMS/MMS as an encrypted
transport in favor of the TextSecure data protocol.

my dive instructor before I even made it underwater. But once I reached the calm depths of the ocean, I went

Conversations ranged over all parts of every project. Words spoken aloud may
have outnumbered lines of code shipped. The entire team was fully engaged and
people nearly had to be dragged out of the house for an afternoon hike to the
top of the ridge.



Despite our intense collective focus on conceptual progress, when
Trevor agreed to present an overview of elliptic
curve cryptography, the entire team, veterans and “li’l Whisperers” alike, fell
silent and gathered ‘round the whiteboard.

We learned about fields and curves and groups, of basepoints and cofactors,
secrets and signatures. Questions abounded and Trevor delivered the answers,
one after another, albeit with enough handwaving that I thought he might lift
off and fly himself back to the mainland. However, there was one question that
even he could not answer: Why are they called elliptic curves?

From Weierstrass to Montgomery to Edwards formats, these geometric objects
that form the essential mathematical underpinnings of many modern crypto
systems are not defined by ellipses, nor do they resemble ellipses. Not
even for very stretchy definitions of an ellipse. There is no immediately
obvious connection. So why do we call them that?

As usual, to understand the universe, we must first bake an apple pie from
scratch. Or at least pretend to.

Surrendering to the Potential of Constraints,"Winter Break Of Code, Day 5


  The prophetic discourse of the Karai can be summed up in an observation and a promise: on the one hand, they constantly affirmed the fundamentally evil character of the world, on the other, they insisted that conquest of a good world was possible. “The world is evil! The world is ugly!” they said. “Let us abandon it!” they concluded. […] In short, it was not the discourse of the prophets that was unhealthy, but indeed, the world in which they spoke, the society in which they lived.


– Archeology of Violence, Pierre Clastres



At the peak of the Soviet Union’s civic society, more than five-hundred thousand Soviets belonged to a complex, almost ecological system of bureaucracy known as the Nomenklatura. Itself a reference to the Roman ‘list of names’ – a codified taxonomy into which people could be organized and signified – the Soviet government was built and constrained through social proximity.

The initial idea was to institute a horizontal decision-making system. A methodology that could define and populate thousands of roles for the collaborative administration of social order: ministers of industry, pedagogy, natural resources, foreign relations, internal affairs, communications, and so on.

It was a form of governance intended to gradually flatten a hierarchy that the early industrial revolution had exaggerated. However, over time the mechanics revealed – somewhat conversely – a total institutionalization of ‘nepotism’. Certain senior members of the Nomenklatura had the privilege to appoint new members, and maintain long lists of qualified candidates. New members, now obliged from a favor, formed allegiances to their patrons. Patrons themselves carried social debts to those who appointed them, and it went on like this up the stack into the inner circle. The hierarchy didn’t flatten, it sharpened.

Speed ahead to our modern life. My social relations are all but completely virtualized. My list of friends and followers, contacts and matches, profiles and handles … all thrum wildly. Apps are released every week which impose and constrain my lists into new formations, reconstructing my social life over and over. It’s possible to see the reflection of Soviet governance in our own lives today; perhaps there are hundreds of thousands of members (less, probably) of a new bureaucratic class – technocratic knowledge workers, let’s say – who organize and signify civic life in the contemporary age. Building cooperative protocols and APIs and apps and networks. Designing the interfaces and behaviors and experiences of everyone else. Teaching but sometimes refusing to learn, giving generously but sometimes taking without permission, anticipating what we want but often supposing what we want without asking. Designing our dismal fate. Slowly appointing their heirs by proximity.

As a publisher and designer, I count myself among this degenerate few and tread carefully whenever I manage to move or speak at all.

Two days ago, I was in New York City, riding the train with millions of other commuters
in the freezing snow. Today, I went surfing on a beach in beautiful Kauai. In the same
absurd fashion, I shared meals, stories, and workspaces with people, who days earlier,
I had only read about and admired from afar. The promises of the Winter Break of Code
seem impossible: a vacation in paradise, large milestones of work to be met, a welcoming
space with talented companions. But when Moxie came into the bedroom this morning strumming
his ukulele to wake us for the daily morning stand-up, up we were, ready to claim the small
victories in the browser extension project, the Signal iOS client, and the Android applications
from the day prior and to lay out plans to further the state of user-friendly secure
communication tools.

Winter Of Code Lineup 2014-2015,"Every year when we do this kind of call for proposals, our experience from past events sets our
expectations higher.  Even with really high expectations this time around, we were blown away by the number of high-quality
proposals we received for this winter.  It’s inspiring to know how many people are thinking seriously about the development
of privacy-enhancing technology, and we hope that one day we’ll have a space large enough to accept all the proposals

Winter Of Code,"This January, Open Whisper Systems will be hosting a Winter Break Of Code.  We’ve managed to get access to a
large beachfront house in Kauai for three weeks, and we’re inviting people to join us.  If you’re interested in spending
one to three weeks in Hawaii working collaboratively on an Open Source project to make private communication simple, we’ll take
care of your airfare and housing so that you can be there.

Winter Break Of Code is an opportunity for designers, developers, writers, strategists, and creative thinkers interested in privacy
and security to spend some time contributing to privacy-related projects in a retreat-like setting with other co-conspirators.
Think of it as an extended hackathon, but with your travel expenses paid, and with breaks for surfing, hiking, swimming, and
just generally being in Kauai.

Everything that Open Whisper Systems produces is free and Open Source.  We’ve been working on apps like
Signal,
TextSecure,
RedPhone, and
Flock
for years now, because we believe that it’s possible to develop well-designed
apps that are both privacy-preserving and a joy to use.

Moments to keep,"Winter Break of Code, Day Six

A lot of great memories will stay with me after this intense week. The house 
surrounded by palm trees, people with computers in every corner, laying down on a 
sofa, chatting on the balcony, and sitting down on the carpet. The surf and hiking 
breaks on this astonishing Kauai’s landscape, sharp mountains covered by forests 
falling into beaches of fine sand and fun waves. The nights spiced with Moxie’s 
tasty cocktails and long deep conversations about the meaning of life, the 
internet and everything.

The value of our confidences,"Winter Break of Code, Day Five



Understanding digital privacy under capitalism


  If commodities could speak, they would say this: our use-value may interest men [sic], but it does not belong to us as objects. What does belong to us as objects, however, is our value. Our own intercourse as commodities proves it. We relate to each other merely as exchange-values.


– Marx, Capital: A Critique of Political Economy, Vol 1.

Thus spake the commodity

Marx saw modernity more acutely than most of his contemporaries, and provided a description of capitalism that remains, in my opinion, quite useful.

However, we must be brave enough to attempt to  understand his description of the relationship between commodity and value in the context of a world very different from Industrial Revolution-era Europe. That is, one which includes the strange new primordial soup of the internet and capital.

Imagine, as Marx expects of us in the passage above, that an “internet” commodity could speak. What would it say?

The Winter Break of Code, being closely linked by name to the season of Winter, began with a calm trickle of ex{hausted,cited} people carrying laptops and cell phone collections after a parade of delays and weather issues. Off the plane after a pitch-black descent, the humid fresh smell distinct to this place along with my feet landing on soil was a good hint that we were indeed on an island and this was actually happening.

The Difficulty Of Private Contact Discovery,"Building a social network is not easy.  Social networks have value proportional to their size, 
so participants aren’t motivated to join new social networks which aren’t
already large.  It’s a paradox where if people haven’t already joined, people aren’t motivated to join.

The trouble is that while building a social network is hard, most interesting software today is
acutely “social.”  Even privacy-enhancing technology, which seems anathema to the aesthetic of 
social networking, is tremendously social.  For people to effectively use private communication software
like TextSecure, they need to be able to know how to contact their friends using TextSecure.

BitHub = Bitcoin + GitHub. An experiment in funding privacy OSS.,"At Open Whisper Systems, we often get emails from people who’d like to donate money to the project.  For an OSS project,
particularly one that aspires to a collective sense of ownership, handling donations is not always entirely straightforward.

The fundamental contradiction is that while donations are meant for a project, they’re traditionally sent to a person.
Even if a project sets up a bank account, there are still only a few people who have access to the money itself, and
distributing it appropriately can be hard to figure out.

It’s never been clear to us how we should handle small donations, so oftentimes when people ask about donating, we just tell
them that the best way to help is to use the software, spread the word, and file well-documented bugs when they find them.  Which
is true!  But it’d also be great if we had a nice system for handling donations that matched our objectives for collective ownership.

"TextSecure, Now With 10 Million More Users","At Open Whisper Systems, we’re working to both advance the state of the art for secure communication
and also reduce the friction required for ordinary people to make use of it.  We want everyone to have
access to advanced secure communication methods that are as easy and reliable to use as making a normal phone call or sending 
a normal text message.

With these goals in mind, we’ve been working with CyanogenMod over the past few months.
CyanogenMod is an open source aftermarket Android firmware distribution with ten million users 
and ~20k installs a day. Their rapid growth is beginning to rival Microsoft for the third-largest smartphone OS distribution.

As of today, the TextSecure protocol will begin shipping as part of the CyanogenMod OS-level SMS provider, in an effort to provide
completely transparent end-to-end text message encryption between all of their users.

Advanced cryptographic ratcheting,"At Open Whisper Systems, we’ve been working on improving our encrypted asynchronous chat protocol for TextSecure.
The TextSecure protocol was originally a derivative of OTR, 
with minor changes to accommodate it for transports with constraints like SMS or Push.  Some of the recent 
changes we’ve made include 
simplifying and improving OTR’s deniability, as well as
creating a key exchange mechanism for asynchronous transports.
Our most recent change incorporates what we believe to be substantial improvements to OTR’s forward secrecy “ratchet.”

Forward Secrecy for Asynchronous Messages,"Traditionally, asynchronous messaging systems such as email have relied on protocols like PGP or S/MIME for
cryptographic security.  These protocols work the way most people are familiar with: one who wishes to receive
encrypted email advertises a public key, and those wishing to send encrypted email to that person encrypt their
outgoing message with that public key.

Simplifying OTR deniability.,"At Open Whisper Systems we help develop TextSecure, an
encrypted chat application for Android.  TextSecure was designed as a general purpose SMS/MMS client which would also 
automatically encrypt conversations when communicating with other TextSecure users.  For those encrypted sessions, TextSecure
uses a compact derivative of the well-known OTR protocol.

We’re currently in the process of transitioning TextSecure to use a device’s data channel as a transport for communication 
with other TextSecure users whenever possible.  This enables communication with the upcoming TextSecure for iOS,
helps users avoid SMS fees, and obscures conversation metadata from telcos.

The transition to a new transport is also a good opportunity for us to evaluate and introduce additional cryptographic 
protocol changes.  Below is one cryptographic protocol change we’re thinking of making that we’d welcome feedback on.

Because secure systems aren’t valuable if they’re not used, Whisper Systems has always focused on delivering strong 
cryptography alongside a great user experience.  That’s the reason call quality has always been a priority in RedPhone’s development.

We know that, for many users, RedPhone has consistently delivered a call quality experience comparable to commercial 
mobile VoIP solutions.  But we also hear from users who report problems like dropped calls, distracting levels of echo 
and latency, or inaudibly low in-call volume.  While we investigate these reports and attempt to resolve them, we don’t 
have a clear view of what situations cause RedPhone’s call quality to degrade, or how to prioritize our development efforts.

All The Things That Pull And Push,"Spring Break Of Code, Day Five



I know very well that each and every crisis of modernity is concentrating, concatenating, and seating more deeply into 
everyday life. I know the struggles of the world’s unseen and unheard are being subsumed – appropriated – under and 
into the framework of a liberal democracy, leaving those at the periphery still under the yoke of capital. The Right further 
entrenches itself into political discourse, both in the United States, and (more extremely) 
abroad (Finland, 
Greece, … et al.). The Left is no less problematic: 
reiterating the petty values of social democracy, negotiating the terms of our entrapment within capitalism. Every season, 
new horrors fall from the clouds and rise from the seas as industrial civilization demonstrates that terraforming can also 
work in reverse. The world’s genetic library – the most prime commons, if ever one existed – is rapidly contracting via 
extinction, privatization, and engineering. The colossal failure of ideology in the twentieth century has left the radicals 
of today no other choice but to see themselves as “post-ideological”. This is a deeply concerning conundrum, as ideology 
survives in post-ideology, different only to the extent that it is less apparent. Yes, it seems like we are living in end 
times – an entire era of Apocalypse – made only more insidious by our optimism in its shadow.

comment that we must be the next Facebook, the next Google; working

expecting a return on investment 10 fold down the line when we exited

not only technologists, but also open source evangelists, activists,
and humanists. Lilia went over

"Dirigibles, Chinese Junk Rigs, and Surfboards","Spring Break Of Code, Day One.

One of the first times I met up with Moxie while travelling, we met at a dive bar in 
San Francisco’s Mission District, packed with hipsters. I had nineteen years, a modified state ID card, and just 
hitchhiked into town. We sat at the bar, and both ordered well gin and tonics.

I had a proposal, the sort of get-rich-quick scheme it seems that only 18th century pirates and lazy hacker-squatters are 
capable of contriving: We fly to China. Then, we spend a few grand purchasing a Chinese junk rig, and equip it with a system 
of pulleys so that we can man the sails from the cockpit, solo if necessary. Next, we fill the cabin with about as much potable 
water as we can carry and enough dried food to stave off starvation, and set a course across the northern arc of the 
Pacific – avoiding the treachery of the South Seas – for San Francisco. The choice of vessel was key, the battened sails 
and flattened hull of a Chinese junk rig make it arguably one of the safest ships to make a transoceanic voyage alone, not 
to mention the financial incentives: being rare in the Americas, a well-kept junk rig would go for anywhere from $50,000 
to $250,000 USD – not to mention grant you free slip fees at just about any marina from Anchorage to Punta Arenas. How could 
anyone turn down such a preposterous plot which included adventure on the high seas, a high mortality risk, riches and notoriety?

Client-side call quality,"In our previous post, we discussed the global infrastructure that allows RedPhone clients 
to find low-latency servers when establishing a call.  This post discusses the techniques we use to retain call quality 
when network conditions are less than ideal.

Creating a low-latency calling network,"RedPhone is our mobile app for end-to-end encrypted voice calls.  When we talk about RedPhone, we tend to 
emphasize the cryptography, and how using it can help keep your communications safe.  What we don’t talk about 
as much is the VoIP application underneath all of that, which it turns out was actually the hard part.

When we were developing RedPhone, we discovered that the cryptographic aspects of it were relatively straightforward. 
What we didn’t anticipate was how difficult the mechanics of delivering high-quality, low-latency, and highly available 
voice communication would be.

This describes the basic strategy we developed for the network side of low-latency and highly available calls.

Spring Break Of Code,"This Spring will be the first Open Whisper Systems Spring Break Of Code, a week-long, expenses-paid retreat to
Maui for folks who like software development, security, and the beach.  We’ve rented a large beachfront house on 
the west coast of Maui for everyone to stay in, and will pay for your airfare.  While there, you can split your 
time between island living and working on an Open Whisper Systems-related project that you propose.

A New Home,"Whisper Systems was a company focused on the development of mobile security software, which was acquired by 
Twitter in late 2011.  Twitter very generously made some of the Whisper Systems software available under an 
Open Source license (GPLv3), which has since been under open development by the community.  The software has 
seen a number of new releases based on that open development, and we’ve been calling the project for this 
continued work “Open Whisper Systems.”  Welcome to the project’s new home.
